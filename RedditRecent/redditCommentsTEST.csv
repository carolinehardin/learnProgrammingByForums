> I cant find any resource to learn this fromwhat did you google for and what results showed up ?;;
I just keep googling stuff like: controller programming, controller inputs into keys, game pad programming, game pad input into java, java game pad scripts. The results just had programs or forums with little to no information that helped me.The only things I can find are close to what I would like but I cant find exactly what I need. And to make this question worse I have no engine to test these scripts in, I usually use things like unity for some testing.;;

Read and follow Clean Code.;;
You should specify language, but in languages like Java, `0.0` is a `double` and `0.0f` is a `float`.Both `double` and `float` are floating-point number formats.  In Java, floats are 4 bytes and doubles are 8 bytes.  They both conform to IEEE 754 standards.;;
Oh, I totally forgot. I'm referring to C/C++ mainly.;;
"0.5 and 0.5f are different values.  In the case where the number is exactly representable as both a float and a double, the difference doesn't really matter, but it can be really important for values that aren't exactly representable, which is most values.  It's about correctness, not efficiency.  If you write something like this:    float f = 0.4;You are not really assigning 0.4 to f, you're assigning 0.4f.  Those are two different values.  Run this program and explain the output:    #include <stdio.h>    int main(void)    {        float f = 0.4;                if(f == 0.4) {            puts(""equal"");        } else {            puts(""not equal"");        }        return 0;    }";;
Interesting, that makes sense, but are these the only kinds of situations where this is an issue, because, particularly as a graphics programmer, I've learned we should basically never check for direct equality like that with a float anyways. Instead we should check that the difference between 0.4 and f are within some kind of acceptable margin. In which case, it seems like the error you're referring to wouldn't matter anyway.;;
As long as you understand that 0.4 and 0.4f are different values, and are okay with that silent implicit conversion, then I suppose it's fine.  It's just that C++ has too many of these hidden gotcha implicit conversions that you probably don't want to fuel that fire.;;
By default a decimal like 0.3 is a double, so if you specify f, it makes the literal a float. ;;
Sorry, I wasn't clear. I know the difference between the two, but a double will be converted to a float when needed in c++, so I was asking whether this little conversion really mattered enough to avoid using the cleaner notation.;;
Well it depends, in GLSL a decimal literal is by default a float. In C++, if you create a vec4 that expects 4 floats, there will be an implicit conversion from your literal doubles to floats - so it's best to post-fix with f. ;;
This is what I was wondering about. Is it better to add the f *because* the implicit conversion should be avoided, or is it for a different reason?;;
Depends on the platform. For some, the conversion from float to double is free, but on other platforms there could be a minor performance implication. Either way, if you're working with openGL, there's no reason not to avoid the cast by just specifying float ;;
It should have been 0.5 is a float and 0.5d is a double. Blasted hindsight!Yeah, I don't know why I used an opengl line as an example. This problem doesn't exist in opengl. It's pleasantly f-free.;;

"[Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) is a pretty powerful tool for web browser automation.It has an ""ide"" or firefox plugin that will record your clicks and typing.

The thing is that the position of the cursor matters. As opposed to filling out a webform.;;

"The expression `new ArrayList<String>()` creates a new object of type `ArrayList<String>` and returns a reference to that object.The declaration `List<String> myList;` declares `myList` to be a variable that can hold a reference to an object of type `List<String>` or any type that extends `List<String>`.Since `ArrayList<String>` extends `List<String>`, a reference to an object of type `ArrayList<String>`, such as that returned by the expression `new ArrayList<String>()`, can be stored in a variable declared to be of type `List<String>`.";;
So only method of type List can be invoked from myList object right?;;
Correct.;;
List is a less specific type than ArrayList.  Or rather, an ArrayList is one type of List.  Since all ArrayLists are Lists, it's fine to have a List reference that actually refers to an ArrayList object.  The reverse is not true — you can't have a reference to a specific type of something that refers to a less specific object.  All ArrayLists are Lists but not all Lists are ArrayLists.;;
In Java, you must declare the type of each variable when you define one. If the variable is a non-primitive type (not a byte, char, boolean, int, long, short, float, or double), then it actually holds a reference. If the declared type is an interface (like List<E>), then the variable must reference something that is an instance of a concrete class that implements that interface.  If the declared type is a class (which can be abstract or non-abstract), then it must hold a reference to an instance of a concrete class that extends that class.  Whenever you invoke a method on a reference, it actually figures out which method to call at runtime! List<E> is an interface, so it wouldn't make any sense to try to invoke its version of any method. Java will use runtime type information (RTTI) to figure out that it actually needs to use ArrayList<E>'s implementation of any method called on myList.  Of course, this also implies that you can only invoke methods from List<E> on myList. So what happens if you want to invoke a method on your ArrayList<E> that it didn't inherit from List<E>? You'll need to do a cast. Of course, you'll want to use the instanceof operator before doing so, since otherwise you may get a ClassCastException at runtime.  These concepts are very important, because they allow the Java language to have polymorphism, which you can read more about [here] (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/polymorphism.html).  I also wrote some really simple code to demonstrate what I've mentioned, you can find that [here] (http://pastebin.com/ZReURwz2).;;
.io is the country-code TLD for the Indian Ocean territory. Since input/output is often shorted to I/O a lot of people have, let's call it, 'off-label' uses for a .io website. From a purely technical perspecitve it doesn't matter if a website is .io, .ca or .pink. TLDs are only there so you can have many registrars that can make domain names. >I know it's a really general question but I have no idea where to start.FAQ on the sidebar.;;
"The `.io` domains are just ""cool"".  They don't serve any other purpose besides looking cool.Same reason why start-ups insist on leaving out the last vowel in their names.";;
Register a domain, setup a server/aquire hosting, design and upload website, profit. ;;
"You just gave a ""no shit"" answer. I wish we could downvote.";;
Seemed like more then he knew by the side note...;;
It's just another one of the vast number of top level domains that are available these days.  There is no benefit to it, other than having a domain that ends in .io.  I guess some people use it if their project is vaguely related to input/output, but again, it's completely meaningless.;;
I assure you, by the time computers can do my job, most other types of jobs will have been automated already. So that is not a problem of our profession, it's a problem for all of society. ;;
For sure.  You'd need fullblown GAI to design and create a program from scratch.  But patches and maintenance jobs can be largely automated through machine learning;;
Someone had to write the program that fixes other programs.;;
And someone has to repair the robot arms that work the assembly lines, but the repairmen are significantly fewer in number than the workers the robots replaced.;;
Repairmen are far from the only people involved with that robot. You have the designers, assemblers, repairmen, etc. It's just restructuring, the jobs move to different fields and workers have to be retrained.;;
"If the company had to pay for the same number of people, but now also for the robots then robots would not be economically viable and would not be used. The reason companies pay for robots is that they provide a significantly better production output per dollar overhead. Robots pull in new costs, but considering how many labourers they outsource it's a net loss of jobs. Now in a world where all is simple and nice the displaced labour finds new fields in which to work; fields that are only economically viable given the new, lower cost of production of everything else. When industrial agriculture made food relatively easy to make people started new industries elsewhere that were not readily mechanized.The problem is that we can't assume there will be an infinite source of new, 'higher level' jobs for the displaced workers to migrate to because why would there be?";;
True, buy you only have to write it once;;
The reasoning given isn't great. In both cases having a single variable allows you to easily change the value if needed. However, using const is a statement that the variable will never change while the program is running. This allows the compiler to enforce this and throw errors if you ever try to accidentally change it and may allow the compiler to perform optimizations it could not otherwise perform. Prefer to use const variables whenever possible so that you can gain these benefits.;;
I see, thanks!;;
The compiler will often optimize it as if it was a `#define`, so it doesn't take up any space or do any calculations at runtime.;;
basically, it's type of variable (like global and local) and constant local variables are what you use as a good replacement for global variables. global variables are bad practice.;;

"The hookproc has to be static,  since it doesn't take a 'this' parameter.In this static function, you can get the pointer from somewhere and call the non-static function    static Class::hookProc(hwnd,wparam,lparam)    {        Class *This = GetWindowLogPtr(hwnd,1);        This->Hookproc(hwnd,wparam,lparam);    }";;
To clarify this example: You need to stuff an instance of your object somewhere the HOOKPROC can access. If you own the window you are hooking and it is on the same thread as your object (or your object is thread safe) then you can stash a pointer to the instance in a one of the slots on the window. There are other places you can stash a pointer but which is correct depends on who you're hooking.;;
https://teamtreehouse.com/library/git-basics/working-with-remote-repositories/githubThere are a good amount of resources out there for teaching git, github and everything in between. Git is a version control system, much like Subversion(SVN).  It helps you keep track and manage changes in your source code as you're writing more complex systems.  Github is merely a web service built on top of Git that allows you to manage these versions in the cloud - and allows for sharing of source control, etc.;;
Git is a version control system- think of it like save files on steroids for your programming projects. In addition to letting you roll back to previous versions, it lets you merge changes from multiple people and from multiple branches off (a branch being when you have multiple changes saved starting from the same point in time). You can find some documentation on using git [here]([https://git-scm.com/documentation)GitHub is a website that lets you host copies of your git repositories online, and it provides a bug tracker and wiki for your project.;;
"Let's say that you and a partner are developing a computer application together. You would each make changes to the software on your own computers and push the changes to a centralized ""repository"" on GitHub. GitHub is based on Git, which tracks changes and helps you merge changes from multiple software developers. You don't need GitHub to use Git, but GitHub definitely helps programmers to collaborate. It also can serve as a backup of your source code.    [**Ry's Git Tutorial**](http://rypress.com/tutorials/git/) and [**Pro Git**](https://progit.org/) are both free resources about Git (and Pro Git discusses GitHub in pretty good detail).";;

Oh, sorry. I didn't actually realize it was a website.....because I'm kinda an idiot.;;
So, if you want to be a programmer, you *really* need to *pay attention to detail*, otherwise, you're just making the entire field shittier.  Not to mention, the bugs, and other security issues you'll probably introduce.Sorry, I have a sore spot for shit like this.  As a hiring manager, when I come across people that don't know the basics, the interviews stop, and you're escorted out of the building.;;
Tough but fair.;;
I'm sorry. I'm only 14 and just getting interested In coding, but I should have googled it. I didn't realize what it was I just saw it mentioned a few times. Again, really sorry.;;
"Your first instinct should be to Google ""GitHub"" first. After you do your research, **then** ask for help.";;
Ok. ;;
I just started learning this stuff last year. Google has been my friend!    Redditors have been extremely helpful when my research wasn't enough.;;
You're not an idiot because you didn't know github was a website. An idiot would wonder what github was and, realizing they don't know, stop trying to learn what github was! It least you asked for help.;;
This is gonna sound like an asshole answer, but it's the best I have. Fuck HostGator, use something easier/less shitty like DigitalOcean/Heroku.;;
Commits 'should' be associated to meaningful discrete updates to a code base.  You want the ability to rollback features and components without impacting unrelated work.;;
I commit every time I leave my desk,  in case the building burns down.How often do you save locally?   Often, I expect.   If you have an easy way to make a backup,  why not use it?;;
I save very often. Should I commit every time I save?;;
Commit whenever you do something meaningful. The commit message should be obvious.;;
Not every time you save.  But when you've made some useful progress.  But do it frequently,  because it is free.;;
Personally, I commit frequently (basically almost as often as someone would hit ctrl+S when writing a text document).You can use rebase to combine commits (and fix any issues) prior to pushing a commit to some remote repository.;;

Your underlying data structure looks fine. What if you created a class which also had the labels stored alongside the Dictionary?Have you looked through github for an equivalent library to help you?

What's the language?;;
Java. ;;
Well, regardless of the language. I'll go ahead and post what I'd do. Split each answer on the new line character into an array, then map the array to parse out the answers into whatever form of object you want, splitting each value on pipes, with the keys being based on position. ;;
split on pipes.;;
So, split on the pipes and just loop 3 increments each time for each user?(user id, answer, time to answer). How would you create an array for the next student though?;;
I would be doing it via a loop. Foreach line in file or similar.;;
You can just create an array of arrays if you want to keep it simple. For each loop you add a new array to the primary array. Honestly it would be better to create a student object with username, answer, and time though. Then create the object and add it to an array.;;
split on | , then split each new string on pipes;;

I'm easily distracted, so I do feel your pain.I would say you can improve your programming abilities without a computer once you're beyond the beginner phase. For example, I can read through a book on C and hand-write small programs in a spiral and verify they work at home later.Studying in groups can help. Perhaps there are other people in your city learning programming together at meetups on Meetup.com.Turning wifi off on your computer/laptop until you need it for a programming question can help.

The statements executed by a `switch` can be any statements.;;

But you can do this:    int foo;    switch (bar) {    case BAZ:        foo = 3;        break;    default:        foo = 4;        break;    }Is this even what you mean when you say switch statement?";;

"> So string is basically the same as what i tried to do with set statement, but it's able to influence variables?Sorry, what? `string` is a type, just like `float` or `int`.

What about if you make the string larger?And what exactly do you mean by making the string larger? In your example, you don't set the string to anything at all, you just declare the variable but never use it. In any case, the string can be any length and it doesn't really affect anything. Note however that `>>` into a string by default reads only up to the next whitespace, so if the user types more than one word only the first word will be put in the string variable and the rest will remain in the input.";;

"I think you're confusing the value held by the variable with the name of the variable. When you do    string something;that creates a variable *named* `something` which is of type `string`. The name of the variable doesn't affect the values it can hold in any way; those are two completely separate concepts. It's just the same as if we changed the word ""age"" so it was called ""aaaaaaaaage"", that wouldn't mean that people could now get older. It's just a name.As for the alternatives the user can enter, that's something that you have to check yourself in the code and handle. So if you want to only accept ""yes"" and ""no"" as answers, you'll have to read in the answer, and then compare it to ""yes"" and ""no"", and if it isn't equal to either of them, then you have to do whatever it is you want to do in such a case; probably you want to print a message to the user telling him to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" and then go back and read the input again.This is what I meant with ""What you type is what you get"" - because there is such an infinite number of different possible things you might conceivably want a program to do, programming languages make you type very verbosely, in great detail, what exactly it is you want done. It isn't really practical for the programming language itself to have tons of special-case functionality, which would also make it potentially very awkward or difficult to do anything the creator of the programming language didn't anticipate. So they provide basic operations, and you combine them together explicitly.>You already pointed out i can't do a string function with numbers?What I said was that you can't name a variable as a number. This should be clear when you consider how variables are used in the code; consider the following:    number = something + 1;If variables could be called names like ""1"", it wouldn't be possible for the computer to know if you were trying to add the number 1 to `something`, or if you meant to add the value of a variable named `1`. So variable names that are numbers simply aren't allowed. In C++, the rule is that the first character of the name can't be a digit, but you can have digits in the rest of the name. So ""a1"" is allowed, but ""1a"" isn't.>which function should i use instead of string?`string` is the right type if you want to read in text strings like ""yes"" and ""no"".But notice one detail here: the word ""function"" carries another meaning in programming. Namely, a function is a named unit of executable code, taking some parameters and returning a result. You have one function in your program: namely, `main()`. So avoid using ""function"" for other things. `string` is a *type*. So are `int` and `float`, they're *types*, so called because they represent different *types* of information: strings of text, integer numbers, and ""floating point"" numbers (numbers that aren't necessarily integers), respectively. So when you say `string foo;` you are declaring that you want a variable named `foo`, which shall be able to hold values of type `string`.Now these things should have been among the very first things explained by any sensible teaching material, so I think I might agree with /u/jesyspa when he said the videos you're watching might not be any good.";;
"okay, so let me try to explain variables in C++. So a string represents a series of characters, like ""wohhhh"" or ""yes"" and ""no"". The floats you've been using so far represent numbers, more specifically numbers with decimal points. All types of variables represent a different thing. The code that your trying to do here is trying to make a string a number, but a string isn't a number.";;
"hm. Try:    string yes_or_no;    cout << ""Qins?"" << endl;    cin >> yes_or_no;    if (yes_or_no == ""yes"") {        I = 0.04;    } else {        I = 0;    }That should do what you want. Now I gotta say, its incredibly hard to read your code. It might help you to try and read a style guide, although at first you probably won't understand most of it.

Why do you think you need an AST? You can handle function calls perfectly well using RPN. Yacc doesn't give you an AST, though you could use to construct one, and the Python AST stuff is AFAIK intended for use when parsing Python code.;;

The shunting yard algorithm can be used to build an AST. You need an additional stack of tree nodes (this is different from the operator stack), which is intially empty. When you would output an operand, you instead create a leaf node from it and push that onto the stack. Whenever you would output an operator, you create a node from it, then pop the two top operands from the output stack (or one if it's an unary operator), and add them as child nodes. Then you push the resulting tree to the output stack.If the expression is well formed, you should be left with one node on the output stack at the end, which is the final AST.There's an implementation in Java [here](https://www.klittlepage.com/2013/12/22/twelve-days-2013-shunting-yard-algorithm/). I've not seen an implementation in Python yet, but if you already have the shunting yard algorithm implemented, then it's a fairly straightforward modification.;;
Sweet, your first paragraph is something I did a lot of googling for but was unable to find. I'll give it a shot!;;
I would move those information in a config file, then push an empty config file to github and put the file on ignore for changes. So you won't accidentally put your real user and pass to github. Throw a meaningful exception in the code if the config file is invalid (= user and password are missing) and maybe write a small setup text in the project description.;;
What do you mean by move the information in a config file? If I'm following the rest of your reply correctly though, you're suggesting that I can just push a version of this file to github that has placeholders and gitignore my file with my actual password - and then write some setup info in the readme, correct? Thanks for the help bud, appreciate it.;;
Yes, I think that's what /u/Feroc meant.Separating thinks like usernames, passwords, hosts, etc from the code itself is a good practice in general, even if you're not making the project public.It will make it easier for other people to run the code themselves without having to modify the source and also allows you to separate your development environment from production easily. ;;

No, you see the thing is the rest of my code is very close to the BSD KNF style except for the function definitions which have the gnu style. I went through the default gnu style to see if there was an option that changed it but I can't find it anywhere.;;
Think of a project (keep it simple) and try and make it.If your Googling every line you write that's fine, don't be afraid to copy code off Stack Overflow or similar, just try and understand it.A simple interactive web page sounds like a good place to start (though you'll have to learn a bit of HTML).;;

You have to practice.  This isn't like watching a soap opera.;;
Your problem is, you're thinking of the project itself.  As an inexperienced programmer, you should be thinking of the individual tasks.  It takes a LOT of practice to be able to conceptualize a project, and create a mental starting point.

There's a good bet, that even some of this simplest functionality, you'll still need to do a good bit of googling and fumbling through just to mark that one task of your list.Once you start working with more complex systems, you're still going to break your projects down like this.  You're most likely going to start creating Software Design Documents, and including User Stories to break down functionality. ;;

"Like other posters have suggested, unit testing is a good idea - in lieu of a static type system it's probably the best tool you have for validating program correctness. Also, I would recommend using as many self-imposed strictures as possible. For example, avoid switching the types of variables or allowing functions to return different types. Throw exceptions instead of returning ""error"" values. If available, use Javascript's ""freeze"" and ""seal"" features. Use the static analysis tools available, like ""use strict"" or Facebook's Flow. Some languages also allow you to use ""assert"" statements for runtime checking. However, you can't - and shouldn't - assert everything  so what to check and when is a difficult judgment call sometimes. ";;

The reasons are (I'm not saying they're right, just stating them):* It lets you change the implementation later without changing your public interface (this is especially important for libraries).* It lets you do bounds checking on variables (in getters).* In theory they'll all be inlined by the compiler anyway.;;
I would like to add that getters/setters allows you to hide complexity or redundancy.For example let's say you have a class that exposes an angle. You could have a getter for both degrees and radians without having to store both, doing the conversion in the getter itself.This also reduces the chance for errors. Let's say you stored the angle in both degrees and radians. You would need to keep track of all the places the angle can change and ensure that both are updated accordingly.Edit: Typos.;;
> It lets you change the implementation later without changing your public interface (this is especially important for libraries).This one.    99% of programs out there are made to be used as code by other programmers. They need to change your variables (invariably) you give them getters and setters and this allows you to upgrade your whole code without worrying about the upgrade requiring them to rewrite their usage of your code. ;;
"Getters and setters aren't really special in this respect.  When you design a class, you come up with its public interface, typically in terms of member functions (and properties, if you're doing C#).  After that you think about what implementation would work well for this interface.  Getters and setters are just part of the interface design; it's not that you already have a member variable and then add getters and setters around it, it's that you have a getter and a setter and you choose to back them with a variable.(Of course, that's how you design in theory.  In practice, you might be doing the design the other way around.  Then you add the getters and setters so that nobody knows.)";;
This is what I agree with. Getters and setters should be for interfacing. Unfortunately I think java beans taught many programmers to always write them for every field.;;
Yeah, I believe Spring requires that you define getters and setters if you want to use the class in a bean.  ;;
It doesn't for javaconfig. You can use constructor injection. ;;
"Be careful. There's a huge amount of misinformation in this thread.>  why DO we go through all of the hassle and boilerplate of wrapping private variables with public getters and settersFor auto-properties, there really *is* no boilerplate. You just add `{ get; set; }`. That's it. Now it's a property, backed by a private variable you didn't even have to write, yet you're free to completely alter that internal representation without breaking the interface other classes rely on, which is the entire point.The field is an abstract *property* of the object. How it gets the value is an *implementation* detail that should be encapsulated. With a property it is.If you expose a raw member variable, you can't change it to a property later without breaking binary compatibility with other code using your assembly,  breaking serialized versions of your class instance, breaking certain types of code that reflects over your class/instances, and in general breaking any code that depended on it being a raw variable, such as coding using at an `out` parameter. There are actually cases where this will change behavior silently without so much as a compiler warning. It also means your code is harder to debug because you can't break on reads/writes to the property, that member can't participate in data binding, so on and so forth.Properties are a fantastic feature of C#, which lets you write code that consumes getters/setters in a clean and natural way. They have tons of advantages and no disadvantages (the exceptions here are ultra technical edge cases). Avoiding them so you don't have to type 10 characters of ""boilerplate"" is bad idea.";;
This is the only accurate response in this thread.>If you expose a raw member variable, you can't change it to a property later without breaking binary compatibility with other code using your assembly,  breaking serialized versions of your class instance, breaking certain types of code that reflects over your class/instances, and in general breaking any code that depended on it being a raw variable, such as coding using at an `out` parameter.That's the meat of it. I also would like to add that consumers writing descendent classes can't override a member field but they can a property.;;
> that consumers writing descendent classes can't override a member field but they can a property.That's a huge one.;;
Scala has taken a similar approach. It's even easier to make basic properties, but somewhat more annoying if you decide you want the setters or getters to actually do anything. ;;
"I think you're missing a small piece of the puzzle:    public Foo X {get; private set;}This is super convenient C# shorthand for properties that are externally read-only, but can be modified from within the class.";;
what is this??? besideds. isnt every privat variable modifieable from within the class.;;
It's an auto generated public getter and an auto generated private setter.Now your class has a Foo property named X which can be accessed conveniently like a public member, but any attempt to assign to X from outside the class will fail because the setter is private.;;
"What happens it you write	public Foo X {get;}And then try to assign to X outside the class? Can you even write it like that, or will it produce an error? ";;

I think it won't have an initial value, and you have no way of giving it a value. Not a very useful patten.;;

"Others have already answered your question, but lombok is a great library for reducing Java boilerplate. This one will create getters, setters (for non-final fields), equals, hashcode, and a required arguments constructor all with a single ""@data"" annotation: https://projectlombok.org/features/Data.htmlI love writing less code.";;
I think the main reason for getters and setters is that instead of modifying the variable directly, you use a method that is easier to follow in the stacktrace once things go wrong. But I do agree that it sort of feels silly and more like a makeshift workaround. ;;
"*In theory*, it allows you to separate your public interface from implementation detail, but I honestly don't find that argument that compelling in classes with a lot of setters. Imagine having a setter called `setFoo` and then suddenly you have to change the detail of your class so that it doesn't have the member `foo` anymore, or `foo` is of a different type. Suddenly you have a setter that is contrary to virtually all the other setters out there. You can always create a new setter and start deprecating the old one, but I think the bottom line is that as long as you have setters, your class's inner details are already exposed. To some extent, this is true to with getter as well.Having a setter allows an extra layer of indirection where you can *perhaps* bridge the implementation detail of the old one and the new one, but I'm personally doubtful of how well it works in practice. Do these setters ever get changed in your experience?I think the point is not to just blindly create some private members and putting getters and setters for all of them. Rather, I think the point has always been, first, to hide the implementation detail of your class by making your class members private, and second, to prevent them from being exposed as much as possible by preferably introducing no setter at all, and only introduce the getters that make sense in the context of your class. See how `ArrayList` has essentially no setter and getter because it only needs to implement the methods corresponding to the interface `List` to logically make sense and be useful.EDIT:To prevent ambiguity, I should note here that by ""setter"" and ""getter"", I'm referring to the methods that have a one-to-one correspondence with the members of some class, as it seems to be common practice to just make member fields private and then blindly boilerplate setters and getters for all of them.";;
"In C# the whole purpose of properties is to make it feel like you're manipulating or reading a public member.  Is:    public int Foo { get; set; }Really that much more effort than this?    public int Foo;Without having to repeat others too much, consider a purely computed field:    public int Total    {        get        {            return Accounts.Sum(account => account.Balance);        }    }Or what if you want to flag that a variable has been changed?    private bool _nameChanged;    private string _name;    public string Name    {        get { return _name; }        set        {            _nameChanged = true;            _name = value;        }    }It's a lot more consistent to use a single strategy to interface with member variables.  I think the relatively minor investment of typing out ""get"" and ""set"" after your variable declaration is worth not having to worry about making sure everybody who uses those variables behaves in synchronization sometime later down the line.I know this is not as easy and is far more time consuming in Java, but many of the IDEs you stated make transitioning to a property / gettersetter method easier will also automatically generate getter / setter methods for you so I still don't see how this is really that big of a deal when the only thing you will accomplish by not doing it is to save yourself a couple of keystrokes.";;
"in c# there tends to be a strong distinction between variables with public getters or setters, which we call properties, and private variables which we call fields.if it's publicly accessible, the value is a property of the object; it tells us something about the object. if it's not publicly accessible, then it's just a value we're holding for work behind the scenes.theoretically, you know when you reference class.Property that it's just a value and you're not doing anything that will change the state of the object. whereas when you call class.Function() you can assume that you're actually doing work.the get/set system in c# allows you to do things more quickly in some cases:    public string Name { get; private set; }vs.    private string name;    public string GetName() { return this.name; }it also allows, in my opinion, for better organization of your code. everything related to just getting or setting a value can be defined in one place rather than having variables and functions that can be put wherever.in the end though, it's just a tool in the language like anything else.i just wish microsoft would add some better built-in support for mvvm. i'm pretty sick and tired of having hundreds of these types of things in my code:    private string name;    public string Name    {      get      {        return this.name;      }      set      {        if (this.name == value)        {          return;        }        this.name = value;        this.RaisePropertyChange();      }    }";;
It's just part of Good Practice^TM and you're right, sometimes it does seem like a lot of boilerplate for little gain.  In fact, in one of my personal Java projects I have core data objects that are nothing more than collections of public fields for exactly the reasons you've described.  But--these objects are just dumb data containers and aren't meant to provide any abstraction whatsoever.Most of the time, our class is an abstraction for something.  It may not be a very strong or interesting abstraction, but conceptually we like to say that a `Person` is a type with a name, age, etc., not just a wrapper on a `String`, `int`, etc.  Sure, we're almost certainly implementing the name as a `String`, but by going through methods instead of accessing the guts directly, we're presenting this `Person` type slightly more abstractly.When someone needs to know your name, they have to ask you for it.  They can't just rip it out of your soul.;;
If a good practice doesn't give benefits it's not a good practice.;;
In this case, however, there are benefits.For example, if you use a private field for distance_in_km you can have two getters, one that returns the value directly and another that first converts to miles and then returns the value.This means that you won't have to do any conversions later and it means that you don't need to maintain two very similar fields wherever one of them is altered.;;
"My very limited experience with the {get; set; } has been that I dislike it. I got a feeling it is because I have misunderstood their usage.I feel I exposed a local variable with the only gain being slightly ""easier"" access in terms of typing for it, but at the loss of removing validation on the ""set"" part, as well as suddenly data is now accessed sometimes via methodes () ending and sometimes just direct on the ""value"".I tried doing a little search back when I first found this option, and I have yet to find something compelling of what the advantage is (beside slightly less typing). If someone got a link for why this is the God's gift to programmers, do share it.";;
"You can add validation in C#'s setter methods like in this example.    private string firstName;    public String FirstName    {        get        {            return firstName;        }        set        {            // validate the input            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))            {                // throw exception, or do whatever            }            firstName = value;        }    }Writing just ``public string FirstName { get; set; }`` is just a short way of writing this:    private string firstName;    public String FirstName    {        get        {            return firstName;        }        set        {            firstName = value;        }    }As far as whether or not this is better than using methods for setting and getting values, well, it's just less typing, doing it the java way will yield the same results.It's also a nice way of grouping the getter and the setter for one value together in one code block, as opposed to doing it in separate methods.";;
"Another positive I didn't see mentioned (I only skimmed) is that you can have multiple getters or setters based on your needs.Example: Say you have a Vector type object (mathematical). You could have getters for different things, one of which you pick as the ""default getter"":* getNormalized : returns a normalized version of the vector* getAsInt: returns the vector rounded to the closest int (for say grid-based implementation)* getOpposite : returns the vector that points in the opposite directionWhile typically these are thought of as methods.. they're still getters since you don't want to change the original data.. so depending on your data types and code structure, it may be best to have these in mind.Another example: You may want to store your data as floats, but only ever return the values as ints, so your getter would be converting or casting every time.";;
Mocking!;;
To add my 2 cents , getters and setters may not be wanted. Most of the time , I will program my constructors to default the value of the class members and not allow any data to interface..;;
"What I've learned from experience is that it's good for contract programming (interfaces) where attributes aren't part of the spec, but only methods are. Also, it lets you perform tasks on data upon setting and getting (I've always preferred mutating and accessing...mutators and accessors...vs getters and setters). For example, I might have an attribute where the data is always stored encrypted. I can wrap that functionality in the setter, and then seamlessly decrypt it with the getter.You might say ""well, just use them for those methods"" well, then you have an inconsistencies.";;
I'm learning Python after Java, and one of Python's neat features is the ability to define class methods that basically intercept any attempt to get, set, or delete any instance variable in that class. It's saved my bacon more than a few times.;;
In object oriented programming it's for encapsulation. You use setters as public methods to set private attributes in the object after it has been instantiated. The object then uses it's own validation to ensure the value each setter receives is valid.Getters are public methods to get the value of variables from the object.;;
Dude, you can put CODE inside of getters and setters!;;
You can put code *everywhere*...;;
"Copied from https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3aks91/why_do_i_really_need_setters_and_getters_do_they/> Well, there are a few cases where it's useful to have public setters and getters for private variables.>> 1. You don't want code importing yours to be able to put unsafe values into your variables.> 2. You need an explicit type in a non-type checked language.> 3. Something HAS to occur when a variable is updated. Maybe you update a database with the new value, or you translate the value itself. (i.e.: set_var1(int x) { this.var1 = x*2; })> 4. For getters, maybe you need to sanitize the values before returning them or some other translation.> 5. Maybe you never intend for a variable to need any of these protections, but then the unthinkable happens and you need to. Any code that used an old version of your code will need to update all occurrences of a variable update with the new setter method. If you include setters from the start then the only modifications that occur are on your side.";;
)'z;;
"I think the key is just to make getters and setters easier to create and manage. Objective-C does this with `@property`, which makes getters and setters for you, based on a standard naming system. If you want to override the defaults, you can make them by hand.It may seem like a prissy model that only exists in order to conform to strict OO design, but I think the nature of objects as mutating themselves is something you want to try to preserve up and down the line, if not for any other reason than basic consistency.Sure, you might argue that it's not very important in some situations. But then again, we'd absolutely insist on separation of concerns in plenty of other cases, wouldn't we? The bottom line is that we don't want objects changing each other. We want objects asking other objects to change themselves. We should be able to assume that this is the model, through-and-through. And creating getters/setters is part of that.TL;DR: Don't get rid of getters and setters, just make them easier to implement with sugary language features like Objective-C's `@property`.";;
"For most cases, it's pointless, but if something changes, you can easily change the getter/setter without changing the API.  You can dynamically do things when a value is get or set.* For setters, it let's you do sanity checks that the user is using it correctly.  Say you have an interest application and by law you can't charge more than 8% interest.  You can check this in the set method and ""do something"" if users enters bad value (throw exception, log error, default to highest legal value, etc).  Not possible with global variables.* For getters, instead of storing a value, you can do a calculation on the fly.  This is nice because you ensure that you always have the most up to date value and don't have to worry about everything that can change it's state.  Just re-calcualte when user requests value.  For example, you want to calculate your reminding mortgage payoff amount.  This has a lot of variables (payments, interest, start date of loan, term, etc).  If any of these values change you don't carry though, since you just re-calculate using the current values (which should be up to date)* It makes serialization a lot ""simpler"" in some APIs.  I have a JSON library that can convert java object to Json and visa-versa, but requires that all variables have properly named getter/setters.  Maybe this is a hack, but makes my life a lot easier.* In theory, most IDE shoudl auto create getters/setters for you and compilers should inline simple getters/setters.  So in theory, it's almost 0 cost in terms of development and performance time.* You can provide multiple getters/setters depending on your needs.  For example, you could have an application that logs temperature but provides getters/setters for celsius, fahrenheit, and kelvin.  Internally you can store it however you want and user can use methods for whatever they are working with and everything ""just works""";;
"Uhm... So a lot of people use getters, setters or property methods for no reason I guess?Data structures and algorithms is all code is, guys :)I don't perform vast optimizations on my code, and I'm not sure there's a point in trying in C# or Java considering memory control is a massive factor in hardcore optimizing...But I at least make sure to know what I'm missing out on.In the case of making one library communicate with another, you often end up with a binary format.  Fields tend to have a direct reference to assign a value to, whereas methods are a subroutine that gets invoked with a state context.That forms an interface, often even a binary interface.So if you modify the field description in any way (size, name, method or field), you end up modifying the interface.  Methods are ""more"" mutable because a method is just an endpoint that describes the I and O parts of IPO (input, processing, output).The implementation is kept ""secret"" and handles processing.  So they provide that level of flexibility.You can ultimately make a method accept ""anything"" and output ""anything"", with some computational restrictions depending on your language or environment, so ultimately they've a very flexible solution.But once again, they're also part of your interface.  That interface is one way to define externally available operations of a utility...  It can break.  It probably will, no matter what the crazy Java philosophy is.";;
>why DO we go through all of the hassle and boilerplate of wrapping private variables with public getters and settersCargo cult programming. You were taught that way, so you keep doing it that way and teaching others that way.   It's not until 15 years later when you actually think about why you are doing what you are doing that you realize maybe something is amiss.;;
Do you feel the same about global variables?If a class is a mini program (it is) then a public field is a global. Anyone can change it at any time and break the assumptions you've built into your methods.Even if *you* put lots of checks to ensure that x != 0, others might not be so diligent. Now your class is throwing DivideByZeroExceptions everywhere and it's going to cost you a day in the debugger to track it down.;;
A class isn't a mini program, it's a blueprint for an object.  A global variable is independent of any other object.Private variables with getter and setter that do nothing are just the same as public variables. Although an advantage of the getter and setter (in other languages anyway, not sure about Java) is that you can later change your setter without breaking code that's already compiled against the same interface.;;
The thing is: this doesn't apply to >90% of the getters and setters you'll come across. There is a fuckton of public getSomeShit(){return SomeShit;} in a lot of corporate Java code, just because people heard they should do it that way, even though they don't have a clue why the fuck they're doing it. Case in point: OP.;
Because Java doesn't have C# style properties, inserting a check (like the x = 0 one above) would require refactoring that an automatic tool couldn't do.If your interface to change x was a method to begin with, inserting the check is one local change. No need to find every time x was assigned and replace it with a method.It's ugly boilerplate, yes, but it serves a purpose. This is why C# uses properties instead - the syntax is 100 times cleaner.;;
You could also just add a bash alias so it doesn't happen every time you spawn a terminal, but you don't have to remember paths.;;
These are the kinda things that are often very specific to the project or individual, however, bash/batch scripts are very powerful if you know how to use them.

Very true.  I took a class on Linux systems/utils and we covered some basic scripting in bash, zsh, etc.  I've been spending some time trying to get more comfortable at it because it is very powerful.  Although, I've yet to find a go-to Bash guide.  I usually just stick with Ruby because I'm much more comfortable with it. I have a lot of respect for system admins because of how difficult good scripts can be to write. ;;

"A module is a place to gather related subs or functions.  A function is a Sub that gives back (returns) a value requested (called) by another piece of code.Go ahead and post the code and the error, someone will share some insight.But, if you are looking for longer examples than MSDN, You could Google search with ""VBA Word"" as part the search term.  I see you are using Visual Studio, and there is a difference between Visual Basic for Applications and the Visual Basic.NET in Visual Studio, but, many of the examples of Word/Excel/Access code show up using the VBA.  In general, they can be helpful for understanding the workings of the MS Office environment.   Just be aware that VBA code has a few differences to VB.NET code for Office.";;
*array[i+1]* accesses the *i+1*th element of the array.*array[i] + 1* accesses the *i*th element of the array and adds 1 to it.;;
You evaluate what's in the square brackets first, then the variable and finally do the addition.So     array[6+7] + 1becomes...    array[13] + 1Which is then evaluated. So if the 13th element in the array was 54 you'd have....    54 + 1    55;;
Imagine I have an array with five elements. The five elements are 1,2,3,4,5. Arrays are zero-indexed, so array[0] would mean the first element, array[1] the second, etc. If I say array[i+1], I'm asking for the element at index i+1. So, if i=2, I want array[3] (which is 4 in my example array). If I say array[2]+1, I mean take array[2], and add 1 to it. In my example, array[2] is 3, and 3 + 1 = 4. Note: array[i+1] usually won't be equal to array[i]+1, it's just my example data.;;
Well, it looks like you're calling `UpdateStatus()`, which is expecting an object of type `Class1` as an argument, but you're giving it an object array. So that's your problem. You're going to need to replace `new object[] { e.EventMessage }` with something like `new Class1 { /* code to initialize the members of Class1 */ }`As an aside, Try not to use names like `Class1`. It just makes the code super hard to read because it's not descriptive at all.;;
thanks. yea that's my bad, everything else has a meaningful name i just kinda dropped the ball on the one, got lazy.;;
Some random thoughts about it:* Why are you using a regex to check whether the input is valid?  You could just tryParse `text` and then check whether the result is non-negative.* All of your branches in `taskFunc` start by doing the same thing, so you can move it out of the conditional block.* It looks to me like the common logic of the `{fizz,buzz,fizzbuzz}Func` functions can be factored out fairly easily.* The way you're using `y` looks suspect.  I'd just make it a local variable of `taskFunc` and check whether to display anything using something else.* Ending your functions with `Func` is redundant.;;
Try reducing the code with the fact that 15 gives FizzBuzz because it both is a multiple of 3 and 5.;;
A quick note about the if statement in your `taskFunc` method.Suppose we're describing instructions on how you're going to get dressed for the day depending on the weather. We might have an if-statement that looks like    if(very cold outside){        put on underwear        put on thick pants and heavy jacket    }     else if(very hot outside){        put on underwear        put on shorts and a t-shirt    }    else{        put on underwear        put on whatever else you feel like    }Notice how we've stated you should put on underwear regardless of the weather (which may differ from your life choices, but we won't go into that :P). Since we want that to happen regardless of the weather condition, that should be extracted from the if statement to avoid repeating ourself.    put on underwear    if(very cold outside){        put on thick pants and heavy jacket    }    else if(very hot outside){        put on shorts and a t-shirt    }    else{        put on whatever else you feel like    }This is an important not only because it's clear that putting on the underwear will happen no matter what, there's no chance of us forgetting to put on underwear if we happen to add an additional else-if clause.See if you can find what I'm addressing in your source. Good luck!;;

It's not safe, because the compiler is going to have emit code that reads the 64-bit number, does bitwise operations on it to access the individual bytes, and then writes the result back - the reads and writes by the various threads can occur in any order.Of course, if you actually want to access 64 bits of memory in a  bytewise manner, the obvious data structure to use is an array of char, in which case the access to each byte would be thread-safe.;;
"No, you can't do that.  Any time you have multiple threads operating on the same object, you need some kind of lock or mutex to ensure that only one of them is ever accessing it at once.If instead of a single 8 byte `long long`, you had an array of 8 chars, then it would be safe for threads to access individual chars without locks, as long as no two threads attempt to access the same chars.  That's because in that case there are 8 different objects, not one object.  The code that compiler generates is different in the two cases.  If you tell the compiler that there's a single `long long` object, it's going to generate code that accesses it as a whole; there's no valid way to tell it just to access a portion of that object.Edit: and by ""no valid way"", I mean even if you try to write bitmasking code that logically appears to only read or write a part of the `long long`, the compiler is still within its rights to transform that into something that reads and writes the entire object in a thread-unsafe manner (e.g. without barriers or synchronization.)";;
"Maybe, maybe not.  This depends on the language you're working in, and if that doesn't guarantee what happens (in which case you shouldn't do it!), on the implementation and the architecture.There's a few things to note here.What do you mean by ""use and/or modify""?  Are you assuming that they perform a single atomic operation?  Your phrasing suggests that there are four operations that may be reordered (giving 4! possible orders), but your question suggests that thread A may read bytes 1-2 before thread B reads bytes 3-4, and then write them after thread B writes.Secondly, what do you mean by ""use and/or modify **bytes 1-2**""?  Are you saying that you will make a pointer to those bytes and perform all reads and writes through that pointer?  Or are you just saying you'll be using bitops that only affect the lower two bytes (then why isn't `foo` unsigned)?Thirdly, what do you mean by ""first copy it, then do something, and finally copy it back""?  On an x86 processor, actual work is going to happen in registers.  That's not a matter of threading, it's it's just how the computation model generally works.  Are you asking about copying that may happen above that?  Thread-specific caches?";;
No, this is unsafe. The compiler will generate code to work with the 64 bit value.  You need interlocked operations if they exist for the modifications you need. Or you need a full lock.  Or you need to restructure your data.;;
It is possible but it will not be built into any language. You will need to write some kind of thread safe manager to ensure safe access and sync of the final resulting byte array. ;;
> Can multiple threads operate on a single 64 bit int at the same time if they each use different bytes? Yes, of course you can. The computer doesn't care if you treat that as 1 64-bit value or 8 8-bit values, or some other subdivision, but that can possibly be constrained by memory alignment issues and you need to be aware of the endianness of the compute, that you're maintaining meaningful bit patterns for `foo`'s type (2's complement signed integer? IEEE 754 float?), the fact that it might not be performant because the CPU is operating on word-sized chunks anyway, so on and so forth.You can do this by having each thread a pointer to a 2 byte type at the appropriate location in `foo`. It's also routinely done in languages like C using a `union`. This is very common in the Win32 API. For instance, here's one for doing [exactly what you're talking about](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383713%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) (e.g. addressing parts of a multi-byte integer independently).;;
"So...have you tried it?> My confusion comes from not understanding whether the threads operate directly on the data or if they first copy it, then do something, and finally copy it back.They do whatever you tell them to do. Did you write a temp variable? Then it uses one. The code you write in a threaded function works the same way it does anywhere else. So the question becomes, when you write *any* code that modifies data, does the machine modify the data ""directly"" or not. (Do you know the answer(s) to that?) Then you simply (!) add the hiccup of instructions occurring in no particular order.";;
Trying it may not show a problem .. Synchronisation problems usually show up the day after delivery to the customer.Your 2nd statement isn't true either .. A compiler will do all sorts of optimisations.  You need to look at the disassembly to see exactly when reads and writes are done.;;
"Yes, because this person is obviously writing a large threaded application for a customer and that is the appropriate context for answering the question.

">  the problem would show up more or less instantlyThat is not true.  It might,  or it might not.  If you suspect a concurrency problem you cannot prove your code right with a test,  the best you can hope for is that you prove it wrong quickly.> disagreement with what I wrote> Did you write a temp variable? Then it uses one.You cannot assume that the compiler will use any temporary storage.  As long as the program behaves as if there was a temp,  it doesn't matter if there was one.What looks like a single access     i*=30;could compile to 0, 1, 2 or many accesses  (the compiler may not use a multiply instruction,  it may do a set of shifts and/or additions).";;
I write software for a company with a massive customer base and I still post 'basic' questions here. Programming is a continuous learning cycle, only liars or inflated egos will say they have nothing left to learn.Async issues are one of the worse things there are. Often impossible to replicate easily as even at a low level, you as a programmer, have very little to no control over the order threaded applications run in. That's all up to the OS' scheduler.Even unit tests fail at testing threaded operations. The best you can do is fake situations where threaded issues might occur, but guess what, all that test will tell you is: program defensively when using threads. The best thing to do is be as safe as possible when it comes to threads. Everything accessed across threads need some kind of lock, mutex, queue, etc.As for the temp var thing... That's not what they meant. They mean how does the CPU operate on a 64 bit value when you only access some of the bits. Which, in terms of machine code, -does- take a copy (of the entire 64 bits), edit the specified ones, then set the entire 64 bits back, which makes it unsafe, two threads reading and writing the entire 64 bits, regardless of what bits they are, will cause issues. Thread A reads 0b0000, Thread B reads 0b0000, Thread A writes 0b0011, Thread B writes 0b1100, expected value to developer is 0b1111, actual value will be 0b1100 as Thread B was not aware of Thread A's write at the time it read.;;
">I write software for a company with a massive customer base and I still post 'basic' questions here.

That's why I read the OP and made the judgement call - I could be wrong - that they are a beginner in the topic.>... Even unit tests fail at testing threaded operations...Yes, it was a mistake of me to use the word ""test"", which in the year 2015 means something different than what I'm used to, if it means anything at all. It was an oversight on my part and I can understand why some of the argument seems to be at cross purposes. So I will try to be more clear. My initial statement was ""did you try it"" - there is a reason most non-Java schools begin with a REPL language, after all. Hands on work improves understanding. Obviously C/C++ does not have a REPL (without getting crazy, anyway), but the sentiment was supposed to be: throw shit around and see what happens, not *write a unit test you probably won't understand for code you definitely don't understand and assume everything is good*. Even still, I'm having trouble understanding how people are reading my post and assuming I meant the insane interpretation.>As for the temp var thing... That's not what they meant.

To me it sounded as if OP thought threads *might* operate on a higher logical layer than ""regular"" code. (ie before we even get down to the CPU.) It's all just ""regular"" code (for C/C++), which is what I tried to convey, assuming OP had a grasp on what happens to ""regular"" code. I suppose that was a mistake too.

"> Full Stack Web Development, reason being I enjoy front end as well as back end. Java Mobile Development (iOS & Android)This is a fine plan. You'll likely find (unless something weird changes) that Java isn't super useful for iOS development (for that you'll want either Objective-C or Swift), but it'll be fine in many other cases.If I can suggest getting even more granular:1. HTML - Get your content on the page2. CSS - Get your content to where it looks good (or at least reasonably good) on devices of varying widths. This includes phones.3. Javascript (DOM manipulation -- adding and removing elements from a page, showing/hiding elements, etc.)4. Some back end framework (this can be in Java, Javascript, or another language -- I use Ruby and Rails professionally, but again, there are lots of options)5. Here's where you can pick -- maybe you dig harder into either iOS or Android development. Maybe you continue being a full stack developer. Maybe you do both/all of those things.It's not wrong to want to do lots of things. Just make sure you're only doing one thing at a time.

This is going to teach you how to break up your application into smaller, reusable chunks as well as dive into some higher abstract concepts like lambdas and dependency injection.If you're a CS major, or even if you just like doing statistical analysis you might try the R programming language - this is another language that's going to mess with your head a bit to learn at first.While, like Barrucadu stated, SQL isn't a programming language - you might pick up a database like Postgres or SQL Server and learn PL/SQL or T-SQL - these are extensions to the SQL standard that allow you to write conditional statements, declare variables, write functions, etc. Database development is some of the most rewarding learning, I think, a young developer can do. It has some really good gratification qualities to it, and there's nothing like building your first database, attaching an application to it, and being able to witness data being manipulated and transferred into information delivered by your application.;;
"Haskell, Erlang, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, F#, ... and the likes encompass functional programming. In FP, you have to work with values being immutable, with functions as the sole means of code organization, without Smalltalk/Java-like classes or objects, with seperation of I/O from ""normal"" execution and so forth. Haskell is the purest / most strict implementation of the lambda calculus, the underlying principle of functional programming.Prolog is the prime example for logical programming. The underlying principle is predicate/first-order logic. If you actually want to learn it, I'd suggest to combine it with automata theory and language processing.Rust is a newer language that doesn't resemble a special paradigm, but introduces ownership, a concept worth mentioning since I don't know of any other language that has this.";;
SQL *is* Turing complete, but it's not really a programming language in the sense that the others you named are. It's certainly useful to know if you ever want to work with databases, but it's probably not as eye-opening as learning Haskell or Scheme would be.;;
If you're a beginner pick a decent starter language (read the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq)), do enough tutorials to get the basics down and then build a LOT of software. At your level you really should not think about switching between languages let alone one with a completely different paradigm. ;;

I guess I'm doing it like this:          #define kernel(a)    (0x0000<=a && a<0x1000)?1:0          #define shared_ram(a)(0x1000<=a && a<0x4000)?1:0Do you think that's a good way of doing it or does it come across as unnecessarily complicated and forced? ;;
"If you are going to use a macro, do it properly:        #define kernel(a)    ((0x0000<=(a) && (a)<0x1000)?1:0)which will save all sorts of problems if a is an expression, rather than a simple value. You could of course also simply say:        #define kernel(a)    ((0x0000<=(a) && (a)<0x1000))or use a function instead:       int kernel(unsigned int a)    { return 0x0000 <= a && a < 0x1000; }";;
There is literally no reason for the `?1:0` part. The result of the comparison `(0x0000<=a && a<0x1000)` will be 1&nbsp;or&nbsp;0 already.
"I think this:    #define isKernel(a)    (a>=0x0000 && a<0x1000)?1:0is better than this:    #define kernel(a)       (0x0000<=a && a<0x1000)?1:0Actually it's the same, but the first is more readable. Furthermore, the ""is"" prefix suggests that you can obtain either true (1) or false (0).You could even directly write:    #define isKernel(a)    (a<0x1000)?1:0since no address can be less than 0x0000, but here there isn't any error control, hence if you pass a (wrong) negative address, you obtain 1.";;
The domain name is not changing — that would be impossible.  The path portion of the URL is.  That can be changed dynamically in JavaScript using the [HTML5 history APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).  This is the basis of how so-called single page apps work.  When you click on something in such an app, it's as if you browsed to a new URL, but instead of that actually happening, JavaScript just changes the page content and the URL without actually reloading anything.  Highly dynamic sites use this technique because they tend to load a buttload of JS and this prevents having to reload all of it on every page.  The site becomes a continuously running JavaScript program that can maintain state between pages, rather than the traditional model where everything is torn down and reset when you load a new page and any scripting has to start over from nothing.;;
The domain name is a 'name' alias for an IP adress. It won't change. What is changing is the window.location or URL. And that's something you can easily do in JavaScript. When you scroll there's a script that recieves the scroll requests. It simply checks which article is visible at that moment and changes the URL. ;;
"As other have said - not the domain name but the path is changed.This can be done with [pushState()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history#The_pushState\(\)_method)For example:    window.history.pushState('an object or string', 'Title', '/new/path/here');";;
Are you talking about Java interfaces?;;
Sorry no, I working with C# in .NET;;
"I'm gonna try and explain C#'s interfaces as best I can.Interfaces only contain the *signatures* of methods and properties, not their actual implementations (= bodies)    public interface IMyInterface // you don't have to but you'll want to prefix your interface names with 'I'    {        bool SomeBoolean { get; set; }        // this is a property with bodiless getter and setter        string GetString();        void DoThing(int argument);       // only the signature, no body    }Note that the signatures cannot have access modifiers, but can have access specifiers, such as `protected` or `internal`.When creating a class, you can derive from as many interfaces as you want. The only condition is that you must give implementations to the interface's methods and properties. I like treating interface inheriting as saying ""I promise to provide some kind of implementation for these methods and properties.""    public class MyClass : IMyInterface    {        public bool SomeBoolean        {            get { return _someBoolean; }            set { _someBoolean = value; }        }        bool _someBoolean = true;        public string GetString()        {            return ""Hello World!"";        }        public void DoThing()        {            Console.WriteLine(""Doing thing"");        }    }As the interface doesn't define any access modifiers, your implementations must always be `public` (with any access specifiers defined in the interface added).Somewhere else in your code, you can use interfaces as types for your objects.    IMyInterface _myObject = new MyClass();Now that you have an object of type `IMyInterface`, you can use the properties and methods the interface has and be sure they'll have some sort of implementation.    Console.WriteLine(_myObject.GetString());    Console.WriteLine(_myObject.SomeBoolean);    _myObject.DoThing();        >Hello World!    >True    >Doing thingThis is just the basic use of interfaces, I'm not gonna go into the depths of them now. You can read more about them [over here.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173156.aspx)";;
That gives me a little bit more of an understanding, lets take below for example I can do this question easily enough, but I don't understand where would an interface come in this example. I presume you implement it in the base class Patient, then all classes will inherit the interface.. but why do I need it for this question?**Question 2 - 35 Marks**A local hospital called “XYZ Hospital” has requested a software company to develop an information system for the hospital. As a part of the software team, you are required to write the following classes, interfaces etc. in C#.**a) An Address class the with following specification:** House number (property) Street (property) City (property) A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).(5 marks)**b) A Patient class with the following specifications:** PatientId (property) PatientName (property) PatientAddress (property) – use already created Address class. PatientType (property) – can be public or private A constructor that uses all the properties A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).(5 marks)**c) An OutPatient class extends the Patient class with following properties** VisitDate VisitNo A constructor with all properties A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).(7 marks)**d) A ResidentPatient class that extends the Patient class** AdmissionDate DischargeDate RoomNo A constructor with all properties A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).**Write a test class to create two objects, one of type OutPatient and one of type ResidentPatient and display their details.**(7 marks);;
Even though the question says to write the following classes, interfaces etc, nowhere there it actually requires you to use interfaces. `Address`, `Patient`, `OutPatient` and `ResidentPatient` must be classes, because they all require you to override `ToString()`, which interfaces cannot do.;;
Thats the way I was doing it, over riding the ToString method for each class and I was racking my brain trying to figure out how an interface fits into this scenario. Do you know why they would have put that into the exam paper then?;;
Maybe they give the same task for all questions, even though not all of them require interfaces. Or maybe they're trying to confuse you.;;
* a) An Address class* b) A Patient class * etcThe exam specifically requires you only make classes. The first line must be the same in other exams.;;
There is no more mention of Interfaces in that exam, or previous exam papers, I think what /u/Backplague said was right, just trying to confuse you and throw you off the scent. ;;
"You're reading too much into the wording. These use-cases don't really have much use for interfaces. You'd typically want to have an interface somewhere where you're providing an API and expect 'someone else' to create an actual implementation. In this case your library might provide a ""PatientDatabase"" interface with a ""getPatientByName();"" method. You'd expect someone else to provide an actual implementation because that's beyond the scope of the project.Another benefit of using interfaces over concrete classes in this scenario is testing: if you want to unit test ""patient"" functionality without having to connect to an actual database you could provide a mock implementation of the ""PatientDatabase""  interface just for testing.";;
I thought I put together a pretty good use case in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3blo7x/z/csncaxu);;
Love it, great example for me and well put. if possible could you give me a real world example in plain English? Like an Application, website, internal system.. etc. Where they would implement an Interface into their project? ;;
Check out the core C# interfaces:* IEnumerable - arrays, lists, queues. your implementation only cares what the next thing is, not how it's stored.* IDisposable - resources that have manageable lifetimes. Your implementation doesn't care if it's a file, database or a TCP stream - just make sure it's closed when you're done.Interfaces are just contracts between objects. It's a super abstracted form of polymorphism - interact with an object by what it *does*, not what it *is*.;;

"For beginners switching between similar languages (and that's what C#, Python, Java and JavaScript are) is a waste of time because it's exactly that; a timesink. Such context switches slow you down a lot and don't really teach you anything. A for loop is just a for loop in any language, switching beween Java and Python isn't going to change that, it's just the syntax that's slightly different.Only when you get at a level where you are confident that you can build almost anything in <language you picked> you should consider trying languages with a different paradigm (functional languages like Haskell, Logical language like Prolog) because these 'shifts' actually do make you a better and more well rounded developer. For example my experience with functional programming makes using lambda's in for example Java feel very natural. ";;
One project I worked on a couple years ago used about 7 different languages in its code.  Different languages have strengths and weaknesses and are used for different things.  But *all* of them revolve around similar concepts.  Once you know one or two pretty well, learning another isn't actually all that hard.That said, if you do want to branch out I recommend picking a language from a different category altogether.  In fact, I generally recommend that you *eventually* learn at least one language from the following groups:* Low-level/systems programming: C, C++, Rust, assembly, etc.* Applications: Java, C#, C++, etc.* Scripting: Python, Perl, Ruby, Shell scripts, etc.* Web:  JavaScript, PHP, etc.* Other: this includes functional programming languages, esoteric languages, etc.  Anything that isn't really used in the professional world but still teach important concepts.;;

I think you have a typo there.Never fear young whipper snapper. The first distinction to be made is that you're not looking to make games, but rather attempting to learn how 3D graphics, at the core, are rendered and manipulated on a computer.If you're simply looking to make games, there are more tutorial-based, non-theoretical approaches. They'll use things like Unity to get you started, and show you basic math - enough to make things work.But where's the fun in that.

To get started, sure. But the reason I asked was mainly to see what you could do with C and version control. If you want to work on shared projects, you need to be able to handle git (or some other version control system).When you have time, make a repo of your own, push some code, make some changes, etc. Play with it. Should be frustrating but fun.;;
Thanks, will do. ;;
Your answer is correct, but interestingly enough your solution is not. You misread the problem and are very lucky it prints the correct number.;;
Lol. Is there a way i can view the correct solution ?;;
Officially, the website asks users not to post solutions online. Unofficially, there are hundreds of websites that post them, which is why I didn't mind asking you to post one: anyone with google can find a solution in their favourite programming language.;;
"Is this correct, i changed the loop's condition.    #include <stdio.h>        #define INITIAL_TERM 1        int main(void) {        	printf (""Finding the sum of the even-valued terms in a Fibonacci series while not exceeding four-million "");    	    	unsigned int count = 0;    	unsigned int prev1 = INITIAL_TERM;    	unsigned int prev2 = INITIAL_TERM;    	unsigned int next = 0;    	    	while (next < 4000000) {    		    		next = prev1 + prev2;    		prev1 = prev2;    		prev2 = next;    		    		if ((next % 2) == 0) {    			    			count = count + next;    		}	    	}         	printf(""The sum of the even numbers is %u. "", count);        return 0;        }";;
A lot better, but still one small issue that could cause trouble. How do you know that the last `next` value you add to `count` is below the limit?;;
"I'm not sure how much of the ""basics"" you've learned. Do you understand pointers? Managing your memory? Using a debugger? Which isn't tied solely to C but it helps a lot.I suggest figuring out what interests you. You could make a graphics renderer, sudoku solver, chess AI. Go through the list of data structures on Wikipedia and make implementations of them. Eventually you'll need to learn concepts not tied to C but are low level so they're generally implemented in C/C++.";;
Unless you're using recursion you don't need to worry. Even then there's optimizations that turn recursive functions into for/while loops.It'd be better to print to a document instead of to the console because consoles are usually limited to showing only a certain amount of lines at one time.;;
So I won't have to worry about my computer overheating or printing a hundred thousand combinations?;;
Provided it has sufficient cooling. Avoiding printing a hundred thousand combinations depends on your implementation.;;
Basically anything you're going to do with Java (and most languages, really) will have zero negative effect on your computer;;
Likely printing to a document (e.g. using `PrintWriter` or one of Java's other file IO classes) will be way faster than printing to the screen.In my experience, directly printing to a file is also faster than writing a program that just prints to standard out (e.g. `System.out.println`) and then having standard out be redirected to a file.;;
I don't know of any degree program that focuses on the things you want.Half of the things you're asking about - game development, languages, best practices - change quickly. Some of the most popular programming languages today were barely used at all 10 years ago and they didn't exist 20 years ago. Best practices change too - 15 years ago, most software had custom/one-off testing code if it had any at all, while today it's rare to find software that doesn't use a standard popular unit testing library, mocks, etc. And game development has changed dramatically - 15 years ago it was all about low-level coding, then it moved higher level, then as mobile exploded those low-level skills were needed again.College courses aim to be more universal and longer-lasting than that. They aim to teach the art of programming, the math and science behind it, and the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms that form a foundation to base the rest of your knowledge on.What you should aim to get out of a college degree should be things like:* Object-oriented programming (universal, this applies to virtually any programming language)* Fundamental data structures and algorithms - these are also found in all languages and useful for all problems* Complexity analysis - how to determine the runtime and memory usage of code* Experience with some of the major types of programming languages - for example one each of an assembly language, a compiled language like C or Java, and a dynamically-typed language like Python, plus ideally a functional language too. Even if you never use these languages, you'll know all of the major types of language so learning a new one will be easy.What you shouldn't expect to learn:* Software development as it's done in industry - first of all, your professors haven't been in industry in a while so they don't know, but it changes too quickly anyway - and it varies a lot depending on what type of company you work for and what type of project you work on.* Specific programming languages - learning a new language is easy once you know the concepts. A good university should give you one example each of the different types of languages I mentioned above. If you learn Java in school, for example, picking up C# (which is used for a lot of game development) will be super easy, it will take you only a day or two to get productive and you'll have it mastered (as well as you know Java) in a month.* Game development - it's pretty specialized. In college you could learn some of the basics, like an intro to OpenGL, but there are so many types of games and the details are so specific that there aren't many college courses that cover more than the basic intro.As for the rest of the things you want to learn, you'll have a much easier time learning them on your own once you know the fundamentals better. The absolute best way is to learn those on the job.If you don't care about the diploma but want excellent intro C.S. courses, have you considered MIT's open courses?;;
"What do you mean>How do you tell what 30px to the left is?30px to the left is 30px to the left.

Screen density does, but that doesn't affect how far 30px is.";;
Well, that's not entirely true these days, because on a phone or tablet with a decent screen, mobile browsers cheat and make 1 CSS pixel equal to 2 x 2 physical device pixels, otherwise everything would be too hard to read.Plus, users can zoom any web page.;;
You are correct, but I don't think that really affects what OP is asking. Though I don't really get what he's asking.;;
Im asking how big is a pixel? How do developers know where the coordinates of x:100px and y: 100px is? How do developers know where images are placed by just specifying the pixels? How do developers count 30px left? A pixel is really tiny and I don't get how people can count them or estimate them. Sorry if I'm still being unclear;;
Developers are the ones who decide where the images are placed. Pixels are largely irrelevant because most design is done by eye.Using things like CSS you can just place a div 30px over and see if that's the alignment you want.;;

It's all the same regardless of whether you're doing web development or embedded systems development.    Find good general tutorials for each one.

And if mobile development is not for you, you can go for ""hipterish"" web technologies like ruby or angular, as the kind of companies that work with that environment tend to be of the startup type and will care more about your personal projects than about your CV.The general rule I would tell you is: Whatever you pick, use your learning time to create a portfolio of apps.";;
"If you're looking for an entry level job, you won't be expected to know x language flawlessly. I got a job at a mid sized company knowing C, C++, Java, and Python. After my training, I was set up with Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio and instructed to build a website using C#, javascript/jquery, and SQL. You're going to run into a language you don't know at entry level positions.The point to take away from this is to familiarize yourself with the concepts, rather than the syntax. Sure, knowing C++ has a handy std library for vectors and such is nice, but it means nothing when you're expected to implement an interface on 6 methods in a new language without knowing what an interface or contract is. My advice would be to go to different sites for different languages and find the topics that they all have in common. Oracle docs and Cppreference will both have something on, say, lambda functions or garbage recycling/memory management. W3 and jQuery docs will both mention the difference between document height and window height. These are the concepts to learn.Google some of these topics, read up until you think to yourself ""so I could use it in an example like this..."", and implement a small version of it in your favorite relatable language (managing an array in python is very different from handling one in Sql, for example, so choose a more similar language, like Javascript).Other than that, if you want to do Web Development, learn Web dev languages! If you want to make video games, learn C++ or Java! If you want to advertise yourself as cutting-edge to an employer, check out rust! Whatever language floats your boat is the language you should learn.";;
As a follow up, say if I were to come up with an idea of a project I want to build on my own, how would I go about finding out what concepts I should know in order to build the project? This was one of my biggest hurdles before I took my break. ;;
Learn native Android development. Those guys are really wanted at least here in Amsterdam.;;
I'm sure it's possible.No way is it practical.;;
Agreed. There are so many excellent debugging tools in the Java toolchain. Looking at the byte code would be like a carpenter using a microscope to see why a table is not level. I mean sure you could do it, but why?I would imagine one would only look at the bytecode if one was working with the compiler itself, or looking at a deep code optimization or performance issue.;;
Precisely. Any dev who is capable of doing that effectively isn't gonna need to ask guys like me about it, that's for sure. :P;;
The reason I asked was due to an answer left on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22648627/how-java-auto-boxing-unboxing-works);;
At work we do some heavy C# and once in a great while I will check the CIL with ReSharper. It's not to debug, though, it's to check the difference between two algorithms if I profile the code and find a really hot spot and need to heavily optimize it. ;;
The problem with bytecode is that's it is not the final step. The Java Virtual Machine takes that bytecode and, while it's running, compiles it to the actual binary code that your CPU understands. During that compilation stage most of the actual optimization is done.;;
I don't have a degree and am working full time as a software engineer. I got lucky May of last year and kind of stumbled into a contractor spot working for a friend. I was green and had no idea what I was doing. I learned most everything on the job trough trial and error and some how stayed afloat. March of this year I sensed my time was coming to an end so I started looking. I went through about 15 pages of job listings a night looking for spots that I felt I had a chance at obtaining. I compared what they were asking against what I had. If I thought I had a fighting chance, I applied. I put out about 25 or so apps/resumes. Started getting interviews directly. I used the initial interviews to tailor the ones that followed. I wrote out answers to commonly asked questions. I thought about how I could leverage my strengths. And I eventually landed a full time spot with benefits and vacation and all that good stuff. Yea I had some experience but I still only have an associates degree that has nothing to do with software whatsoever.   TL:DRStart putting out applications for things you positions you'd feel comfortable working in. What's the worst that could happen? Worst comes to worst, you've got some experience talking to employers about spots and you have an idea of what they're looking for. ;;
You pretty much need a portfolio though. The code doesn't have to be fantastic, it just has to show your work. Anyone can have a resume full of skills they know, but having a portfolio is a far better judge of actual worth.And about what to put in it... Put anything you want, it doesn't have to be a complete project, an app, a site. When you are browsing the internet and you have an issue, a simple script on github will show a lot.No one ever thinks they are ready in the first job. Just be confident that you know your skill. You will learn a lot more in your first year and anyone worth working for realizes that.;;
You dont need a portfolio. I've never interviewed for a development position and they've asked for a portfolio (I'm in the Southeast US) - the most I've ever had to do is write code on a white board or sheet of paper.My advice for a brand new developer looking to get their foot in the door is to make sure they go to a department where the senior developers are readily available for guidance and mentoring and the company has a healthy training budget. If you get an interview where you never meet the team that you're going to be working with - Run!Itd probably be best to seek employment at a larger company - you'll learn a lot about a lot really fast. That first job that you obtain in the industry is important for your learning, not for salary, position, or status of the company (you'll move onto something better in 2+ years);;
> I've never interviewed for a development position and they've asked for a portfolioIf you want a larger shot of even getting the interview, that's where the portfolio comes in.;;
You may have a point. None of the places I applied even asked for a portfolio up front. The recruiter didn't ask until after the first interview. It all depends though. ;;
Do you have a bachelor's? ;;
Only an associates. ;;
Interesting! Thanks for sharing the details.;;
This must be a regional thing then.  I've worked with different IT recruiting agencies as well, those that make profit from you being hired, and this has also never been instructed of me.  I've honestly never seen or heard of this practice. With Graphic Designers or other art-related fields, or game development fields this is pretty common - but as far as I know for a software engineering position this isn't common in my area.Note: I don't really have a problem with interviews, as far as being nervous or anything - I can rock them.  So for someone that isn't as well off with the social butt-rubbing, a portfolio could be that additional technical contribution that pushes them to get the job - I've just never thought about doing it. ;;
I agree that portfolios can be very valuable tools and I think it is good practice to have one if you do need it for an interview. However, in all of the people I talked to and interviews I did, the only person to ask for a portfolio was a single recruiter. I'm not saying that other people won't benefit from a portfolio, but I really never used mine. ;;
Better to have it and not need it, than not have it and need it.;;
Just like a condom!;;
Need one? No, but the advantages are SOME will want to see, once you get through to the second stage interview.  Having a few completed projects under your belt give you confidence to balance against experience / lack of degree.;;
Yea. When the recruiter asked for my portfolio I kind of freaked. I had a lot of smaller projects but nothing really substantial. And I couldn't really use anything from my contractor spot. Definitely panicked for awhile until I threw something together. ;;
Tactical developer based within a business function of a very large company. I built up everything I know on the job (didn't even know SQL) and whilst I'm confident in my knowledge, I feel at an interview I'd be very crap. Often I don't know the technical terms for what I'm doing until I need to Google / ask another dev' about it. Only recently discovered that I have BIDS - I'd been referring to it as Visual Studio or SSRS.So not ready to move jobs, 5 years later.;;
What is BIDS?;;
I think getting a degree is good but a situation where you have the degree and are unable to defend it makes it seems useless. Have seen many people with degrees who cannot defend it but a lot of guys without it know more because they learning how to code was out of passion not because it was their field of study.;;
It's so troubling to me. I love learning and actually enjoy going to school. But it just seems that 99% of what I work on, I've either learned on the job or in my free time. Very little of what I've learned in school has been needed at work. I won't say it isn't valuable at all, I just feel that if I had spent that time actually writing software and reading documentation, I could be way ahead of where I am now. ;;
This dude is awesome;;
I appreciate that!;;
> What's the worst that could happen?Getting blacklisted because you performed so low. Plot twist: You study hard afterwards, get really up to level, can't apply anymore, you're blacklisted. ;;
I'm not sure if you're fucking with me or not. Blacklisted?;;
Go try? You have very little to lose (some time, gas money) from going on a few interviews.In the mean time, build something you can show off.;;
I would very strongly agree with this.  You really can't know until you go out and try.  There's no downside to giving it a shot and you will learn very quickly what people expect you to know.  You can then take those expectations and put them in a personal project that you can talk about during the interview when they ask you the questions you know they will ask you.;;
+1 on this from me as well. I hire software engineers for a living and some of my best hires have been without degrees. While I won't say that it doesn't matter (usually applicants with CS degrees have better fundamentals and more disciplined code), it's definitely not the first thing I look at and by no means will it be the lone reason to hire or pass on a candidate. I'll look at somebody's github account before I look at the education portion of their resume. I would recommend just just putting yourself out there and try to get some interviews. If your hiring manager is competent, he'll know how to determine if you're a for during the interview process. And even if you're not, you'll have a good idea of how to prepare for the next one. ;;
In small job markets for these type of jobs, you don't always have the luxury of applying to a company when you are not at peak of preparedness though?;;
You could always look into remote-based jobs. Competition for them will probably be tougher and they may not be representative of your local job market, but it's a place to start;;
It's not about what you know or what you could build but what you can actually do. Can you use a repo? Can you write unit tests?Can you get your code to output a UI? (non console) Can you organize your code in a variety of acceptable ways? (n tier) Can you apply a pattern or identify an antipattern? Yes to all? Go to work. You know more than some college grads. Myself included when I graduated. ;;
Reality: Can you write unit tests? Yes. Will you right unit tests? Probably not. ;;
Work on open source projects. That's a great way to build your github profile. Anyone can contribute to an open source project, and there are a ton out there. ;;
A link to a GitHub profile is my favorite thing to see on a resume. If I see that, and I can spend 5 minutes with your code and see that it compiles and doesn't appear to have been written while intoxicated, than that will almost always get you at least a phone interview ;;

Just go try. I feel less than adequate about my programming skills EVEN WITH a degree. I applied to about a hundred jobs, and I only got one call back and got the job. The most important thing is your willingness to learn on the go because as a programmer, especially one that hasn't had a job yet, it's hard to find a job that 'you know what to do'. Also, if you do end up getting a programming. Don't quit on your first day. I was extremely close to quitting on Day 1 because I thought there was no way in hell I was going to be able to do what they asked of me and felt overwhelmed. I'm glad I didn't because I was wrong.;;
"5 years now with the title of ""Programmer"", I've built literally hundreds of sites, applications, services, mobile apps, etc.I still don't feel ""ready""... not in the slightest.I read the title of 10 StackOverflow articles and I feel like I know less than zero.Still, I go into work every week and finish each and every project assigned to me, whether it's something I've ever done before or not.";;
Well, that's obviously not true. You know more than zero - you're making software. That's more than not making software. Humility is nice but don't overdo it.  Sell yourself as you are - a developer that wants to grow. If you knew less than zero, you'd be a drug addict or something counterproductive. ;;

A little off topic but how do you remember your username?;;
If you wanted to remember it without machine aid, you could remember the number for which that username is the binary equivalent.;;
"To provide some Dunning-Kruger balance, I've been programming professionally for something like 11 or 12 years now. I've built like 2 or 3 sites, 0 apps, 0 mobile apps, and I guess like a dozen services.I feel pretty darn ready.When I go to stack overflow and view ""unanswered newest"" for a topic I'm comfortable with (say, for example, ""Java""), I often feel like I can easily answer the question, or if I can't, the problem is that the question is ill-posed rather than due to my lack of knowledge.That said, sometimes I don't finish my projects on time.";;
Based entirely on numbers that seems like next to nothing.

How often in your positions have you had the chance to work with legacy code or do code reviews on other developers around you?You can be a really good developer, but working to try and debug other's code is an art in itself. ;;
About 2 of the past 5 years has been working with legacy code (mostly VS.NET and C#)The biggest problem I've had so far hasn't been figuring out what it all does (although that does take a lot of time) it's been that the first large project I took over literally had NOT ONE COMMENT in it. I never learned to comment my code because a) I'd been the only one to ever work on my own projects and b) the first bits of anyone else' code I'd ever worked on contained no comments. And c) I'm 100% self-taught.It simply never occurred to me that I'd ever need to explain what it was I was doing/attempting to do.It'd taken me nearly 4 years, but I now comment religiously.;;
"I'm sure some people will argue, as this seems to be a hot debate - but I tend to reserve comments for the WHY and not the HOW. As an example: Good Comment: ""Bug Fix: Table on page DocumentView adds one additional blank row at the bottom - functionality to fix.""Bad Comment: ""This bit of code removes the last row of the table by doing blah blah""The first comment tells you why it was implemented, to fix a weird bug the page was having - the second comment tells you what the code does - which gives others, as well as yourself, no indication of why the code was actually added to begin with - and someone looking at this would need to investigate why the bottom row of a table was being removed in the first place.";;
Easy. Just apply.If you get through the application process. Congratz.Now you will face the workload.If it is over your head. You will sit down and study all the stuff after work to get to the point you need.If you can't keep up you will probably get fired, asked to leave or maybe put on simpler tasks.If you were fired you apply for the next one. With new experience. It is great that you don't think you know it all. That gives you opportunity to learn more.But working in the industry is just doing. So do it.;;
To be honest, when I graduate WITH a CS degree and 3 software engineering internships under my belt I will still not know if I am ready.;;
"Your humility is nice, but what do you think will make you ready if you believe current path isn't sufficient? Remember that all programmers wake up in the morning and put their pants on one leg at a time, just like you.  Nobody is superhuman - in fact, most are average. They make mistakes, they have wins and losses, and they learn along the way.  This vaunted concept of ""ready for employment"" helps nobody.  You're ready for employment when someone gives you money for work. Until you ask for dollars in exchange for software, you're simply out of the employment game. ";;
Well, am getting my masters in data mining and analytics, hopefully I will feel more prepared then.;;
I never feel i am ready, simply cause i gonna have to learn at each new place. What u need to prepare is readiness to learn new thing.;;
Your point is a good one, 50% of any software engineer's job is to continuously learn.;;
I am pretty new to programming and am not employed in the field at all but it seems to me from what I have learned so far is that anything you knew 20 or 30 years ago is pretty much useless day to day now and anything you are learning now will be useless in 20 or 30 years as both computers and code evolve. The best thing you can be as a programmer is a quick learner.EDIT: not to say the stuff you learned long ago didn't give you a great foundation for what you are doing today but most major languages (C not inculded) aren't even as old as I am. ;;
Yes, but if you learned to program in whatever language 20 years ago, the same concepts still apply today.Especially in front-end web development, there's a new framework flavor of the week that's popular for awhile, then something comes along and overtakes as the new flavor of the week.There's always something to learn, but if you have a foundation, it's pretty simple to pick up the next thing to learn.;;

I posted an App in the App Store worked to get all the glitches out and now I'm getting hired as freelancer. The only thing that counts. Know the right people and have something to show people.;;
Just try. You don't know. Use the interviews to grow and learn. When you're ready you will get a job and then you will learn what you need. ;;
Look at job postings and see if you qualify. If you don't, learn the skills listed for the job you want. ;;
I don't think you're worried about not getting a job. I think you're worried about what happens if you actually do get hired. Here's the thing: it's their responsibility to make sure they hire the right person. ;;
Personally, it was a motivational thing. When I seen myself learn programming languages on my own, I figured I could do it for a job. Found somewhere that needed a young go-getter, and I started a job I had very little knowledge about because I knew I was going to keep working until I got it. That was a couple of years ago. I guess it all depends on how confident you are that you can do what is asked or learn how to do it.;;
My take is that a lot of the stuff to be learned isn't even taught in a classroom so it's more of a level playing feel than believed.  ;;
Never be afraid to apply for a job. If you aren't getting turned down for a few jobs you are probably shorting yourself. Apply for jobs and let the employer figure out if they want you. ;;
Most professional programmers I encounter are in over their heads anyway.  If you genuinely like programming, you're already better prepared than most of the people I graduated with.  As long as you put the effort in, you'll be fine in any entry-level position.I would recommend applying for positions you know you don't want or don't think you can get, because the interviews themselves teach you a lot about how to get the job you want.;;
Can you program? Great, you are now more qualified than half of the people who graduated from my school with technology degrees. As others have said, start applying. If you can't seem to land an interview, don't give up hope. Instead, head over to /r/resumes and /r/ITCareerQuestions and make sure that your resume contains all the right stuff.;;
Just a bit of a story from my career:I spent too long in school. I'm bad at school. I'm incredibly bad at rote memorization of things that may or may not have any real worth later on. Specifically theory courses kicked my ass. I found an internship, which turned into a full time position. A few years later, I decided I was taking a break from school (after going part time for a few years, and repeatedly failing things). I just started applying. Even if I wasn't entirely qualified for the job - I figured I could learn what I needed to either get past the interviews, or on the job to do the work. I was correct. A few things people told me: * Never apply for something you're entirely qualified for. You'll end up with a position doing things you already know, and not learning much. I ended up taking a job where I was mostly qualified for, and am in the process of leaving two months later. * The worst outcome for any application is a job. The best outcome is either them not getting back to you (because they don't realize what you're worth), or them taking time to interview you, even if you don't get it. I landed a pretty ok opportunity in Seattle, and then landed a very good job that starts next week. Things have definitely changed - once you get a job, finding something better seems pretty easy. ;;
Try to cross post this to /r/CSCareerQuestions they will give you even more answers!;;
"Noone here says ""you can't apply until you at least know bla bla bla"" , its weird. So If I do not know what html and css is and happened to fall on my lucky day and get a job somehow , by all the definition posted here it means I am ready... It depends on what you want to do but just to give an example , if you are going to become a web developer and don't know what html or css is , you are not ready. If you know html/css/javascript and feel you are not ""good"" at it , you might be ready.";;
"What does it even mean to say that one is ""ready"" for a job?If you apply for a web developer position, they ask you on the job interview ""Do you know HTML?"" and you honestly say ""No"", and they hire you anyway, does that means you were ready for that particular job?If you are a 30 year veteran and you apply for a job, and they turn you down because they had someone younger who was willing to do the same job for cheaper, does that mean you were not ready for the job?";;
By my calculations it's if you can sell your software on the white market.;;
One way you can know you are ready is by starting some task/project that you don't know how to do, doing research and reading documentation on how to do it, and then completing the project from your learning.It's something that you'll have to do over and over in your job. If you are a beginner, people don't expect you to know how to do things right away, but they do expect you to learn and eventually finish the things you can't do initially. To some extent this is still true even when you have more experience (they're just less lenient on how long it takes you to ramp up).;;

the degree only matters to HR ladies.  Any dev can pick up if you got skillz in 15 minutes of questioning.  Those are the people that would give you the job.

You're not ready. Not unless you really, absolutely cannot get a degree. The code written by someone who knows how things work versus someone who's just hacking is night-and-day.;;
Even if you teach yourself the right way? I mean, it seems as though you can learn everything they teach you in college on your own, but is the degree really that important?  ;;
You definitely can learn all of the skills you learn in college and get and excellent job without a degree. I've seen engineers with masters degrees write hideous spaghetti code and highschool dropouts maintain excellent programming standards. The degree opens a lot of doors but is in no way proof of your ability. ;;
the piece of paper, not so much. Having professors guide you through 40 years of computer science in 4, however, is pretty sweet. College is not for learning a language, that's something you do can do in a weekend. College is for learning how to learn.;;
For one, HTML is not programming. It is a markup language.To post anything that requires tabbed formatting please read the formatting help. There is also a sidebar that should prove useful. ;;
so no posting html in this reddit?;;
Well it is semantically true HTML isn't a programming language, and neither is CSS.  But almost nobody uses either in the real world without JavaScript, which is a programming language, and the same applies vice-versa, in a browser environment at least.    So while it isn't programming it is definitely programming-related and you can post it here.    Just don't call them programming languages because that's incorrect and people will assume you're stupid. Not condoning it but that's the way it is.    Next time, format the code following the instructions on the submit page. Or you could try something like JSFiddle or CodePen, which let you write HTML/CSS/JS and see the results immediately.  ;;

I am not convinced it's a good way to learn. I've seen people that watch videos, tutorials and live streams for hours and hours, but never sit down and actually write code themselves.Unfortunately programming isn't about memorizing loops and function names (videos might be good at teaching stuff like that), but it is mainly about learning to think a particular way. And you only learn that by doing.Now, maybe in the beginning it might be helpful to see someone else code, to get an idea how to approach things, but it's no substitute for actually writing code.  We frequently get people here that have been learning programming for a while, months sometimes, that have done exercises on interactive websites and watched videos and streams, but they are, according to their own words, unable to figure out how to work on their own projects.I'll put a disclaimer on this and say that everybody learns differently, and who am I to tell you or others how they should learn. If these videos help you, or someone else, by all means go for it. But I'd be careful of the trap where you think you've learned a lot, but in the end are unable to actually apply anything. ;;
Yeah, great point!  I know I need to keep that in mind as well!;;
"Use `input.nextLine()` instead to read in an entire line.  Then, parse it to an integer -- e.g. `option = Integer.parseInt(input.nextLine());`You may have to change the type of Exception you catch too.`nextInt` requires more advanced knowledge of how the scanner works, but as an ELI5 example, you can imagine that you've walked up to the self-checkout lane at a grocery store, and you scan your first two items, which is a box of bananas and your rewards card.  However, the self-checkout scanner is expecting you to scan your rewards card first.You use a loop to continually scan your box of bananas, and the self-checkout scanner keeps telling you that it wants your rewards card.The rewards card is the 2nd item you're going to scan, but since your bananas aren't going through, the cycle just stops there.Don't ask why bananas come in boxes; I don't know.";;

"I had to stare at this way too long... and I am still unclear:Is the ""try"" failing at all?  He has the same debug output for the catch so its not possible to say for sure. But so confused, why would it infinitely repeat and not allow a different input?  Could it be that the first try actually seems to succeed but then the subsequent tries fail immediately?That would make it an error uncaught somewhere inside input.readInt which expects an int, fails horribly otherwise, then blows up the object, preventing anything further submissions?Maybe I need bed?";;
"If `input.readInt()` fails because the input isn't an int, calling the function again won't make it work.For instance, imagine the user typed in ""bob"" instead of an integer.Then, `input.readInt()` thinks ""well, Bob isn't an integer, so I'm going to throw an exception"".Calling `readInt()` again will just result in the same thing: ""Bob isn't an integer, so I'm going to throw an exception.""";;
So input.readInt is still stuck on the previously entered value because its from a textbox?..  I thought it was a prompt derpidydooda... I do need bed!;;
Haven't worked with Java's Scanner class before, but my educated guess is that it doesn't actually clear out the input when it's invalid, so you'll need to manually discard the current character.Incidentally, it would be more concise to just move your if statement after the try-catch, or to put it in a finally block.;;
The difference between GET and POST isn't where data can be sent. While it's more common for GET requests to use query parameters and more common for POST requests to use the request body, either one is allowed to use any mix of both.The huge, important difference is that GET requests are required to be idempotent, which is a fancy way of saying that it's safe to call it twice - it won't change each time you call it.Basically, a GET request should only be used to access a resource - it should never have a side effect.Practically speaking, GET requests may be cached - by the browser, by the company intranet, by mobile web browser caching proxies, and so on. POST requests will never be cached - every time you make a POST request the client must contact the server again, and nobody else in the Internet will mess with the request or response.Also, a GET request from a web browser will allow the user to reload the page. It may be preloaded, it may be fetched again if the user restarts the browser. A POST request will never be preloaded or fetched again if the user restarts.So if you had a form that deletes the latest post from a forum and you made it a GET request, that'd be an awful no-no - the GET request would get called multiple times sometimes and data would be lost.Similarly, using POST to access a large static JSON data table that rarely changes would be a huge waste of resources, because you're not taking advantage of caching opportunities.That's the important difference. Everything else is less important.;;
Thanks for the explanation :). Another question, what if I want to pass credentials, but I can't use cookies due to it being a REST API. This is just a check for a resources, its safe to fire the request a million times, no side effects. Would I want to use a GET or a POST request in this case? I've been using POST so far for every API I've written.;;
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20588467/how-to-do-stateless-session-less-cookie-less-authentication;;
"Cookies are totally allowed in a REST API, especially for something like authentication. What's important is that the server should be stateless; it shouldn't be keeping track of the user's state on the server side and using the cookie as a handle to that data. The client should be keeping track of everything, but it's totally fine to use cookies as a way to pass information to the server that has to be included in every request.";;
POST Requests: Data can be sent using headers, or in the request body(form encoded, or json encoded(string basically)), but not in the URL. Pretty sure you can send it in the URL, for example:http://example.com/cats?cat=catsends the variable cat with the value cat, e.g., php in the $_POST['cat'] you'll find 'cat';;
If that's working it's at best non-standard and shouldn't be employed. I'm not willing to dig through the RFCs and find out, but I'm pretty sure it's outright incorrect to send arguments along with the URL as part of a POST request. (Regardless of what PHP may or may not do.);;
Yeah, I have never seen that anywhere. If you want arguments in the URL you go with a GET request, AFAIK. ;;
Using query strings in HTTP POST is perfectly legal. There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing it.It seems like a silly point to argue about, because it's orthogonal to the real difference.;;
I think [this](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html  ) is a good and short overview over what REST-methods should be used. If you want to dig deeper [Roy Fielding's dissertation](https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm) is the way to go;;
Learning how to code an AI, or a good language to use? On the language side, you could use any to start. So I'd recommend one you're familiar with. If you intend to do a game, then something high level. The aforementioned Lua is good, as are C# and Ruby. However, something that's efficient from a technical standpoint requires a more low level language. Such as C++. Not beginner friendly. So, that just depends on where you happen to be as a programmer.How to code an AI? That's an easy concept, notoriously difficult in practice. You're coding up behaviors, usually human behaviors. To do that, you need to understand the process behind those behaviors. A Tetris example: How do you decide where to put the block, and in what orientation? Do you take into account the next block? Do you factor in patterns that have been known to work well? How do you decide what to do with the first block? Is that based on the block itself, or the next block behind it? Annnddd so on and so forth. You are translating actions that humans take, often without so much as a second thought, and breaking them down into tangible blocks of logic that can dynamically adapt and work together to create a smooth decision making process, that isn't arbitrary and actually responds to a given situation. Which means quantifying the situation in the same way you've quantified the logic in the decision.So.... When it comes to learning how to approach coding an AI, the best place is usually a class, mentor of some kind, or hashing through it yourself. You can learn about the concepts, but they're no good unless you figure out how to put them in code. Creating AI's is incredibly fun, and one of my favorite hobbies. Very rewarding. Good luck. ;;
This is a bit of a side note, but do you possibly have any advice for how to learn how to make a program that plays a game that isn't built into the program? I've heard about a lot of programs like this and have been really interested. ;;
"Depends. If you're thinking about something like a bot, for an online game, then you need to learn how the game talks to the client side, and then emulate it. If you mean an AI that other game makers can use for their games, basically a ""plug-in"" AI, then you could create an API for for AI, and it would be up to the game maker to use that API correctly. However, it would only really be able to play games it's coded to play, unless it can take in instructions and use them on a game by game basis, and store those for future use.";;

But remember, no matter what anyone tells you their standards compliant ECMAscript implementation is going to be different from someone else's: if you look into jQuery you'll learn it was created to solve some of the many idiosyncrasies of being a ""Javascript"" programmer for 3 or 4 browsers and 2 or 3 versions of each.The state of the industry is getting better with every revision of the standards and with every browser update but its such a slow process jQuery like libraries will always have a place in Frontend.

It MergeSorts m to x then it MergeSorts n - m to x + m.;;
http://i.imgur.com/rITkacYh.jpgThis shows the order in which each function is called. Hopefully the numbers are legible.An arrow pointing down and left is the first recursive call. A down and right arrow is the second recursive call. A pair of arrows pointing at the same box is the merge function, which in your example is all the crap after the recursive calls.Just look at this and trace  through the code slowly. Multiple recursion is tricky as shit to follow but it'll click if you keep working at it.;;
Thank you very much - I think I'm slowly starting to get it. ;;
The tree is ordered. You don't go down the left **and** right ... you know which side to go down by comparing the node's value with the value to be found.That's the whole point of building a tree.;;
"Oh yes thanks forgot. So I have this:    AVLNode* findNode(const T& value, AVLNode* node) const {		if (node->data == value) {			return node;		}		else if (node->data < value) {			findNode(value, node->rightChild);					}		else {			findNode(value, node->leftChild);		}	}";;
Correct.You also need to check that node->xxxChild is not null ... which will happen if the value isn't in the tree.;;
"Just add another conditional at the beginning?    AVLNode* findNode(const T& value, AVLNode* node) const {		if (!node) {			return nullptr;		}		else if (node->data == value) {			return node;		}		else if (node->data < value) {			findNode(value, node->rightChild);					}		else {			findNode(value, node->leftChild);		}	}";;
"Yes.As a matter of style I prefer to see the check before the recursion.    If node < value        If node->left == null return null; // can't be in tree        Else return(find(value,node->left))But either way works the same.(Excuse crappy formatting .. Typing on phone)";;
You also need to return the result of `findNode` in the last two cases, instead of just discarding it and running off the end of the function.;;
How/where would I put that?;;
"If you have    findNode(value, node->leftChild);It won't immediately return. While this will:    return findNode(value, node->leftChild);In other words the value from the recursive call is just discarded (recursive calls are no different from calls to other functions in this regard).For example this:        ...        else {            findNode(value, node->leftChild);        }    }Is more or less equivalent to this:        ...        else {            AVLTree *ignored_variable = findNode(value, node->leftChild);        }        //no return by end of function, undefined behavior    }";;
Oh yes I forgot to return, thanks;;
You can't call functions?;;
What do you have in mind?;;
Calling that function on those nodes?;;
Yeah, it's supposed to be recursive. So I figure call the function down the left child and right child recursively.;;
ok, do it.;;
You're useless...check the rest of the thread, problem is solved.;;

I think the source was meant only for Linux, as X11 is the window system.And I wouldn't recommend DevCPP to compile anything beyond basic applications.;;
It looks like it is just for *nix systems, and not Windows, as it requires an X server, and likely POSIX support (Windows has neither stock). Everything I see for it online says it needs a UNIX like system.So, if you wanted to get this going, you'd likely need to use cygwin, for POSIX and X11 support. Even still, not going to be easy, because it wasn't designed for Windows.;;
Okay, thanks for the answer. Gonna look for an alternative. I don't understand why the developers do not bother to include information about what platform it is made for.;;
It kinda does, just not in a way obvious to those who aren't familiar with putting together software.;;

"`bubblesort(p, 4);`~~Your real issue is the array is not being returned and your not passing a pointer into the function so the sorted array is thrown away at the end of the function call~~Edit: My C++ knowledge is worse than I thought";;
> Your real issue is the array is not being returned and your not passing a pointer into the function so the sorted array is thrown away at the end of the function callWhat? If he passes an array to the function it will decay to a pointer. There is no need to return anything.;;
Oh, will it? My C++ is a bit rusty, but I though it would pass the array by value.Disregard my comment then;;
Arrays are never passed by value, in C or C++.;;
Hey, thanks for the correction  Do you have anything to add that might help me understand why the docs require the array to be called on in that spot?void bubblesort(**Person p[]**, int n)I suspect that there is a reason behind it. But I cant see it yet.;;
"Not really sure what you're asking, but like exoticmatter said, when you pass an array to a function, it decays into a pointer. So these two are the same:	void func(int arr[])	{}	void func2(int* arr)	{}	int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};	func(arr);	func2(arr);Both functions receive the address to the first element in the array (&arr[0] or &arr)";;
"so when I call on the bubblesort function in the ""int main()"" part I shoulde be ok with ""bubblesort(p[0], 4);"" and p[0] will tell the function to start at element 0, while 4 will set the value for n (the variable for the total number of elements)?Because that throws up the same error as the OPand I dont see what issue is created when the array decays into a pointer. Does it matter?Oh, and the array contains elements with 2 variables. Name and age. I've managed to get a bubblesort function to work with 1 variable per element arrays. But it craps out when I use 2 variable per element arrays like this one.";;
No, you just call it like:    bubblesort(p, 4)If you pass it p[0], you're just passing the value at array position 0>and I dont see what issue is created when the array decays into a pointer. Does it matter?You just need to be aware of what is actually happening.;;

Are you sure that's correct syntax for adding an element to an array? It looks like that error `Number, Boolean, Variable, (, [ or function expected` is trying to tell you that you've got some kind of syntax error. That's totally just a guess, though. I had never heard of this game before.;;

Took care of it. Learn good layout as soon as possible kids!;;
Just my guess: sounds like your studying is way too theory heavy. The most important part of learning to code is practicing and repetition. I expect them to do exactly that. Many practice projects. Actual coding is not as mind melting as theory learning. 10+ hours is easy.;;
This is a very interesting point actually. Maybe I have been going about it a bit more theory based vs just making things. It's all new to me so I guess at this point I'm unsure how to properly learn to code.  More doing less reading. ;;
"Theory comes more into play when you're actually confident enough in your coding ability, to take a step back, and say ""Hey, there's a better way to do this I'd imagine!"".One of the big things I see new developers try and take on is theory and best patterns/practices. Dont. Learn enough to get a few applications off the ground. Then study the more abstract concepts and reapply them by recreating the few applications you've already done. Your learning process should look something of the sort:Idea > Develop Application > Find faults in application > study similar topics/issues people have had > Remake application with those practices >Repeat.

So I'm interested in learning the MEAN stack, do you know of any places online that show small projects that I could try and mimic? ;;
I would learn one thing from that stack at a timeAngular's documentation is rather good, has a whole tutorial section. There are many, many Node.js interactive tutorials out there. Mongo I'm not sure about because I've never really built anything where a NoSQL database was worthwhile.PluralSight is a really good tutorial hub, same with CodeSchool and CodeAcademy - TreeHouse is pretty nice, but they have a rather rigid focus on iOS and Android development, as well as some nice Ruby tutorials.Web Development really isn't my specialty - though I do quite a bit of ASP.NET. ;;
Not sure if anyone can answer this. Depends on how well you retain information. ;;
I'm talking about how is it possible for anyone to really retain information that's being thrown at them for 8 or 9 hrs straight every day, 6 days a week for 3 months. ;;
Repetition. Easiest way to learn something is keep doing it over and over again.;;
Not necessarily true..;;
go on....;;
Well you can copy something a thousand times and still not understand why or how it works.. ;;
"i didn't see him say anything about 'copy' - thats your word.i know what you mean though.i think retention is about doing something you UNDERSTAND over and over again, so that you will retain it for a long period of time.  learning should be a short part.  its the practice that hammers it in your brain so you dont have to ""learn"" it again";;
So you think in these bootcamps you learn a few things per day, say taking a total of 4 hrs, and then spend the other 4 doing it over and over? ;;
No, you do projects over and over and over again. Repetition. ;;
Ah, ok. Have you been to one? Are they worth the $$$?;;
No I haven't. It depends on your learning style. You work A LOT, like 90 hours a week for 9 weeks. Then you just bang out as much code as possible. ;;
Personally I like to split my 8 hours across a 12 hour day because my brain starts to hurt after 4-5 like yours. But I think it's still very effective, though less pleasant, to go straight through. The most important thing being sleeping well and avoiding things like alcohol that interfere with your ability to retain information. Most of your memories are consolidated and stored to long term memory during sleep.Also not all days are the same, if I'm struggling to grasp a concept or new technology one day 4-5 hours can feel brutal. However if I'm doing something that I know how to do it's a lot easier to end up going over 8 hours without realizing it.;;
This is a very personal question. I went to a boot camp and while I have somewhat similar issues of being burnt out after 5-6 hours of focus, I forced myself to make the most of it and spent 9-10 hours per day learning or at least trying to learn. If you can do that, and you can actually use that time effectively, the camp will be worth it. If you find yourself tired of things after 4-5 hours, not only will you struggle with the camp, but you'll struggle with the job you might get afterward. ;;
If you don't mind me asking, were you able to get a job at graduation? I'd be going in with very basic programming skills. ;;
I was able to get a job within 2 months of graduation and have been employed for about a year. All but one of my co-students (not sure the best term?) had a job in a similar time period. The one who didn't was lazy and made excuses to not work hard, but is now employed and doing well. It's a valuable use of money if you want to accelerate your learning and are prepared to work your ass off. I can't stress enough that a boot camp is hard and is a way of focusing your learning, not an easy way to a high paying job. It's not for everyone. ;;
Also in case it's relevant, I went to Fullstack academy in NYC and the average salary for all the graduates was in the 70-80k range. Most are making 15-20% more than that now. ;;
It is actually. I just looked it up and saw they teach the MEAN stack, which is what this camp does (all others around teach rails). Thanks very much for your input!;;
Oh and last thing, I went in with minimal skills too. I prepped a lot in the few months leading up to going then went hardcore mode once it started. ;;
Been to one. You'll retain whatever you keep practicing. If you stop doing it after the 3 months they have you coding, you'll quickly forget it.;;
that's life bro.  adapt or get left behind ;;
If the bootcamp works with your schedule and you find the idea appealing then go for it! This will build a framework that you could pin a lot of knowledge on. ;;
IMHO these bootcamps sound ridiculous.. You would most likely be better off going to college or university and doing a course.. ;;
They are valuable if you have the mindset where you can learn quickly in an intense environment. They aren't that different from a technical school and have a similar cost to education ratio to college courses. The key is making sure the boot camp you attend is legit and knows what they're doing. Source: went to a boot camp and am doing quite well in the industry now. ;;
My paycheck says otherwise, sir. That said, I did not like the company i attended courses from, but I learned a lot. ;;
Speed, memory consumption, etc.;;
They are much slower and use a good bit more memory. Most of the time that accuracy isn't needed so primitives work well, they're fast and light.;;
They are much slower to work with, and they use more memory. Because arbitrary precision decimals are exact, their size tends to increase as you perform operations on them, which further increases processing time. Using exact arithmetic frequently changes the asymptotic complexity of algorithms using them - for example, adding to BigDecimals is a linear-time operation, while adding two doubles is constant time because they're always the same size. If you aren't using exact arithmetic, BigDecimals are still much slower than a double, but the asymptotic complexity shouldn't change.Doubles offer precision that is high enough for most purposes - BigDecimals should be used if you *need* exact arithmetic (not just a very good approximation), and youdon't care about the extra processing time, or if you want decimal arithmetic rather than binary.;;
Can you describe something where you think you'd need at least 15 digits of precision and exactly why that would require at least 15 digits of precision?;;
"Some languages will ""give you that"" (i.e. big numbers by default out of the box).Among the ""convenient high level languages"" (like java, c#, python, go, haskell, perl, php, javascript, ...), java is supposed to let you write code that is relatively efficient (in fact with the current implementations of the JVM, you can achieve high levels of performance ""given you know what you're doing""). Exclusively using big numbers would simply kill that.";;
Most modern processors include native support for [IEEE floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point). That is, there is circuitry built into the CPU specifically dedicated to processing floating point numbers. This make floating point operations very fast.BigDecimal, on the other hand, is not natively supported. It is simulated using lower-order operations. Consequently, operations on BigDecimal fields are significantly slower than native floating-point operations.;;

"Yes! Of course.But now it gives me another error: ""Cannot make a static reference to the non-static method averageColor(Color, Color) from the type  Color""";;
you have to make averageColor static ex    public static Color averageColor(.....){    //stuff    };;
Also this requires that averageColor() be made static in the Color class. This allows it to be accessed.;;

Ha ha, that's what we're here for.;;
"Also please remember that when you make something static, there's only 1 instance of it.

This allows me to debug explicitly, and often allows me to skip the whole ""wtf is this debug message trying to tell me"" - Doing that was the point at which I noticed me moving from a proficient programmer, to a good programmer.

sounds like the professor brain has been wired to coding. it's really just thinking about every little nuance of everything because the computer only know exactly what you tell it it can't make the inferences that humans can - unless of course you teach it how to make certain inferences. ;;
This sounds simple - but for a lot of people - applying this in reality, especially to business logic complex systems, is a whole area of study in itself. ;;

Somewhat relate the anecdote given by OP.  Learn an accurate mental model of what you're working with.For example, there's a recent post of someone who was using a Scanner class in Java.  They wondered why it wasn't processing the next input correctly when they entered in a non-integer (the program displayed 3 choices, and asked the user to enter 1, 2, or 3).The original poster assumed that if you provided bad input (say, the letter 'A'), then when it attempted to read via scanner.nextInt() that it would cause an exception (which it does), and discard the bad input (which it doesn't).  Thus, the same bad input was being read over and over and not being consumed by the scanner.Now, it's true that reading the Scanner documentation might not point this out as a common problem, but it goes to show that we, as programmers, make assumptions often without realizing it (similar to making a sandwich--we assume the person reading the directions will know what a peanut butter jar is, what knife to use, etc).;;
"Other people have already answered this -- you were just missing the hyphen for the ""learn-more"" class you were asked to apply to the first div element.Note that this isn't an ""error"" in the sense that the code is bad -- you wrote valid HTML; it's just that you didn't answer the question correctly. Technically, something like `<div class=""learn more"">` has *two* classes on it: `learn` and `more`. On the other hand, `learn-more` is a single class.";;

The final argument to range() (3 in this case) is the size of the step to take when traversing the range. So the range starts at 1, steps by 3 to 4, steps by 3 to 7. 7 is out of range and not output.;;
(1,6,3)  means go from 1 to 6 in steps of 31 is the 1st number1+3 = 4 is the 2nd number4+3 = 7, which is bigger than 6,  so the range is done.;;
The third argument is the skip or step whatever you wanna call it. Let me explain: range(start,stop,step).For example if we have a range(0, 11,2), it would start at the zero index and go to the 10 while skipping 2. So we would end up with:0,2,4,6,8,10.I hope i have made it clear for you;;

You should pick one language and focus on learning that. It's much easier to learn new languages once you're already proficient in programming. In terms of tutorials, the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_some_good_learning_resources.3F) has a list of good learning resources.You're probably best off starting with either C#, or HTML/CSS (then JavaScript). C++ has a relatively steep learning curve, SQL is a domain-specific language used for querying databases and so is not broadly applicable, and AJAX is not a language -- it's a sort of technique.;;

"> Be extremely advanced in any language that would help me with these goals.""Extremely advanced"" takes a lot of time and effort to achieve. That's not intended to be discouraging. Rather, just realize that if you work in a language for a year or two, that really only gets you to ""reasonably proficient"" if you are diligent. ""Extremely advanced"" can take much, much longer than that.> Be able to look at source code and understand what it does and what I can do to change it in such a way that will accomplish what I need to accomplishThis also takes a fair amount of work.

start with high level language. the nuances are just easier but programming at the end of the day is about a) solving problems by abstracting logic b) doing tons of research/reading to implement needed libraries to solve problems c) repeating steps a b over and over again. so since right out of the gates you can't code say an mp3 library, a feature enriched website hooked to a database with user authentication the works, or even probably a tic tac toe game. i would say http://delphiforfun.org/Programs/10_easy_pieces.htm work through these challenges. they're great at learning how to write computer algorithms. if you have ogod math foundation  iwould suggest its secondary counter part projecteuler which has same type of problems just a little bit more difficult math. once you can get into the flow of solving them problems i'd say you're ready to take on your first coding project. this is where b) of my first paragraph will come heavily into play. google the shit out of libraries, them libraries tutorials, documentation, and in general just questions along the way. it may feel heavily assisted but realize you're building your first piece of software while learning a lot.i'm going to add an edit that what i referred to as 'high level langauge' is no considered 'very high level language' these include - python, perl, visual basic. it just much easier to read/write then say c but i don't feel like you're short changing yourself it's just an easier syntax to pick up on as a beginner but same programming concepts. ;;

"As a traditional enterprise-level desktop application developer, I feel your pain.  Recently, I inherited an old ASP.NET (no-MVC) website via a promotion and the original developer dying. Having never done any sort of web development, I started diving into the web development world - it was pretty much a culture shock. The web development community is the Wild West, and is a bit scary to someone with a career in a very solidified, standards-based development community.  I find the web development community to be really immature, scatter-brained, and unorganized as a whole.  Hopefully though, seeing developments that have come about in the last few years, that the community kind of cleans itself up and becomes more standardized with less ""new, awesome technologies"" coming out as more and more enterprise-level applications are coming to the web. I prefer to use well-grounded, stable technologies that don't have the sort of volatility that a lot of newer technologies have.  It's safe for me as a developer, and safe for a business' bottom-line. Most businesses don't need, nor want, the most cutting-edge technology.  They want applications that are written that can continue to be run for a decade or more.  This is better for their checkbooks. ";;
"I am not 100% sure this is the only issue, but it may be the (a) cause: When you execute the line:        value = valueThe compiler doesn't know which ""value"" you mean, the one in your class or the argument being passed into the constructor. It is probably assigning the argument in value back into the same variable. You should use the ""this"" keyword to set the value:     Node(int value){                 left=NULL;                 right=NULL;                 this.value=value;             }         };EDIT: Or an alternative is to change the constructor's parameter to a different name such as ""inputValue"" etc.";;

That value is unpredictable and may differ from run to run.* The compiler will observe that the comparison is undefined behaviour, and optimize out the if statement entirely. Compilers are allowed to assume that undefined behaviour will not happen when optimizing; if your program invokes undefined behaviour, *you have no guarantees about it's behaviour*";;

I wasn't really able to ascertain what words of discouragement were told to you, but I think a healthy mix of encouragement, and warning is good for the budding programmer. Becoming a good software developer isn't all sunshine and rainbows, as they'd say it.  There's a good dose of frustration, misunderstanding, there will be at least one point in your career - as you journey towards code enlightenment - where you tell yourself you just can't do this - you, and only you are the only person in the world that just can't understand this one particular concept that you'll need to learn to reach the next barrier in your education. Software Development is an extremely rewarding career.  90% of the time though, it's filled with frustration, outside forces dictating what you should be coding and how you should be coding it, long - sleepless nights, many hundreds of gallons of coffee and mountain dew, and eventually you'll get to the point where you've failed so much so often that you'll, hopefully, start seeing code in your sleep and begin to be considered a seasoned developer. This isn't to discourage you though, it's just to set an expectation that software development IS hard - it's the reason we get paid a lot of money to type out lines of gibberish, and many more people fail at it than succeed. ;;
"You've made an excellent choice by continuing to pursue your interests. As you explore more deeply, you'll find more and more people who will be supportive and relate to your experience. I want to share a thought about those who suggest you are ""too much of a people person to code"". Quite frankly, this can be one of your greatest assets. Many people who are avid programmers actively avoid the people-oriented aspects of software development, or at least lack an aptitude for it. That said, there is a wonderful subset of programmers (of whom I'd like to think I am also a member :) ) who enjoy the more social aspects of it. Embrace it, and eventually you will find yourself to be an invaluable part of a team, the liaison between the people-loving management/marketing people and the more private members of the development team. I've found endless opportunities and power in being able to negotiate the two worlds, to the point that I went on to start a successful consulting company focused specifically on that dynamic. No doubt, you will find your own unique space. It sounds like you have the determination, attitude and curiosity to create a great experience for yourself. Good luck along the way!";;
I'm using the built-in unittest module. I can run all my tests (130 as of last count) by typing       python3 -m unittestI think you are confused about the setUp() and tearDown() methods. They are run before and after each of your unit tests. I'm not sure why you would want to re-implement this great convenience, rather than just take advantage of it. I use it mostly to reinitialize the same object for each unit test.You can have as many different files as you want. Simply use the discovery mechanism (https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#test-discovery)  ;;
Thanks for the tip about the test discovery!As for the setup/teardown functions, I understand what they do, was just trying to give an example.  I think what I'm more trying to figure out is what *else* unittest has to offer.;;

As far as I can tell, you're assuming that `zipcode` will contain 14 characters, when it very clearly doesn't.  Why are you doing that, rather than just looping over the characters of `zipcode`?Furthermore, lines 123-129 make no sense.  If you're going to return a string of null characters, why return anything at all?  And what's the use of setting `sum` to zero if it's going to be destroyed on line 130 anyway?;;
Exactly. OP, don't return a string, and don't reset the characters to null.Also, why is your zipcode array exactly 14 characters long?;;
Err, `zipcode` isn't an array.;;
I suppose a better way of having dealt with the size of zipcode would be to determine the length of the string after having input it. I only set it to 14 because the longest possible zipcode would be 1234-5678+90.;;
You don't even have to explicitly mention the length anywhere.  Just change the loop on line 49 to be    for (char c : zipcode) {        // ...and you're good.;;
Oh. That is correct.I was just curious about the length of the string. As far as I know, general zipcodes can be 5 digits long with an additional 4 digit extension. ;;
Well, that completely solved the problem. I just removed lines 123-129 and set sum to 0 in the declaration of it.I had only added those lines because of an error I encountered with printing previous values if the program was repeated. Though that was on my cygwin terminal. That'll teach me to rely too heavily on that.;;

Age isn't really an issue with software engineering.  There's a guy on the development team that I'm on who was a trucker until the age of 45 or so - then started getting into computers - he's now well past 70 and is one of the best developers I've had the pleasure of working with. The great thing about a programming job is most people don't even look at college degrees, they just want to know you have an aptitude for continuing to learn and proficiency in programming.  Most young programmers, it seems, these days are focused more on mobile and web development - and honestly - that's not where the money's at if you're looking for a fat paying job. If you can handle the environment, the best paying development jobs are those writing proprietary software for enterprise-level businesses on expensive technology like Oracle/BizTalk/Cloverleaf/etc. I would highly suggest, that if you're looking to pursue a serious career in software programming that you start off by learning C(Not C++, just straight C) and skip the web development portion, at least in the beginning.  If you take up web development as your first go at software development, you'll very quickly get tied down by a bunch of horribly written tutorials out there, what of the gazillion technologies you should be using, etc. Instead, learn and become proficient with C.  C is the basis for most programming languages out there, it will give you a great understanding of how data actually moves at the lower-levels of a computer, and will force you to learn how to write software correctly as a whole. Bonus: It'd also be good to learn the basic theory/practices in a more formal setting of Computer Science.  Harvard University has their CS50 class online that you can watch, and it's a really good introduction to Computer Science - I'd recommend it. https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x;;
Thank you so much for the detailed response;;
Michigan? .net is pretty popular in the midwest and asp.net has some really good tutorials. But learning PHP, Java, Ruby, Python or others wouldn't be a horrible choice either. If you had done it a little and liked it then I say absolutely yes, go for it. Programming is in such high demand because so few people actually like to do it. And if you can show that you can actually write code and understand things, you'll get a job, programmers are in just too high of a demand. You may have to start in an internship style of job, but just need to get your foot in the door somewhere. ;;
I mean when I was down in FL, as I was teaching myself SQL, I was getting to the point where I could write my own queries and started getting pretty damn good if I might say so myself. I have forgotten most of it but was doing some refreshing and picked up what I did know pretty quickly. ;;
How do you expect to compare `Person`s? What does it mean for a person to be greater than another? You need to define your own operator or compare some field.;;
I want to compare them by age (int alder) and the youngest person is listed first;;
You'd want something like:     if (myList[j].age > myList[j+1].age);;
Haha, bingo but with one caveatAlex, the youngest person at 15, is printed out with an age of -1375189248 http://i.imgur.com/6H31b0S.png;;
Your picture doesn't show what you mention, but most likely you have forgot to initialize a variable somewhere.;;
I ran the program a few extra times. Sometimes the age is 15, and sometimes the age is a random negative number;;
The link to your code doesn't work, by the way.  We could probably help more if it did.;;
"They let me use this code to compare the persons     void byt(Person &p, Person &q)    {    Person temp;    temp.namn = p.namn;    temp.alder = p.alder;    p.namn = q.namn;    p.alder = q.alder;    q.namn = temp.namn;    q.alder = temp.alder;    }";;
That doesn't compare anything. Why do you think it does?;;
I read the description wrongit swaps the place of the values inside of the variables of two elements of two arrays, Person &p, and person &q)& points to the memory adress of the variable. So the value of variable p in the array labeled Person can be found at the memory adressThat snippet of code swappes the values of the variables at the memory adressThe code I've already written in the OP swaps the places of the elements by changing their index value;;
Really, the problem is exactly what the compiler says.  It expects an `operator>` to be present, and you don't have one.  You need to do something like    bool operator>(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs) {        // compare members    }It would be more idiomatic to use `operator<`, but that's just convention.;;
"You meant that I have to specify which of the variables from the class that I want to sort by? name(namn) or age(alder)?Is that what operator is about?So,//inner loop searches element per element in the list        int nrLeft = max - n; // Keeps track of nr of elements searched so far                for (int j = 0; j < nrLeft; j++)        {                        bool operator>(Person const& namn, Person const& alder);            if (myList[j] > myList[j+1]) //Compares elements            {                //Swap places                int temp = myList[j];                myList[j] = myList[j+1];                myList[j+1] = temp;            }        }^ That code failedHow do I even implement a bool operator? It isnt covered in this course";;
You just need to write some code that decides, given two `Person` objects, whether one is greater than the other.  You can treat `operator>` as a normal function, and `operator>(lhs, rhs)` should evaluate to true if `lhs` should be considered greater than `rhs`.;;
"They gave me this code to compare two person objects    void byt(Person &p, Person &q)    {    Person temp;    temp.namn = p.namn;    temp.alder = p.alder;    p.namn = q.namn;    p.alder = q.alder;    q.namn = temp.namn;    q.alder = temp.alder;    }... I think I might understand it nowI get that I can use the boolean piece with an if loop to see if i should change the index places of the elements";;
That doesn't look like code that compares objects.  Compare is when you decide which is bigger.;;
"Haha, yes, you're right. See how confused I am?How do I write code that compares objects How do I point out that it is the age (alder) part of the person class elements in the array that I want to compare?The boolean code line compares lhs, rhs - but why?  Is it lefthandside, righthandside?Lets say I write this:    bool operator>(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs);It evaluates as true (or 1) if... bool operator is larger? what is happening there?";;
"Yes, `lhs` and `rhs` are short for lefthandside and righthandside respectively.You have to write the code for comparison yourself.  For example, to compare age, you might do    bool operator<(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs) {        return lhs.age < rhs.age;    }If you want to compare something else, compare a different member.";;
Where does lefthandside and righthandside come from, what is is lefthandside and righthandside of?Is it lfs and rhs as in lfs is higher indexplace and rhs is lower indexplace?;;
They're the left and right sides of what you compare.  When you do `a > b` where `a` and `b` are both of type `Person`, that calls `bool operator<(Person const& lhs, Person const&)` with `a` being passed as the `lhs` parameter and `b` as the `rhs` parameter.They are compared however you define the comparison.;;
"When comparing two person objects, and you're saying that you want to compare based on their age. operator> method means you're **changing** the way ' > ' works when used with Persons. Within an operator> function (like /u/jesyspa originally gave) you need to give logic that compares the ages. For example:    bool operator>(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs){    if (lhs.alder > rhs.alder) // *or whatever you stored age as*    {       return true;    }    else return false;Something like this. Does that make sense? The code you have in your latest comment makes no sense, it's just the declaration...";;
"Note that    if (foo)        return true;    else        return false;is an antipattern in sanely-typed languages.  You want just    return foo;or    return bool(foo);";;
I'll point to you here, it's been a while since I've been in C++;;
Its a wash anyway since I dont think that I am allowed to use the boolean code to compare in this particular program on this particular assignment :SI'll use it on the next assignment though. Its going to be a compilation of all the terminal programs I've written so far. With a menu and userdefinable variables where its needed.;;
"There's already a standard linux program that does this. It's called `cat` (short for ""concatenate""). If your intentions are to utilize this functionality, you should use the standard program. Windows users can get it with Cygwin (and probably MinGW).Example usage:    # Writes the concatenated files to standard output    cat file1.txt some/path/file2.txt /home/mike/file3.txt    # Writes the concatenated files to a file    cat file1.txt file2.txt > concatenated.txt>I am not sure about how'd it know where to place that file.You'd have to specify that. You currently have mere strings and would have to write those to a new file. But it's better to write to stdout and then let io redirection allow writing to a file (as shown above) so that you can also use the program in a pipe (eg, `cat file1.txt file2.txt | grep ""search query""`).If none of my post makes sense to you, I highly recommend spending some time learning the command line, first. Not only is it great for productivity, but many things do not have a GUI approach (so you must know the command line). As well, when creating a command line program as you are, without knowing the command line, you'd end up wasting time implementing things that the command line can already do for you.Even more, you might create a program that can already be done with other programs (such as `cat`, as shown above) or a combination of other programs. You may also end up writing programs that are very inefficient for your workflow. One common mistake beginners often make is to have a ""press enter to exit"" at the end of their program, which prevents you from easily using that program in scripting and ultimately stems from a misunderstanding of how to use the command line.";;
Oh, thank you. I was struggling creating specific files in my documents, so I thought I'd create such program, but there is already such functions in Windows Powershell, so I just use it. Thanks for the clarification.;;
So kind of like... Notepad?;;
Because building things with tangible items can get really expensive. Building things with letters and numbers... not so much. :) ;;
I agree, making almost anything else involves costs other than my time. Programming is generally a single time fee for my computer and then all I pay is time and electricity. Misplace a part and it's not a huge deal, just move it to where it is needed.This is also why almost everything we build nowadays is first modeled on computers.

"Oh and forgot to say what I like about programming...I just like building things!  Programming reminds me of when I was a kid playing Sim City 2000 or something.  I have been learning for about a year and 2 months now.  About a week ago something clicked and I was like ""I am not going to truly get better until I am literally getting paid to develop full time and learn"".I mean I code quite a bit now at work but the problem is I need to be around developers who are BETTER than me so I can learn more.  That is the key. So, now I am just applying to all the Python developer jobs that I can and looking for someone who will give me my first chance.I saw this cool post recently that has also really inspired me:https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/34r807/im_32_years_old_and_just_started_my_first/";;
I really like your go-getter attitude! I hope the job search goes well for you.;;
Thanks!  How long have you been learning now?  What has your experience been like?  What are you hoping to do with programming?;;
Something I like to do with programming is web scrape.  I've built an application that searches a ton of job sites at once and compiles a report on my desktop for me to look through.  I'm thinking of building another one for travel sites. I knew a guy in my school that started programming years before I did and he managed to build a crawler that would register his classes for him.   ;;
Awesome, I have been thinking of doing this for some things like alerting me of online sales. Do you have any recommendations for how someone can get into web scraping? ;;
This is what I used because Ruby is my primary language: http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/web-scraping/.  If you are more interested in JavaScript, Scotch.io has a good tutorial for nodejs: https://scotch.io/tutorials/scraping-the-web-with-node-js.;;
"> ...what drew you to them/why you like them.Building something from scratch, I've found, is akin to raising a child... okay, maybe no where near that level of intimacy, and I'm not a parent, but that's the best way I could describe it. Even if the end result was a steaming pile of mess, it was my steaming pile of mess. I could go back to refine and reinforce it, make it better than before, and that fact itself is what keeps me interested and passionate about learning new things. With each new thing, it opens up new pathways for how I can improve my program. For instance, 3 months ago, I knew nothing of concurrency, and always shied away from multi-threading topics because, hell, why bother when a single-threaded terminal application works just fine? Now I focus on making all of my projects thread safe and make use of multi-core processing power whenever possible. It's only recently that I'm delving into networking as well, as both concurrency and networking seem to go very well together, and I hope to create better, and more efficient programs.TL;DR: Learning new topics help create better apps. This fascinates me.";;
I've been contemplating the same myself but at 30 I find myself thinking I've missed the boat. I studied it at uni so I have a grasp of the basics but can't ignore the fact that the last 6 years were spent developing a career on a different trajectory ie finance. ;;
My boyfriend also works in finance and his boss studied computer science. It's my understanding that some careers even within finance require some programming knowledge. Also, I've seen enough accounts on reddit to see it's not too late to learn more and even switch into another field! ;;
I work in a casino and I use VBScript and VBA to make keeping up with the software easier. Having this knowledge got me over a seven dollar an hour raise in a year and a half.;;
I studied Finance and once I completed the degree I went and completed another degree in CS and graduated June 2015 at 29.Because I had done math optional course during my finance degree and the fact it was my 2nd degree at the same university; I was a large chunk of the CS degree so I was able to complete it in 2years( did burst my ass at school and in personal project to reach my current level ).I now work at a large bank as a programmer Analyst.;
Career switcher here.What I love about programming is the complete freedom to create anything I want to. Whether I want to scrape data, make a sleek website or a 2D platformer - all I need is my Macbook Pro and an internet connection. The skills I learn at my new IT job transfer to my private projects and vice versa. I've been programming for 18 months and I'm still completely in love with it.;;
I really enjoy writing programs for other programmers to use! Most of my job isn't actually creating a 'thing', but making libraries for the other team members to use.  This is a lot of fun to the point where I do it in my spare time on Github!  I mainly use C# and Scala at work. ;;
There are a lot of good techniques in this book:[Working Effectively with Legacy Code](http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052);;

  1 . Fix bugs and add unit tests for the now-fixed code.Or look through recent bug fixes and add unit tests for the code that was fixed.Testing currently or recently broken code,  and recent changes is going to be of potentially more use that picking some code at random and testing that.  2 .  If there is anything related to explicit security,   user-input,  network input,   then bugs found new tests there are going to be more valuable than testing, for example, the UI;;
> Fix bugs and add unit tests for the now-fixed code.I would suggest the other way around. Write a unit test for the code as it should be. The unit test should be red before you fix the bug and green after you've fixed it.;;
Good point,   that is a better idea.;;
I don't know any frameworks to use for ASP.NET so I hope you get an answer to that. But for your second question, at the place I'm working all of our unit, functional and integration tests are integrated to Jenkins so they are run every time we create a build.Also at least the JavaScript tests can be used on autowatch so everytime you change something and save, it runs the tests. But that's used mostly when you refactor something.;;
Unit testing legacy applications can be very hard when you're new at it, especially if the apps wernt designed with testing in mind.Testing an MVP asp.net webforms site is a lot easier than testing a regular webforms mess.To get started id suggest you try on a new project. Write tests first, use an IOC container for dependency injection (unity perhaps).That will be much easier, then when you have got your head around testing think about testing the legacy stuff;;
> I need to find projects to do , I have creativity problems and can't come up with new ideas to doFind sites that already exist (particularly ones that you think are well-designed or whose designs have really interesting elements) and see if you can recreate them (or aspects thereof).

To clarify, you have six pushbuttons connected to port A, one with a correct pullup and five with incorrect pullups.The purpose of a pullup is to pull the voltage up on a pin when it would otherwise be disconnected (button not pushed) , so it is connected between the port pin and the positive supply voltage.;;

Exactly what I wanted Thanks!Is it better to have the least variables possible or the two are equally good?;;
I'd say adding the extra variable keeps things cleaner and clearer. You are not sacrificing anything by adding one extra double.;;
Also, Happy Cake Day!;;
Wow I just realized, thanks :);;
It's not worth reducing variables used in most cases. The difference in performance is minimal and readability is WAY more important. Some people really understate how important readability is. Code exists to be read by humans.The machine code that is read by machines can also be subject to many optimizations and you should be wary about trying to outsmart the compiler (they're pretty good at what they do).;;
> The difference in performance is minimalAnd usually not present. Inlining and simplifying expressions is a big part of what an optimising compiler does. However, in this case, the intermediary step is probably needed anyway. The JVM is a stack machine, so both cases would compile to something like:    push first_number    push second_number    push third_number    add    add    push 2    divide    call System.out.printlnFunctions take *evaluated* arguments (in most programming languages), and so the arguments actually need to be evaluated first!;;
"You can calculate the result in your println statement:    System.out.println(""("" + first_number + "" +"" + second_number + "" +"" + third_number + "") / 2 is... "" + ((first_number + second_number + third_number) / 2) );But that makes for a very long print statement. The variable keeps things cleaner, but it's your code, so you do your thing.";;
Thanks!yeah in this case its long but I guess I could have chosen shorter variables :);;
I see what you're saying. In this case it's purely a stylistic choice so whatever suits your fancy.;;
"Although more code, you could create a function and use it throughout the program.    private double calculate(double first, double second, double third)        {            return (first + second + third) / 2;        }Usage:    System.out.println(calculate(first_num, second_num, third_num));";;
started learning not long ago so some of these I don't know yet but I'll be sure to check it out once I'm more experienced. thanks!;;
You have semicolons after each if statement. This evaluates the if statements and throws away the result, then executes the block below the statements. Remove the semicolons and you should be in good shape.;;
Thanks so much! Can't believe I didn't think of that. I panicked when I got some errors and threw semi's on almost every line.;;
No problem! Whether you forget them, or add extra, semicolons always seem to have it out for programmers.;;
"Your conditional statements here are structured poorly. Rather than three completely separate `if` statements, you should be writing this as an `if`–`else if`–`else` structure:    if (yournumber == 7)    {        cout << ""You guessed my number "";    }    else if (yournumber > 7)    {        cout << ""Your number is too high! "";    }    else    {        cout << ""Your number is too low "";    }This has at least three advantages:1. If the first condition (`yournumber == 7`) is true, then there is no need to test the other conditions, because they will certainly be false. The three conditions are mutually exclusive. In the code that you wrote, all three conditions will always be tested, because you have written three totally separate `if` statements. That is at best inefficient; in a different context, it could be a serious bug. In the `if`–`else if`–`else` structure, if `yournumber == 7` is true then the rest of the conditional structure will be skipped completely; and in the worst case only two conditions are tested (`yournumber == 7` and `yournumber > 7`), rather than three.2. An `if`–`else if`–`else` structure guarantees that exactly one of the three blocks will be executed. This matches the behavior that you intend for the code to have. It also means that the compiler will be able to use this structure to reason better about the code, perhaps catch more bugs or do better optimizations or suppress warnings that aren't actually worrisome.3. With an `if`–`else if`–`else` structure, the compiler would have told you about your extraneous semicolons, because the `else if` and `else` parts would not have a previous `if` statement to go with them (because it was terminated by the semicolon).";;
"Also, just a coding tip, you might replace the literal number 7 in all of your if statements with your variable ""mynumber"". Otherwise, the variable ""mynumber"" is useless in this code. And, if you want to change your number later, using the variable will allow you to change it in one place instead of changing it in all of your if statements. ";;
Totally forgot about that. I had intended to do what you said, but wasn't thinking.;;
What compiler are you using?  Many will warn about this.;;
pocket c++ for Notepad++ It's good enough, not the problem. Thanks though!;;
Looks like that uses gcc, which is fully capable.  I'm not sure how to configure pocket c++ to enable warnings.  If you can figure it out, the warning documentation is here: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Warning-Options.htmlI'd recommend turning on -Wall and -Wextra if you can.;;
"You should add << endl after all your couts to not have them all appear on the same line. This also flushes the stream which will prevent various issues if you ever get into multithreading or abrupt power loss scenarios.cout << ""Your number is too high!"" << endl;  ";;
You shouldn't have those numbers as global variables and your variable name is tough to read. Change it to yourNumber;;
"Newb programmer myself but heres a couple pointers:Start declaring your variables inside the main function. Global variables ( variables outside a function ) are frowned upon.  When you are programming multi function programs ( not hard to learn btw), youll see why.DON'T hardcode variables. Like YTVF said, in this program use mynumber in your if statements, not 7.Imagine if you wanted to change the number to 8.  Its a simple program, and thats already alot of work to change instead of simply declaring int mynumber = 8;As a cool project , try going to cplusplus.com and implementing the random function to make a random number for your game.  This will teach you many useful skills, like declaring header files for a new library, and reading documentation for existing code so you can implement it.  HINT: you're using namespace std, so you can remove ""std::"" out of any code you find.Some of this advice may be a bit strict looking but professors at school drilled it into me because it helps you understand program structure at a much higher level.Good luck";;

It looks like this could be doable, of course you're at the whim of the site developers changing it up, but I made a thing.[script](http://pastebin.com/Lxmp6W4e)[output](http://pastebin.com/6qujeqEP)Obviously there would be a lot more work to do, but it shows it's probably possible. Probably.;;
Is this just a list of all the games? I'm actually looking to scrape the starting lineups from each game.;;
Yes that just gets a list of the games, but the link to the page with more info is probably in the same data this is taken from, this is a proof of concept if you like.Python or Ruby are probably the easiest languages to do it in, though you may be able to do it with some Excel script, I have no idea.If your interested in learning to program then this is certainly hard for a first project, but it should be possible.;;
Check out https://www.kimonolabs.com/.  Its a web scraping / API service that removes most, if not all, of the coding from what you're trying to accomplish.  You can assign names to elements on the page and you'll be able to download the data in an Excel friendly format (CSV).;;
Can I scrape entire seasons worth of games automatically using this software?;;
Since you have no programming knowledge, you could just pay someone to do this for you, but if you wanted to do this yourself then it'd probably be a decent idea to learn Python and then how to scrape webpages using it.I can't recommend much of anything in the way of learning it from scratch, but Derek Banas has a decent Python video on YouTube IIRC.;;
"In short, if you have *no* programming knowledge or experience, this would be pretty difficult. Excel skills are great, but they kind of pale in comparison to the needed skills for writing a real application. However, I think that building a web scraper is an absolutely fantastic learning project! If you want to learn, this would be a great starting point. It might take you a few months if you're starting from no experience, but you gotta start somewhere.If you want to do this yourself, here's the concepts you'd need to learn:-Basic HTML (including the DOM, etc) -- this is what the page you're scraping is made from. You'd need to understand this stuff before you can really do anything.-Basic Javascript and JQuery -- this is what you'd use to locate specific elements in the page (ie the lineup table), traverse through their child elements (ie each row containing the player information), and extract the needed information.-Ajax (using jQuery; really this could be lumped in with the previous step) -- this is what you'd need to use to retrieve the data (ie the HTML page) from the website.With these tools you can build a pretty basic web scraping application. Along the way, you can pick up on other stuff like styling with CSS, or creating a backend using PHP/Rails/Django or whatever else.Otherwise, if you're serious about paying someone to do this for you... feel free to send me a message.";;
Wow, that's a lot of stuff to learn from scratch. I'll probly end up hiring help if it's going to be that difficult.;;

Damn, you're right. At first I thought that this number goes in order from game to game but after looking closely that's not always the case.Too bad because if I could figure this out I think I could scrape what I need in a spreadsheet using /r/jwjody/ 's method.;;

The main limitation is speed - a native app runs several times faster.There's other problems as well, for example limited access to the file system, limited access to hardware acceleration and lack of libraries (and languages) to do traditionally native things.You can do more in web apps than ever before, but if your app is even slightly performance sensitive then you need native code.;;
>When should you build apps this way instead of building a native app?It can make sense when the app requires a complex GUI that can be created quicker with HTML/CSS/JS and the performance constraints isn't an issue. It can also be useful if you already have a good deal of functionality available in HTML/CSS/JS (eg, from a website).It's very important to keep the performance scaling in mind, though. If you may be needing performance in the future, this choice could be a major constraint. Fortunately, many simple applications don't care much about performance and that is unlikely to change.>Can you use these languages to make games and distribute them through steam and/or mobile app stores?Sure. You'll need special frameworks for mobile, though, like [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).>What would be the best way to get started today if I wanted to start building things other than websites?Depends totally on how your programming skills are. I've seen a lot of people who only know HTML/CSS/JS and they can't actually program. They can hack together some basic DOM modifications, but that's about it. If that's the case, you'll probably want to learn how to program, first.Otherwise you can pretty much just jump into creating the application. Do whatever tutorials the framework offers (since you'd need a framework of some kind to utilize HTML/CSS/JS in a desktop app) and build on to that.;;
Yes there is... You'll probably want to have a method in the GUI class that manages the listbox that calls the Database class requesting data.There's a lot of ways to do it, depends on what you like to do and what your code structure looks like.;;
"The code I'm currently using to read from the database and populate the listbox is this. Mostly what I want to do is just move it to another class to get the foreach statement out of the form class, trying to separate logic, like loops, and of course sql from the form class.                 DataTable dt = SQLAccess.SelectFromTable();                 listBox1.Items.Clear();                foreach (DataRow row in dt.Rows)                {                     listBox1.Items.Add(row[""ColName""] );                 }";;
Sooooo why don't you do that?You clearly know how to call methods of a class. What are you confused by? ;;
I'm not sure. I just got it working, I had to repaste listbox1 everywhere it said listbox1 for whatever reason. Not sure what caused that.;;
Sounds like you got it, but for future reference, if you need to access stuff in other classes, then they need to be public. Are you working in web forms or MVC?;;
MVC. And everything was public all I did was rewrite, letter for letter, the name. ;;
There is no general list of things to pay attention to when programming.It would *probably* vary entirely depending on what you're working on, which language(s) you're using, which tools/IDE you're working with, etc...;;
This is more of a list of things to work toward as a beginner to tailor yourself for a less-frustrating future.* If the company, if you do, work for doesn't currently have a coding style guide, make one for yourself. (How you go about naming variables/methods/classes, how comments are laid out, etc). Consistency in writing code is key for less confusion in the long run.* Don't use comments to tell what you're application is doing, self-documenting code should be the ultimate goal, instead save commenting your code for WHY you implemented that code in the first place. This will make it much easier for you and other coders to read your work.*Learn to break up your code into manageable chunks, same with thinking about problems. This may seem like a 'duh' skill, but its one of the hardest skills to get REALLY good at - especially foreseeing problems before you write a single line of code.*Learn to step through chunks of your code as you complete them, preferably with breakpoints in debugging tools. This will help you catch logical errors before your customers do.*When beginning solutions from scratch, try and write a logging system that will output a log file with pass or fails as you write portions of your application. For complex applications, most debuggers can't be trusted - and you'll save yourself hours of hunting for silly little bugs when you can look at some simple pass/fail notifiers in a text file. *Even if its a personal project, write code as if everyone in the world is going to critique it. At some point in your career, you will have wrote an application that you thought was just going to be a personal project - and it will turn into something greater that many other people will look at, contribute to, or maybe even inherit.;;
"This is a better way (that actually works) to pass parameters to a callback. Although I'm not really a web guy so if someone knows better please chime in.    $(document).ready(function(){      var value = 5;        $(""#myButton"").click(function(event){            //event is the actual callback event            myFunction(value);        });    });        function myFunction(value){     console.log(value)       }Another issue... you're calling (or trying to) `validationAttempts(att)` when the function definition has no parameters. `function validationAttempts(){...}` ";;
"The only issue I see with this is: if you change the ""value"" in myFunction, the change is essentially lost, returning it back to value would not change the value from when the context of the onclick event was defined and ergo that value will always be 5.  But I was never much of a jQuery ninja, I could very well be wrong.";;
Yeah I agree. This was meant as an example of passing a parameter through a callback and actually attaching a callback to a selector. The OP didn't really explain much of what his problem was. ;;
Question didn't state an error or unexpected behaviour; was a puzzler for shizzle.;
"You have some options: make that var att global and stop trying to pass it as an argument in the callback.  You could also attach it as a new attribute on the input button's DOM too, that way you have a unique ""attempts"" field for each input.  https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/ is designed for this type of stuff.The problem is, ""att"" no longer exists once the ""page ready function"" event has finished running, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11152977/global-javascript-variable-inside-document-readyRomple is showing a method to use an anonymous function to wrap the actual callback function and get a parameter to work, but I believe the value will be undefined in his example.  Also it will be passed by value as it is a primitive type, so you will need to return it to something at some point...  I am a little rusty though so try it out and let us know would ya!Also, I found this code example of how to clean up using anonymous functions pretty cool, but don't think it will help in this case: https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/beware-anonymous-functions/";;
Tell me about some projects you've worked on.;;
Write a program to calculate the sum of all leap years from 1800 to 2100.;;
Naming conventions everyone understands so the user/developer knows what's in them without needing to figure anything out of dig through them. Nothing more.* lib - libraries, collections of stuff that help you do other stuff in your code* bin - binaries, commands, and general purpose scripts* src - main source folder* dist - distribution - the application that is ready to be shipped out* build - source code built, but not ready for distributionNone of these are required and can be mixed and matched and named anything the developer wants. Like I said, just a naming convention. By following good coding and naming conventions, future you and others can work on your code. Writing code is easy. Writing code that can be easily supported, modified, and extended in the future by you and other people, without  needing to deconstruct everything every time, takes a lot of work.;;
In my experience, `bin` is often generated binaries and wouldn't be a part of the repo. Some build tools will utilize a `target` folder for the same purposes.;;
There is no standard.  Any project can name any directory anything.  Conventions vary.  You can't answer this question in the general case except to say build the project and see what the directories contain.;;
"> The general consensus from this subreddit is saying, ""stick with one language and learn as much as you can""...so I signed up for a bunch of courses on Udemy (How to become a web developer from scratch, beginner PHP course, beginner Python course, beginner Ruby course),So you completely ignored the advice?";;
my apologies, i worded that incorrectly...i had signed up for a bunch of courses due to them being cheap at the time...and then heard from commentors on reddit, that sticking to one language is the best way to go.;;
Almost nobody writes things like `startwith`. It's just too hard to read in general, since you can't tell where words start and end. The three most common naming schemes are:* PascalCase: `XmlFileReader`, `StartWith`, `SwapCase`* camelCase: `xmlFileReader`, `startWith`, `swapCase`* snake_case: `xml_file_reader`, `start_with`, `swap_case`Different languages have different conventions. For example, C# uses PascalCase for class and member names, and camelCase for local variables. Python uses PascalCase for class names and snake_case for everything else. Best to follow conventions so that your code will be consistent with the standard library and third party code.There's sometimes inconsistencies. I think it's a stupid move on the part of the creator, but you'll just have to deal with it. Python seriously suffers from this problem (not to mention the mixing of iterative and OOP conventions with `len(list)` where most OO languages would do `list.length()`). Scala, on the other hand, is very consistent.;;
Well python write them like that. For me, Ruby naming is quite inconsistent without good reason for it. Please correct me if I am wrong.;;
"I don't know Ruby well enough to say (my extent of using Ruby is merely to answer a few questions here), although the fact that they named their ""print"" statement ""puts"" says a lot about Ruby's naming things.";;
Great answer, thanks! :D;;
I think it's pretty consistent at least by the style guide. https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide#naming;;
We don't really know the context so hard to say.   The best type of dynamic array would be one that you wrote specifically for your application.       Don't know why you think void pointers will slow it down.  Personal opinion: don't use macros. They will become a headache if you decide to modify how it works in the future.;;
If you have an array of void pointers it will slow your application down because each value in the array will (probably) be allocated on the heap separately.;;
Are the elements of variable size?    Memory allocation in C is very fast.  I wouldn't let that impact my decision unless it is clear you need the absolute speediest implementation possible.  Fastest and generic are generally mutually exclusive, btw.  ;;
Well... Not when using macros........;;
"What are you storing?  It's hard to tell if you really want help with that answer.      A good solution depends on knowing what you are storing.  A dynamic array can be as simple as:    type *a = calloc( num, sizeof( type ) );         if x >= num             num = someNewCleverSize             a = realloc( a, sizeof( type ) * num)        a[ x ] = typeThing         Just wrap in a few functions and Bob's your uncle.     If the element size is dynamic, create an array of pointers instead and allocate the contents.  Your realloc then just creates more space for pointers.  Add some bits to free up memory as needed and you're good to go.";;
Right now I'm thinking of using macros also because I need to use strings, however I could just have two separate data structures for strings and arrays.;;
Making blanket statements about performance is rarely useful.If you are doing many inserts and deletes then, yes, heap overhead may become measurable.If, however,  you have a large array that you want to sort,  then swapping pointer sized elements may be quicker than swapping structures.Until you know that something is a performance bottleneck, don't worry about it.In 99% of projects,  micro-optimisations like this are completely unneccessary.;;
Are you sure you understand what it's doing?  It's certainly possible to make an array where the elements are contiguous but accessed/manipulated by void pointers (since C doesn't have templates).;;
C# is a great one in my opinion. The forms designer in the .NET languages is super helpful for beginning programmers and C# is really well supported and widely used, however if you have experience in Python I would probably continue forward with that. It's super relevant, widely used, has a hugely helpful community, and about 234098234 libraries and frameworks out there to work with (Django being a big one). It's kind of a matter of preference, but I would continue forward with Python.;;
Awesome, thanks for the feedback! I think I'll have a little foray into C# (just to get at least some understanding of it) then look at expanding on my Python knowledge long-term.;;
Sounds like a plan. I love C#, personally. I work with the .NET languages all the time, and C# has a lot of really good features and nice syntax in my opinion. You can download the express edition of Visual Studio here https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx with a microsoft account, or if you have a .edu (student) email address, you can download the full version of Visual Studio from Microsoft Dreamspark;;
Brilliant, I've downloaded VS 2015 RC for now and just coming to terms with it, thanks again for your help!;;
It's generally better to use the full range of HTTP verbs when possible. That way, you can minimize the amount of URLs you need to create (want to delete a resource? Instead of having to send a POST request with data or call some alternate URL, just send a DELETE request). The other advantage is that it gives you more flexibility -- you have a wider range of primitives to work with instead of trying to stick everything inside a GET or POST request. (For example, if you have GET, PUT, and DELETE, you almost design your API to act as a map -- the url is the key, and you can retrieve a resource with GET, replace it with PUT, and delete it with DELETE, and use POST for when you need to do extra stuff).That said, since GET and POST were the most popular options for a long period of time, it can sometimes be a bit more convenient to just stick to those two -- for example, I believe jQuery has `get` and `post` methods, but no `put` and `delete` -- you need to use the `ajax` method and do a little extra work if you want to use those two.;;
">I believe jQuery has get and post methods, but no put and delete -- you need to use the ajax method and do a little extra work if you want to use those two.What? jQuery uses ajax. You'd use something like:    $.ajax({        url: 'foo/bar',        type: 'DELETE',        // ...    });This will work in all the remotely modern browsers, and thus can be effectively considered supported everywhere.";;
"Right -- like I said, you need to use the `ajax` method in order to send PUT and DELETE requests. In contrast, you can use the following shortcuts for GET and POST:    $.get(""/my/endpoint"", function(data) {        console.log(data);    });    $.post(""/other/endpoint"", {""foo"": ""bar""})        .done(function(data) {            console.log(data);        });It's a small shortcut, and the ajax method isn't really all that longer, but I know that there have been times where I've personally been really lazy + have been biased towards using GET and POST just so I could type fewer characters, which is why I brought it up as a potential factor.";;
Ah, I see. Didn't know there was `get` and `post` methods. I could have used those in my last job.;;
"Use what you need to.  There's no sense in implementing DELETE for a route if the entity cannot be deleted.  More significant is publishing documentation so consumers know how your API is shaped.As for PUT and POST, I'm curious how your textbook is positioning the 'debate.'  PUT is used to update an existing entity; POST to create an entity that does not exist.  ";;
"What do you mean by ""main class""?";;
"public class HelloWorld {    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println(""Hello, World"");    }}";;
That's the main **method**. Conceptually speaking, a _method_ is a **function** that's part of a class. In this case, part of `HelloWorld`.;;
"Is the whole thing the main method or just this bit? public static void main(String[] args) {    System.out.println(""Hello, World"");}Does the initial HelloWorld class, with the main method have any significance over a (random class)duck created class I create? Should it be treated differently? ";;
"No. The class could be used for literally anything. You just gotta have a main method somewhere in your program to run it. You could place it inside your Duck class and still use the class inside the main method like any other class. Usually people move the main method to a class of its own and give it a name like ""Program"" or something so that other people scrolling through your code can easily find the entry point of your program.";;
No, just that bit is considered the `main` method. It's also worth nothing that the `HelloWorld` class itself has no special significance -- it might contain a method named `main` with a specific type signature, but otherwise it's exactly the same as any other class.And in fact, you can have multiple files and classes in your program that all have `main` methods, and unless you explicitly call them, they won't do anything special. To be more specific, what Java will do is when you instruct it to run a class, it'll check and see if it contains a 'main' method. If it does, it runs it. If not, it gives an error. If you wanted, you could create multiple files/classes with main methods, and instruct Java to run a different class (and it'll check to see if it has a main method, etc...). ;;
What language are you using?Traditionally (read: in C) the function *main()* is where the program starts executing.;;
Java. I know that it is where the program starts. But as its a class its a blue print of an object? Perhaps I am looking where I don't need to look.;;
Then, as others have said, it's similar to C.There is no 'main class', there is a main function - the class it's in is irrelevant, it acts only as an entry point to the program.Does it make sense now?;;
Also of note is that there can be multiple main methods. You could have one in every class, if you wanted. To choose which to use as the entry point, you'd use `java my.package.ClassName`. IDEs should have some means of choosing the class to use, too.It's also possible to have entry points without a main method. Eg, Android doesn't use main methods. Similarly, the JUnit unit testing framework allows any test class (with the appropriate annotations) to be run directly.;;
I understand thanks.;;
"Depends on the language.  In Java, for example, everything is an object.  C++, on the other hand, is an object-orientated language which allows some code to be written without using the OO approach.So - 1) what language are you talking about, and 2) What do you mean by ""main class."">Are all objects things ? are some objects actions?Good question.  My opinion is, all classes should be things.  IE, nouns.  Actions are methods on a class.Now to consider your ""add two numbers together"" example...  The best implementation really depends on what exactly you're trying to do, but for a construed example:  Maybe you make a ""NumberAdder"" class - ""NumberAdder"" is a noun, a number adder is a thing which adds numbers together.  You could then make a variety of methods on that class that allow addition to occur.";;
Thank you very much you have answered my question. I am using Java. Below is an example of what I mean by the main class(just hello world). This seems to be the wrong term. If you could please tell me what the correct term is I would be grateful.http://codebin.org/view/5918b2d9;;
Which language? Could you show a bit of your existing code for a bit of context?;;
It's in Java, I added my code to the description. I have the for loops I used to populate each array. I checked those and they work. And I used selection sort on the array of course averages. But I just don't know how to do that and get the associated names and other scores to switch to the correct positions too.;;
If your arrays are all of the same size, when sorting your `courseAverageArray` in the `sortArray` loop, move the elements of all the other arrays as well (instead of only the one array passed to the method).;;
Personally i think your current Design is good and better than the one you want to implement. ;;
That's good to hear thanks. I am self taught so I am still experimenting with design and all that. SO I always try to think through a new design as completely as I can.;;
I would actually recommend learning Java from a book. Like Ektastrophe says, Head First Java is a great book for getting started. I learnt Java programming from Head First Java myself. However, if you prefer learning online, I recommend learnjavaonline.org because it is interactive. ;;
Okay I'll check those out! Thank you! ;;
"Nothing I know of that's explicitly like CodeCademy for Java. What I might suggest instead is a good book (""Head First Java"" is pretty easy to track down and usually costs about $25) followed by the exercises on CodingBat once you learn how to write methods.";;
I have used a book for a little bit but the only problem I find is I find my self just copying the book and never really learning anything, is there something I'm doing wrong?;;
"Copying from the book is the first step. Then go back and take a look at it; take notes. Use comments to explain your code. See if you can figure out what each line of code does. Try finding a new way to write the same line of code. Try modifying it.Ultimately, the thing to do is play around with it, albeit at least sort of methodically. You won't irrevocably break anything. You won't hurt anyone. Worst case scenario, you'll have to go back and copy the code out of the book again and/or you'll maybe waste an hour or two.(Later, you can learn how to use Git to help make it much easier to recover from borking your entire code base. For now, the ""undo"" feature works just fine).If you want something a bit more methodical, [Learn Java the Hard Way](https://learnjavathehardway.org/) is also a fine resource. It's much more limited in scope than Head First Java, but that tightness of focus also helps a bit. The first 16 chapters are available for free so you can try it out. By the time you finish up Chapter 34 or so, you should be ready to tackle CodingBat's exercises.";;
See your comment makes complete sense. But I get this feeling of dread when I try to do that method because I simply don't know any other way to do something. I am limited to the knowledge of what I have learned previously. I want to be able to mess around or try new things but I don't know all the syntax and stuff so that's where I get frustrated. I feel like a monkey not a programmer in progress. I can only copy. ;;
"How is that different from codecademy? You get better by practicing, books can be helpful because they have problems for you to solve at the end of each chapter.> I want to be able to mess around or try new things but I don't know all the syntax and stuff so that's where I get frustrated.Sites like codecademy don't let you try new things, you have to type everything exactly how they want it.

You don't need to memorize syntax to be a ""programmer in progress"", as long as you're able to solve the problem you can always look at the documentation to see what the syntax is. ";;
Okay I see where you're coming from, I'll try to look at some of the problems. Any tips on how to work on getting the problems when you're new and not really used to breaking down problems? ;;
The book should tell you what you need to know unless it is a crappy book. Don't over think the problem. If you're on chapter 1 and it tells you to print x y times, it's not expecting a loop. If you're learning for a class look for an old syllabus and try to get the book and go over the stuff the syllabus says.;;
Copying is fine at the very start, but you need to do the exercises. A couple of exercises from each chapter will be useful. For books without exercises, you should play around with the code you just learned. Eg, if you learned how to use a loop, then you'd try utilizing that in a few ways (eg, print out the number 1 to 100; keep asking the user for a number and adding that to a sum; etc).

A really nice thing could be if someone built a test harness for operations on cards against a defined interface on standard in/out that way people could tdd modelling a card deck in any language using the same harness;;

Correct, I am not using a GUI. Just writing some lists, dictionaries, and classes to build/manage what can be done with the deck. Then calling it from the interpreter.;;

"Doesn't ""Think Python"" (or is it ""Think Java""?) has such a running exercise throughout the book?";;
Not sure, I’m using the Learning Python book by Mark Lutz.;;
A nice exercise: for a set of poker hands determine which are the winning ones. Simple, but non-trivial.;;
Good idea, but it does get tricky quickly.  There are many ways to model playing cards, and they have different implications.  The best way to model cards in computer memory isn't necessarily a good representation of how they work in real life, and this can be extremely confusing for a beginner.  The first aggregate data structure you encounter in most languages is an array. Arrays (typically) have a fixed size, and the size cannot be changed during a run of the program.The way humans uses playing cards is more like a stack, which is a more complex data structure often not taught until later in computing. I give an assignment in my CS1 class where I have students model a set of playing cards with a very simple integer array, and it's amazing how many ways they over-complicate the exercise.  Before you understand stacks, the best way to do this is not to store an array of cards at all, but to store an array of card _locations_.The other thing that confuses people is the nature of card names (Three of clubs) leads you to think cards should be a two-dimension array.  While this often makes sense, you should be good at single dimension arrays before you go to 2D, and you can always use some simple math tricks to determine a suit and rank if you know the card number.;;
I started making a basic card game in java the other day, and i just used a list. ;;
I kinda did this last year with my students, and found the exercise fascinating. Here's my stab at it with JavaScript: https://github.com/Glutnix/CardDeck/blob/master/CardDeck.js;;

Somewhat related, you can do some pretty interesting things if you use prime numbers to model the card rankings: http://suffe.cool/poker/evaluator.html.;;
Are you trying to take instructions in natural language and turn them into a technical specification, or take the specification and turn it into code?;;
Nah, i want a language to formally describe the specifications and then automatically process it to get something compilable/runnable. No natural language processing, that would be too insane =).I know that there's UML which can possibly be used for formal description of anything. But it's graphical, and i am not sure it's a good idea to base a code generator on such a thing. Or am i missing something here?;;
Basically you want a declarative language, which declares what you want and not how to get it. SQL is an example. Although the sheer complexity of this means that anything non-trivial will require some pretty abstract SQL code (in that it doesn't really represent the specification in a readable way).And SQL's declarative nature also makes it limited, which is why languages like pl/pgSQL (PostgreSQL's procedural language for database interactions) exist.SQL as a language also only works because there's an enormously complicated DBMS (database management system) that interprets and executes the SQL.;;

"Alright, let me put it this way.Let's say we're developing an Android app. The user story is ""i want an app with a single screen which has an edit box and a Send button, so when i press the button the Email app opens, with the email text being pre-set to what was in the edit box"".The system i want to have would transform it into the declaration of a proper layout, definition of the activity and instantiation of the proper intent.To do it, i must first define the rules, by which the user stories are translated into the intermediate technical instructions, and i need a code generator itself to produce output text files (classes, manifest, resources etc) based on the technical instructions.The question is: are there any software products aimed at providing the tools of creating such rules?If the example i made didn't clear things for you, then i don't know what else to tell you regarding your question. Because if all this doesn't ring any bell to you, then my question is probably for someone else to answer ;).";;
It sounds like you want a DSL that covers layout and program logic.  What benefits do you think this will have over programming an android app normally?;;
It's not gonna be just a DSL for layouts.And the point is that once you create a proper framework, i.e. that specification description language is rich enough to describe any user story imaginable, the application development only requires a spec to be written down - the rest is automated.Which includes the use of proper patterns, the platform quirks that are easy to forget or mishandle, and other stuff.;;
So what exactly is your question?;;
Sorry about being vague, I would like to know how I can make this happen (Bigger image and text appears when someone clicks the thumbnail in mixitup)How can i create the appearing and changing part? (Sort of like an image gallery thing);;
The easiest way is to put all your images on top of each other and hide all the others except for your active image. Then when an image is chosen, you set the new image's opacity to 0, show it, then animate their opacities. That's easy with CSS transitions.;;
Alright man i'll try it that way, but wont that cause the page to be super slow since it has to load all the images on load?;;
Yes, but my suggestion was a basic one to get you started in the right direction. If you wish to download the images only after you click on them, you can just fade out the image (css transition on opacity) and the text element, then fade them back in with the right image sources and text when the download is complete.;;
"Again, **headers are for declarations only**. The entire purpose of their existance is to declare functions and variables that are defined in .c source files. That's why they are not named .c but .h. They way you have it all your files should be named .c.The structure of your code is very confusing. There is a function called `genQuestions()` which apparently does everything except ask the initial two questions. It also takes two parameters `rAnswers` and `indicator` which are always 0; one is never used but is reused as a local variable, the other is only passed on to the function `answerQuestion()`, which also doesn't use it but reuses it as a local variable, which it sets once and then never uses again. At the end of `genQuestions()` you also print the return values of `answerQuestion()` and `reply()`, both of which unconditionally return 0, and that's why you get two zeros printed in your output.Explain what your thinking was with these things.";;
I am still very new to the c language, so I am doing what made sense to me. *RAnswers* and *indicator* are supposed to be passed between the files as a sort of global variable that is like how the variables *difficulty* and *response* were used.;;
But they're not global variables, they're function parameters. You are just passing the value 0 in at the start. `genQuestions()` never uses the value of `RAnswers` that was passed in, but sets it to a new variable. Then you pass the new `RAnswers` to `answerQuestion()` along with the same 0 you got in `indicator` to begin with.`answerQuestion()` never uses the value in `indicator`. It just sets it to a new value, which it also doesn't use.Also, `answerQuestion()` never communicates anything back to genQuestions(). It always returns 0, and in any case all you do with the returned value is print it. So `genQuestions()` doesn't find out about whether the answer was correct.Then you call `reply()` without any parameters, but `reply()` actually takes one parameter, called `indicator`. So you have undefined behaviour there. If you were to call it as `reply(indicator)`, you would simply be calling it with the same value 0 that you received from `main()`. `reply()` doesn't have a case for 0, so it wouldn't do anything.You should probably change your functions so that the values they return are actually meaningful. For example, `answerQuestion()` could return whether the answer was correct or not, and then `genQuestions()` could use that value as the parameter for `reply()` to tell it what to print.`genQuestions()` is a pretty bad name, by the way. Something like `playGame()` would probably be better.;;
Well then I don't know what I need to do in order to pass the proper variable values to the right functions. the name for genQuestions is a required name I have to use.;;
> Well then I don't know what I need to do in order to pass the proper variable values to the right functions.Define what information the functions need to have in order to work, declare those parameters, pass those parameters.So, does `genQuestions()` need the 0 it gets passed as `indicator`? I would say probably not, given that it is always 0. Does it need the 0 passed to it as `RAnswers`? Certainly not, because it changes the value of that variable without ever looking at the value before that.On the other hand, doesn't `reply()` need to be passed a parameter? It is declared as taking one parameter, so it certainly must be passed some kind of value to avoid undefined behaviour. If you fix your code up so that you have a header with declarations for all the functions that you include everywhere, the compiler will refuse to compile because of that missing parameter, pointing it out to you. You should probably be passing some value returned by `answerQuestion()`, indicating if the player answered the question correctly or not.That brings us to a more important point: Define what information it is that each function is supposed to provide to the caller. What information is it each function *produces*? That is what they need to return, and the caller needs to do something with it.;;
"Well, in `main` you are printing the return value of `genQuestions`, and `genQuestions` always returns&nbsp;0, so that will print&nbsp;`0`. In `genQuestions` you are printing the return values of `answerQuestion` and `reply`, and those functions always return&nbsp;0, so those `printf` statements will print&nbsp;`0`.The return values of your functions are not meaningful, so don't print them. Just *call* the functions—don't call them and then print the return values.";;
How would you suggest editing the code then, because I don't understand what you my by just calling them. When I do not include the return 0; the compiler gives me an error.;
"    printf(""%d"", genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator));You are calling the `genQuestions` function there and then sending its return value to `printf`. You don't want to send the return value to `printf`, because the return value of `genQuestions` is always&nbsp;0, and there's no reason to print&nbsp;`0`.Just call `genQuestions`:    genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator);And if you aren't going to do anything with the return value of `genQuestions` anyway, then why is it returning anything at all? There's no need for `genQuestions` to return&nbsp;0 if you aren't going to ever do anything with that value:	int genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator)	{		/* ... */		return 0;	}Why does `genQuestions` return an `int`? What is the meaning of the integer it returns? The integer has no meaning—it's always&nbsp;0. So there's no reason to return anything at all. Declare `genQuestions` to be `void`, meaning that it returns nothing, and take out the `return 0;` statement.	void genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator)	{		/* ... */	}";;
That fixes the issue of printing zeros, yet now the output is just this:* How many questions for this test (1-20)? 2* * Select difficulty (1-4): 1* Question 1: 6 - 10 =* Enter Answer: -4* Question 2: 2 + 1 =* Enter Answer: 3;;
"Well, why do you expect it to print anything between the first ""Enter Answer"" line and the ""Question 2"" line? Exactly what line of your code do you think should be printing something there?";;
I am expecting it to call on the function reply and tell me whether or not the answer was correct.;;
What do you mean? Point to the place in your code that you think should be doing that.;;
In the function *genQuestions* it calls upon *answerQuestion* then *reply*, and what I was looking for those to do is print out the question, check to see if the answer is correct, then tell the user if it was correct or not.;;
"You call `reply` in `genQuestions`, but you don't pass any argument to `reply`. The `reply` function requires one argument, because you have declared it as    int reply(indicator)which should probably be    int reply(int indicator)but you aren't giving it an argument when you call it. That means that your program has undefined behavior, which means that you have absolutely no guarantees about the behavior of any part of your program.If `reply` requires one `int` argument, as you have declared it, then you need to pass it one `int` argument when you call it. You can't call it as `reply()`, because you aren't giving it an argument there.Apparently the `reply` function should be passed the integer 1&nbsp;or&nbsp;2, depending on whether the user's answer was right or wrong. How is the `genQuestions` function supposed to know whether the user's answer was right or wrong in order to pass `reply` the correct argument? It can't know, because `answerQuestions` doesn't return any useful value. The `answerQuestions` function assigns a value to the *local* variable `indicator`, but that variable disappears when the `answerQuestions` function returns. If you want `answerQuestions` to pass a useful value back to the calling code in `genQuestions`, then you need to have `answerQuestions` *return* some value, and you need `genQuestions` to *save* that return value by assigning the return value of the `answerQuestions` call to a variable, and *then* you can pass that value as the argument to `reply`.Note that your `reply` function does absolutely nothing at all if the argument `indicator` is a value other than 1&nbsp;or&nbsp;2. It may help you to understand what is going on if you include an `else` block in that function to print out some other message (and possibly the value of `indicator`) in case `indicator` has some other value.";;
So I found that the problem is that I have been returning the value of indicator back to *genQuestions()*.;;
If a function does not return a value, it needs to be declared to return void. If you declare it to return int and then don't return a value, then the compiler will probably complain, because this often indicates that you intended it to return a value but forgot to;;
You need to declare the types of your function parameters.    int genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator)    {        /* ... */    }What types are `difficulty`, `response`, `RAnswers`, and `indicator`? Are they `int`s? If so, you need to declare their types like this:    int genQuestions(int difficulty, int response, int RAnswers, int indicator)    {        /* ... */    }Likewise for all your other functions.I am surprised your compiler is not warning you about this. Make sure you are turning on all warnings when you compile your code, and pay attention to what the warnings say.;;
Why are you posting this in /r/learnprogramming? Ask yourself: is your question about learning to program?;;
maybe you should ask yourself: why am i a dickhead? /r/learn2benice;;
Her Mr/Mrs/Ms DJ, sorry if that offended you. I was merely trying to convey to you that you're posting totally inapropriate question for this subreddit. It is very probably the reason this submission is getting downvoted.You didn't answer my question though.;;
There's no right or wrong answer, it totally depends on your reasons for learning a particular language, how much time you have to work with, how highly you are prioritizing it, and what your particular goals are.;;
The goal is to learn how to program. If you have made projects and you are confident that you can make more but feel that you be able to learn faster by using a feature of some other language then maybe it's a good idea to switch.For example, you've been learning C++ and are feeling pretty confident because you've made several interesting console apps. You want to start making GUIs and so you want to switch to C# to use WPF. That sounds reasonable to me.;;
Thanks that's a really good answer ;;
It depends on what language you're learning. Let's start with that.;;
We can't really help you without seeing how your project is set up.  Have you successfully built the project?  Are you 100% sure you're running the right executable?;;
http://imgur.com/YnNxlCVI have ran the first project successfully but then when I run the Tutorial 2 project it seems like it is still running the Tutorial 1... it is really confusing.;;
When you make changes into your program you have to build it again, and then run it. If you just run it, it'll use what was previously built (the Hello World code).;;
That wasn't the problem. It was the fact that Visual Studio thought they all needed to start at once. I quickly resolved it after looking through the properties.;;
"Solution: Go under Solution properties, Common Properties, Startup Project, then mark ""Current Selection"". ";;
You need to build the project. It's likely looking at the default setup;;
> No php, never php.But SOAP is where it's at!;;
"You need to be much more specific about what you wish to learn.  ""Web services"" is a very broad topic.";;
I guess I'm so overwhelmed by the subject that I barely have any idea what I'm talking about. I have XAMPP running a mysql DB. I want my web service to expose that from that DB. Like java app A calls web app asking it to query DB for key X, and the web service to return a SOAP object containing the result. Don't know what else to say. But I have no idea how does this work, non, nothing, nada. Don't even know where to start.;;
"OK... so first, a sidebar: notice how generic your original question was, compared to how specific your goals and requirements are.  Thinking about a problem in terms of ""how can I accomplish X"" is going to be more effective than ""I need to know all kinds of stuff about web services...""Moving on - consider just loading up a web page, say Reddit, in your browser.  Your browser makes an HTTP GET request to a on Reddit's web server.  Reddit's web server eventually returns a bunch of HTML, which your browser then renders as a web page for you to look at.What's the difference between that, and a web service?  Very little actually.  A web service works in a very similar way - except instead of returning HTML intended to be rendered in a browser window for a human to look at, a web service more commonly returns specially formatted plain text (often in a format like XML or JSON), intended for another application to parse.I'm going to assume you've done some PHP programming since you apparently know enough to dislike PHP.  So consider a PHP script that just spits out XML instead of HTML - congratulations, you've just made a web service!That's the basic idea - from there, you'd want to look into things like handling different HTTP verbs (GET vs POST are the most common, but there are others can you leverage.  A simple rule to follow is that GET web services are used for reading information out of your database, while POST web services are used to write data back to your database.)  How you setup your URL schemes to reflect the data model you are working with.  Authentication and security.  Etc.  But, in general, if you're used to doing ""traditional"" web development (in terms of HTML/CSS/JS, etc) - most of the concepts you encounter in web service development map back pretty cleanly to traditional web development concepts that you are probably already familiar with.In terms of how to make web services - pretty much any language which can be used for traditional web development can be used for creating web services.  Many languages even have a variety of built-in and 3rd party libraries and toolkits that can be used to abstract some common patterns in web service development.  Just google your language + ""web service development"" for a plethora of frameworks, examples, tutorials and references.";;

The cause of the implicit declaration error here is that you've used the same header guard word for all your header files. So when myfunctions.h is included, MYFUNCTIONS is defined. Then genQuestions.h includes answerQuestion.h - but because MYFUNCTIONS is already defined, the #ifndef is not evaluated - so the #include statement doesn't actually include anything, which is why it later complains about answerQuestion not being declared.You need to use a different header guard word for every .h file - using the filename in all caps is usually fine. In addition you should not put the implementation of functions in a header file - header files are for declarations only, the implementation should go in a seperate .c file. The use of header guards prevents this problem from showing up in this case, but if you had more than one C file and they both included the same header, you would get an error due to multiple definition of the functions, since the function definition would be included into both files.;;
Headers are for declarations **only**. That's what the difference is between a .c file and a .h file, the whole point of the different kinds of files. What you do is you put all your functions in .c files, and then you declare them in one or more .h files. Then all you have to do is to #include the right .h files when you need the declarations.;;

It's as if Symbolab got a bit retarded. When it applied a * (b/c) = (a*b) / c, he did - * (1/3) = (- * 1) / 3. But x * 1 = x, so - * 1 = - Therefore (- * 1)/3 = -/3. And -/3 is basically -0/3 = 0. It seems to be a problem with the exponent. It's weird though...;;
Instead of just complaining you should give an actual alternative (such as http://coursera.org or https://teamtreehouse.com). Now you're just whining.;;
I think the better alternative is 'www.automatetheboringstuff.com' it teaches real used of programming and explanation is concise and easy to undestand compare to codecademy. :);;
You are not using codecadamy right. They have all the answers and work arounds in the forums (which is one click away from the editor). ;;

I disagree with this because Codecademy teaches you how to start coding. It's not for people who already know how to code and want to learn new syntax.

I don't agree with this answer. OP will more than likely need to generate html dynamically with a server side language, in this case PHP. We're here to help, not tell people they're wrong and can't do it. ;;
You could use a switch statement to achieve this. Using the page name, or other variable to determine which link has been selected, you can then assign an active class to your HTML element and set a custom include file dependant on the case. The page would need to be reloaded for this to work. It can work without reloading the page but you would need to use Javascript. ;;
Thanks so much for this answer. I'm new to coding, so forgive me, but do you know what parts of js I'd need to use? If I know what it's called, I can Google it from there.;;
You'd need to do this in javascript. Can you provide some psuedo code of a simplified example of what you're trying to do exactly? And what is the actual problem you're trying to solve? There may be an easier way to do this. ;;

Instead of printing the palindrome when you find it you just stuff it into a var. At the end of the process when you visited all the numbers you just print the var. Since you go from low (100) to high (998) the last one will always be the largest. ;;
okay i did this with list thinking i could pass max function to it but for some reason it prints the second largest instead of the actual largest. makes total sense but no sense at the same time.    def palindrome(): 	s = 0	l = []	f = [0]	highest = 0	def checker(n):		c = str(n)		if c[::-1] == c[:]:			c = int(c)			l.append(c)		for i in range(100, 998):		s = i * i		checker(s)	print(max(l))okay i was looking for the max in list of strings i just converted the palindrome back to integer then did max fucntion. thanks for the help everyone in this thread!;;
It's because you're storing the strings, not the numbers. And then max compares them alphabetically instead of numerically since max has no way of knowing that you want them to be compared based on number values. So just change l.append(c) to l.append(n) so it appends the number instead of the string.;;
"Your current print statement executes on every item that makes it through that 'if' statement (essentially, every item that is a palindrome).Instead of printing each item, think about how you can collect all the palindromes into the same container so that they can be compared by length later.Or alternatively, think about how you can check each palindrome as you receive it to see whether or not it is longer than any of the other palindromes you have recieved. This way, you don't need to store every palindrome you find; only the current ""king of the hill"", so to speak.However, by nature, your program works from lowest to highest, therefore the last palindrome you find will be the largest one.";;
"> double unitconv(double x, string y)> unitconv(value, unit);Why are you ignoring the returned value from the function call? unitconv returns a double, yet you don't do anything with it.";;
"yes now i realize my mistake, at first i was under the impression that once the compiler reaches the function call; it compiles the function body, THEN return/assigns? the value of (x) to the variable (value).i didn't know that the compiler needed to assign the returned value to a different variable. actually i'm still having trouble understanding it.";;
This is a weird analogy, but think of a function like a teapot.You put water and a tea-bag in the top (arguments) and tea comes out the spout (return value).In your case you made the tea but forgot to pour it out.;;
u know, now that i thinking about it, that makes perfect sense. ;;
I'd love to see your teapot analogy extended to include pointers and references ;-p;
I think it works well because you shouldn't pour tea out the top of a teapot - you'll make a huge mess.;;
There are few cases in modern c++ where you should to modify a variable passed by pointer/reference. Just return things, using tuples if needed.;;
[I should buy some tea.](http://i.imgflip.com/tau4.jpg);;
It sounds like you were thinking with pointers, essentially.  If you'd used pointers, then your function could have changed the values at the pointed memory locations and you wouldn't need a return value.I notice that you also set the value of unit term in your if-else blocks even though that information never leaves the function.  As it is, that does nothing, but using pointers, that behavior wouldn't be so pointless.;;
post your code ;;
i added a link, to Ideone.com cause the code is a bit long. and it's against the rules;;
Haven't messed with c++ in a while but try adding return statements in your if statements. ;;
i did actually, the compiler still ignores the whole function.;;
"You're not actually using the return value of unitconv(). It looks sort of like you're passing in ""value"" and expecting unitconv() to change it, but you're not passing by reference, so it won't. Try using the return value of unitconv() and see how that works.";;
i'm sorry i'm not sure i understand, in the book the author quickly skipped through the Functions section. is it possible if u could comment the correction you'd make to the code?;;
"On line 48, do something like:    double result = unitconv(value, unit);and then use ""result"" for your calculations after that point, instead of ""value"".";;
that worked perfectly, thank u my good sir;;
Glad I could help!;;
"it would've made more sense to put it this way though    value = unitconv(value, unit);";;
That could cause problems later on.  If you wanted to display the measures in their original form, you would have to convert back.  It's also helpful for code readers - value is the input, result is the input converted to a standard unit.;;
The function looks syntactically correct. Are you using a complier where you have breakpoints? Maybe check to see what the values of your variables are before passing them to the functions? ;;
i'm using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 ;;
I'm no C++ specialist myself so correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't multiple return statements considered bad practice?;;
I'm sure it's bad practice. Like I said, I havent used C++ in a while ;;
Not really, no. It's certainly not something I would worry about at this stage. ;;
Some IDEs actually warn you if you have a function that reaches the end without being void. I use Xcode (Mac only) and it does tons of nifty things like that. The IDEs by Jetbrains are supposed to be really good and are multi-platform.;;
That book is not very good. A lot of exercises weren't clear for me either and I'm so glad I switched to C++ Primer 5. Edition.;;
You probably want to make a call by reference in your fonction. What you are doing is simple put: You are copying the values modify them delete them again. and use the previous values again.;;
Pretty cool! I don't have enough C experience to comment on the code and it's style (and it's kinda lacking in comments) but you really should add at least a readme showing what it does. Expected input and output. This would make it a lot more accessible for recruiters / people that might interview you.So add a readme that shows how to build it (you should include a makefile!), how your virtual CPU works and what the instruction syntax is.;;
Cool!  This doesn't look half bad.  Some random comments:* Identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter are reserved, so you can't use the name `_Instruction`.* I really don't think you should be defining `_MSC_VER` yourself.* Lines 53-64 of `parser.c` look suspect to me.  You're copying over all of `buf` into an array of 50 characters, and then terminating it at the first space.  Why not just copy up to the space (while checking the bounds, of course)?* On line 67: you know the size of `ins_table`.  Why do you need a dummy member on the end to tell you when to stop?* Sometimes you declare all variables at the beginning of the function, and sometimes you declare them in the middle.  It isn't all that big a problem, but I'd try to be more consistent.  (Is this C89 or what, by the way?)* Lines 358-364 don't make much sense.  Why are you breaking on every iteration of the loop?More in general:* You've got a lot of variables called `pch` and `temp` and such.  I'd look into giving them more descriptive names.* You seem fairly inconsistent about error checking.  In a language without exceptions, I'd be doubly wary of this.  You should indicate somehow that a piece of code still needs to have error-checking added, or that you for some reason choose to assume no errors will happen.* You should compile with more warnings.;;
Thank you for the response!I am defining _MSC_VER because of MinGW. I primarily use GCC as my compiler on Windows. I used to think that MinGW did not implement a lot of Windows APIs at the time which were actually implemented, the only problem was _MSC_VER had to be defined to a higher version. I guess I just made it a habit, even though I use no Windows specific API and try to be as portable in most of my code.Lines 53-64 of **parser.c** I can explain. Basically, x86 assembly has a limit on how big an instruction it can be, ASCII wise the instruction can be pretty long I suppose, but I figured 50 bytes would be enough for the longest possible instruction which can be written in ASCII. If not, the limit could always be increased.Line 67. When I was writing this I had taken a different approach, it was only then that I learned how to implement the same thing with a statically initialized struct. And I will be frank, that for loop, I still am not quite sure how it works. Because you are incrementing a pointer byte by byte, or so I am led to believe. At some point any byte not 0/NULL should match pins_table->ins. So I must definitely read up on this.I always code in C99, the code is therefore less strict about some things(defining a variable within a for loop). I make use of automatic variables, i.e they get created and destroyed on each iteration, that is simply how I've gotten used to declare them, perhaps bad practice.Lines 358-364 - I break because each comma separates instructions(or operands in an instruction), once I've processed one, I must go to the next.;;
"> I used to think that MinGW did not implement a lot of Windows APIs at the time which were actually implemented, the only problem was _MSC_VER had to be defined to a higher version.The point of `_MSC_VER` is so that your program can tell what version of MSVC++ you're compiling with.  If you're not compiling with MSVC++, it shouldn't be defined at all. If you do need to define it `undef` it ASAP, or you can screw up other libraries.> I figured 50 bytes would be enough for the longest possible instruction which can be written in ASCII.In that case, you need to validate that it's a valid instruction before you copy it over.  It's input provided by the user; when it comes to this, you should assume the user is malicious.> I still am not quite sure how it works.Basically, you go through the `instruction_table`s until you hit one that's got a zero as its `ins`, and you've specified beforehand that that means that it means ""there are no more valid `instruction_table`s"".> perhaps bad practice.It isn't bad practice by itself, but you need to be consistent.  If you're willing to make use of this, why are you defining `pch` so early in `INS_parse`?  (Personally, I prefer giving everything as small a scope as possible.)> Lines 358-364      while (foo) {         // stuff without break or continue         break;     }is equivalent to    if (foo) {        // same stuff    }";;

Is CelShaderPlugin a project that you created?  It looks like you aren't linking the lib where all that stuff is defined.;;
Can you give an example? I've included all the right header files, or so I believe, and added an include path to the project.CelShaderPlugin is the project, CelShaderVolume extends PostProcessVolume. I've included the header file for PostProcessVolume, should that be enough?One of my main questions is around inheritance. Say we have Classes A, B and C that all inherit from each other.Do I need to include any headers for Class C to use methods in Class A if Class B already did that? If Class B doesn't declare or implement something (say both A and B are abstract), can C see the virtual methods from Class A?;;
"No, including header files is not sufficient to satisfy the linker. You've told the compiler that those functions exist but that doesn't pull in their definition.For a normal VS project, you do this by right-clicking on the project, go to ""properties"" and then linker -> input -> additional dependencies.  You need to know the name of the .lib file that contains all the UE code.  I'm not sure if UE4 has some special setup but it should be covered in their documentation.If class B inherits from class A it does not need to reimplement any functions that are defined in class A.  You're probably running into these issues for the same reason as above - the actual code for class A's functions is in a .lib file somewhere that you need to tell the linker about.Another possibility is that you're expected to add all the UE4 .cpp files to your own project. That would be unusual.  But again, this should be covered in their docs.";;
Exactly right! Now that I know what to look for, I found this: https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Linking_Static_Libraries_Using_The_Build_SystemGoing to have a crack at that now.;;

I started typing a reply, then found [this Wiki article whose overview explains what is happening better than I could](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_\(Java_method\)).

R is a programming language that is used for a variety of purposes, with working with statistics and mathematics probably being some of the more popular uses of the language. R and its libraries provide a great amount of functionality, including the ability to create graphs and other graphics, perform a variety of mathematical functions, and much, much more. There are also third-party libraries that can be downloaded and used, for a variety of purposes, as well. Here's a [link to the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) on the R programming language, where you learn more about it and its uses.If you're going to learn R, you will have to download the R programming langauge, which you can do from the official [R Project website](http://www.r-project.org/). Additionally, you may be interested in downloading and using an IDE for writing R code, with one option being [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which can be downloaded and used for free.Regarding tutorials and other resources for learning R, you can probably find a variety of R tutorials online, in both text and video-based format, with some tutorials listed below.http://www.cyclismo.org/tutorial/R/http://www.r-tutor.com/http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/Having been required to learn a little bit about R for a class I took on Big Data, I can tell you that it is pretty powerful when it comes to performing statistical and mathematical functions, as well as for generating graphs and other representations of data and what not. However, the syntax of the language kind of differs from languages like Java, Python, etc., though I'm sure you could get the hang of it pretty quickly with some practice.Best of luck and I hope I helped you!;;
Thanks. I'll check the links out.;;
How do you want to compare them? Can you give an example?;;
"I have an array of numbers (transitions) and a string. I want to see if a character in the string is equal to any of the numbers so I have:            for(int i = 0; i < transtions.length; i++) {               if(transtions[i] == string.charAt(0))                  return true;            }";;
Gotcha.Each character is assigned a unique ASCII or Unicode number. For example - in ASCII - [the char 'A' corresponds to the decimal number 65 and the char '0' corresponds to decimal 48](http://www.asciitable.com/). So you do not want to do this:     if(transtions[i] == string.charAt(0)) /* This compares the                                            ascii number of the character to the integer                                    not the actual value of the                                    integer the char represents*/In Java, you can compare a char and int the way you describe in a couple of ways:You can use the Java Character class and use the getNumericValue() function like so:        if(transtions[i] == Character.getNumericValue(string.charAt(0)))or you can do it the old fashioned way and add the ASCII value of '0' to your character. This addition will return the actual integer representation of your character:    if(transtions[i] == (string.charAt(0) + '0')All of that makes sense?;;
Yeah thanks to much for taking the time to help!;;
That's what we're here for. Good luck with the rest of the code!;;
"You could cast the char to an integer then take 48 away.    String test = ""5"";    System.out.print((int)test.charAt(0) - 48);";;
"Well, I don't speak java but I bet something like     char b = '1'    int a = 1;      if (Integer.toString(a).charAt(0) == b) //do my thing";;
That works but it's really inefficient. Chars are just integers with ascii representations of the number so you can simply cast a char to int and substract 48 to get the integer value of the char. ;;
" You wrote your objective out in plain English in the comments. A good next step would be to write it out in pseudocode e.g.    check to make sure both arrays contain at least one element    while the index of the current element in obj1 is not     greater than the size of obj2        for (counter = 0; counter < obj2.size)            if obj1[current element] == obj2[counter]               this element is not unique, move to next element            else                this element is unique; save it in another obj                 to return later   That is not a complete solution but it will get your gears turning. One other hint:    obj1.arr[aCounter] < obj1.arrSizeThis line is checking if the object pointed to by obj1.arr[aCounter] is less than the size. I think you mean to check if aCounter itself is less than the array size.";;
"I would do it like this:For each element in obj1.array, compare with all the elements in obj2.array, if it is unique, then add it to the result.array or some temp data structure.Some pseudocode:    for (int i = 0; i < obj1.array.size; i++)    {        for (int j = 0; j < obj2.array.size; j++)        {             //Compare elements here.              // What should I do:             // 1. If they are equal?             // 2. If they are different?             // HINT: use a variable as a flag        }       // HINT 2: check the variable 'flag'      // If flag == something, add the item to the result.array      // else discard that element.     }There're probably better ways to do this, but this is the simplest, at least for me, to do it.";;
if the array is sorted you probably only need 1 loop if it is not sorted you need 2 loops. Then compare the elements and if the elements are the same, you do nothing otherwise you save it in another array. in the end you return the array/vector, and you are done.;;
"The (terse) definition of a string is an array of characters. You should be able to just exchange each char[] for a string type. That make sense?EDIT: In fact, in C++ you can also do something like:    char myArr[13] = ""Hello, world."";    string str(myArr);";;

Somewhere, you are printing the address of an element of a string and not the element itself.

Line 108 is very wrong. You can't compare against multiple values like that and you don't even need to.Your big if elseif elseif block would look better as a switch like you did later.  ;;
I began attempting to rewrite the if else block as a switch but got caught up in sorting out the more functional problems. Thank you, though, I was wondering if it was worth rewriting that piece.As for line 108, I did that to get around ceil(0.0) producing 1.0 rather than 0.0 as I needed. I will revisit that, too.;;
In trying to rewrite it I have encountered a road block. Switch can only be used where the case is an integer and the contents of the string zipcode which is being evaluated is made up of characters.;;
case '1':case '2':is perfectly legal.  A char can be promoted to an int.;;
"How would I implement the switch being run through for every character in zipcode? I tried enclosing switch(zipcode[i]) in a for loop to iterate through i but I get the error ""switch quantity not an integer"".";;
If zipcode is a std::string then that should compile.  zipcode[i] returns a char& which the compiler can promote to an int.;;
I have simply declared the strings as string. What do I need to do to ensure it is a std:string?;;
If the git repository you linked to earlier is current then    string convert(string zipcode[])is wrong.it should be     string convert(string zipcode)or, better,    string convert(string &zipcode)since you are just passing a single string to it,   not an array of strings.;;
Thank you again! I think I have everything worked out now except for the if else block which sets the checksum to the proper value at line 91. What I am trying to accomplish with that block is to take the sum of the digits of zipcode and set checksum equal to the number you must add to it to get to the next tens place. I know there's a better way of wording that.;;
You don't need floating point or any tests for that.(sum % 10) is the remainder you get when dividing by 10. Ie it gives you a number you can **subtract** from sum to give a multiple of 10. (sum - (sum % 10)) is a multiple of 10.You can do 1 simple thing to calculate the number you need to **add** to sum to get a multiple of 10;;
I see it now. I can just change it to: checksum = 10 - (sum % 10)As I was describing another issue I managed to fix it, and then another. It seems I'm all [finished](https://gist.github.com/Octoquake/1592c36add385f84ca8a) up.The other issue was having to reset zipcode to '\0' after running the program, otherwise it would print previous barcodes, too. I did so with a for loop running through zipcode to set it all to '\0'. Is there a better way to do this?;;

Thats a pretty complex program, I would recommend to start with some smaller goal for right now because you most likely will give up and quit once you realize the work that is involved.;;
ou're asking for something that's relatively complex, certainly so for a beginner to programming. You aren't getting any answers because there's no reasonable answer to your question. We can't give you a walkthrough for a full fledged app.Here are some basic things I suggest you accomplish:* You said you already know some Java. I suggest continuing to work with. Refresh your knowledge of the language.* Learn about the BSD sockets API and some basic aspects of networking. Understand what TCP and UDP are, and what TCP gets you (it's quite a bit). Resources often show C code, but you are mostly focused on the concepts.* Pick an API or library for your programming language that allows you to handle networking concerns. For example, the OS provided BSD sockets API for C, Boost Asio for C++, nio for Java, etc.* Work your way up to a point where you can have a client and server application communicate text messages with each other. That means the clients can open and sustain a connection properly, read and send efficently, and shutdown gracefully.If you get up to this point, and still don't know how to further proceeed, ask your question again.;;
I didn't know how to ask the question when I have .01% of the knowledge i need to accomplish it. I have an idea of how much work it'll take, thanks for the advice to you and everyone else.;;
As others have said there's one hell of a lot of learning to do if you want to do this.I don't know exactly what you want it to do, but you could think about making a plugin for an existing VOIP system like Mumble.;;

You'll either use a VPS or a managed host. A VPS is presented to you a barebones server that you manage. You'll have to setup all the software and configure the system properly.Nitrious.io is not a host.For practice, setup a server on your computer in a VM. You should do so anyway for development purposes, before replicated on the production machine.You really should use a web framework. A lightweight framework like Flask will work.

All of the numbers between 2 and the argument being compared against the argument?The i is short for ""index"", which is sort-of a placeholder. In the for loop, the i is evaluated in line 5. Each time you hit the ""end"" on line 6, the ""i"" value goes up. It keeps going up and keeps getting evaluated each time until you hit your end condition, which in this case is ""2..**n-1**"">line 7: ""end"" The only end I'm sure about here is the one at the end closing the method as a whole. I have no idea why there are 3 others. 1 to end the code block within the method sure but 3...um what? Is this some type of nesting? A method within a method? It seems like the latter half of the method that starts on line 9 is a new code block. Why the separation within the same method?In ruby, each time you use an if statement or for loop, you must signify when it ends. The end on line 7 signifies the end of the if statement (line 5). The end on line 8 signifies the end of the for loop (line 4)>line 9: ""if is_prime"" Equates to either true or false par lines 3 and 6 from earlier. Confusion abound. If is_prime is true, the code goes along to line 10. If it's not true, the if statement fails, and it proceeds to the else on line 11. ";;

"I strongly dislike how popular claiming ""Imposter syndrome"" is here on this sub. Chances are that if you really think you're really a lot worse than your coworkers as in that you have no idea what they're talking about then you don't have imposter syndrome; you just don't have the experience / skills they do.Imposter syndrome is about two equal parties where one feels he's worse than the other while in fact they're equal. I see tons of juniors here claim imposter syndrome while in fact they just really lack experience. Telling them ""it's impostor syndrome"" is damaging to them because it leads to inaction; telling them they should keep learning is a much better approach.";;
"I don't think you go into it thinking eventually you'll be saying stuff like ""Hi my name is perfecthashbrowns and I've been impostor-syndrome-free for 30 days now."" You just focus on improving your knowledge and skills. Hopefully it goes away eventually! But in my case, it started out really bad and then I stopped experiencing it and then got it again and now I'm a lot more confident about my skills. So maybe that's how it will go for you. But really try not to worry about it and focus on improving yourself. It's not very helpful to harp on something like this so much. ";;
I think for a lot of people, it goes away as they interact with more and more people in their field and realize how incompetent everyone else is.  As for the people who are actually incompetent relative to their peers, they either don't know that they suck, or they try/do and get better.;;
To be honest, how much imposter syndrome effects you depends on your surrounding environment. When I am in school, I have the opposite of imposter syndrome. I know I am a better developer than a large majority of my classmates because I invest a lot more of my time into projects, reading books/blogs/news groups. But during my internship terms, imposter syndrome kicks in and whoops my ass hard. Generally you have a good idea of where you stand in respect to others.;;
"True. An analogy I can think of is when you are playing lego, you learn many types of lego bricks; the curvy one, tall one, short one, special character one. You combine two bricks and it works well. But it should not end there. You need to use all lego bricks you have to build structure; a castle, parking lot, anything that you can think of, anything that serve your purpose. Programming languages and concepts is like lego blocks. You need objective and purpose as well as understanding to glue them up together to build a structure, that is your project.";;

So much this. If you write a piece of software and start to notice that it's not performing as you'd like, you can always hook up a profiler and try to work out where it's wasting time.

Good quote.  Never heard it before but it makes a ton of sense.;;
A sorted list is still a list type. And as far I can see from the [code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/listobject.c#L402-412), it's always a linear search. So a sorted list still incurs O(n) cost.;;
'in' calls \_\_contains__ and for lists it's O(n), the list doesn't know it's sorted. if you want you can use bisect module to do binary search and insertion on sorted lists. if you don't need the properties of a list you can just use a set instead which is O(1) for lookup.;;
"> Does the ""in"" keyword benefit from a speed boost due to the list being sorted?No.  It doesn't know that your list is sorted, and always performs a O(n) linear search regardless of the contents.  You can use functions from the `bisect` module to perform a binary search, but don't.> is there a better version for checking for membership in a sorted list than ""in""?Don't use a list, use a set.  Sets have O(1) membership testing.";;
Okay, so I didn't know about sets.  Which would be faster... using a set, or maintaining a sorted list (adding via bisect) and then using a customized operation to search with bisect?I'm making some very large lists of urls here, so speed matters a lot.;;
Yes, of course.    >>> seen = set()    >>> seen.add('http://foo.example.com')    >>> seen.add('http://bar.example.com')    >>> 'http://foo.example.com' in seen    TrueEdit: in response to your edit: Sorting a list is O(n log n), binary search is O(log n).  Adding to a set is O(1), lookups/membership testing is O(1).  For large amounts of data it's not even close.   Here's 10 million items:    >>> import random    >>> data = [random.randrange(0, 1000000000) for _ in range(10000000)]    >>> item = random.choice(data)    >>> dataset = set(data)    >>> data.sort()    >>> %timeit item in data    10 loops, best of 3: 159 ms per loop    >>> import bisect    >>> %timeit bisect.bisect_left(data, item)    The slowest run took 7.31 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached    1000000 loops, best of 3: 947 ns per loop    >>> %timeit item in dataset    The slowest run took 14.41 times longer than the fastest. This could mean that an intermediate result is being cached    10000000 loops, best of 3: 83.6 ns per loop;;

If your a beginner the concepts are the same and it most likely won't matter.;;
It's fine. I wouldn't recommend to use any book that doesn't cover Generics.Generics where introduced in Java 1.5, which is the version covered by the Head First book, so you're OK. Most of the other new features you can pick up later.;;

So think of it this way. the class is the blueprints of an object it knows how to build an object but isn't the object its self. When you make an object you tell the computer to look at the blueprints and make an object like that and name it what you state. self is just saying the object your currently programming when you call self. if you want I could try and help you vocally its easier to explain through dialog in my opinion.;;
What is a blueprint?;;
instructions on how to make something.;;
Alright, so the class is an instruction on how to build an object> class Blueprint(object):This sounds like this: Here are the instructions of the object:I think I got this part, but I am not sure about the functions. Like there can be a function like this : > def stuff(self):I understand that between parentheses there are function parameters, but why is there a self? What does it do? Something seems different in Python.I am also not sure where I should use classes.;;
I'm not too familiar with Python. But in every language Ive worked with you can use self to reference variables that are instanced and can't be accessed by other things. Are you familiar with any other language I could try and write a simple example for you and explain it to you.;;
C++ is my primary and first language. Would be appreciated if you gave me an example.;;
"    class Person {      private:        String name;        double height      public:           String getName(); // Member functions        double getHeight();    }So think of it this way with this I have a person class which is a general thing and I can make a new person named GoodLittleMine with a height of 65.0 the class is the concept where the object is specific and holds data.Now for self. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the ""this"" keyword for C++ but it is the exact same thing it is a reference to this object or its self where it can see everything in it opposed to other objects who can only see public declarations.";;
Thank you so much, it's much more cleaner to me now. Self refers to this , so it's a keyword, and yeah I am kind a familiar with it. Everything is clear to me now, big thank you!;;
Ya no problem man I was confused too when I went from Java which uses this to Objective C which uses self so I can see the confusion.;;
"I don't blame you for being confused; this example you are following is lousy. In fact, the internet is littered with lousy OOP tuturials or explanations, perhaps in part because OOP is in such common usage.Here's what worked for me: http://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Thought-Process-Edition-Developers/dp/0321861272I heartily recommend this book if you are trying to understand OOP.";;
This is something you should be able to do with nearly any programming language. No particular language is going to be uniquely suited for this task.However, if you're a beginner + have not yet picked a language, a good language to start with might be Python -- it has a relatively low learning curve + is commonly used as a teaching language, so you're likely to find tons of good resources for it -- see the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq) for more info.;;
Does my problem sound like it would be a good project for a beginner or is it something more complex? Just want to ensure that I'm not out of my depth here.;;
Mm, I guess that depends on you, and how quickly you learn.That said, the problem seems reasonably attainable to me. You're probably going to run through a tutorial first to pick up the basics of whatever language you chose before you can fully tackle the problem, but that won't necessarily take a long time. Once you begin writing your program, you may find that the solution isn't immediately obvious, though you should be able to solve it with some researching and careful thinking. (Your problem description is basically a slight twist on a classical CS algorithm, and so is definitely solvable.);;
Fantastic - Thank you for your help. I'll give Python a shot!;;
http://www.iups.org/media/meeting_minutes/C.pdfthese guys wrote the language.  It's concise and terse, but super informative.  If you can read an understand this in 2 weeks, you may have a shot.  It's a long shot, but who knows?;;
I sincerely appreciate the information.  I will give it a look!;;
The question could be more specific about their requirements, but check the 'Tags' for some hints on what they really meant.;;
Maybe having the return statement inside the loop, i.e.    def containsDuplicate(self, numsArray):          duplicateExists = False          for i in range(0,len(numsArray),1):                for k in range(i+1,len(numsArray),1):                     if numsArray[i] == numsArray[k]:                           return True                return FalseThis method will exit the loop (and the method) and return the value True.;;
Hum, good point.  Let me see what kind of time that saves...Right now, it is taking about 2 seconds for the large array of ints they are sending to it, that it is erroring out on.;;
It is a lot faster than it was, but and it past that packet of data they were sending it.  It is not complaining again that it is too slow on another packet they are sending it with thousands of ints.  See this Gist:https://gist.github.com/anonymous/60b9dcfda809d8062b74;;
This is probably too big of a hint, but check out [sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets).;;
There is a rather efficient way to do that:     def is_equal(sorted_data):        for i in range(0,len(sorted_data)-1):            if sorted_data[i]==sorted_data[i+1]:                return True        return False      is_equal(sorted(data))Sorted probably uses a quicksort. quicksort scales mostly with O(n*log(n)) the additional linear comparison doesn't matter.;;
"You can do this on average in linear time (O(n)) using a dictionary (not intuitive but the fastest possible time complexity). The operations [""Get Item"" and ""Set Item"" are both on average constant (O(1)) time](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) for a dictionary. That means for each number in the list you can use it as the key to index the dictionary. If the get item succeeds that means the number is already a key, and thus we have a duplicate. If it fails we do a set item with the number as the key. Essentially the set item says ""this is the first time I've seen this number"" and the get item says ""I've seen this number before"".Code is short and sweet:    class Solution:        # @param {integer[]} nums        # @return {boolean}        def containsDuplicate(self, nums):            d = {}            for n in nums:                try:                    d[n] += 1                    return True                except:                    d[n] = 1                    return False";;
Partial application allows you to bind some arguments of the function and create a new function with those bindings (this is related although different than currying). This is incredibly useful from the perspective of code reuse, for example. Your example is not very complex, but imagine you needed to make a makeTriple, etc function as well.;;
you're mostly taking about the partial application aspect of currying, there is no advantage in terms of abstraction it's just far easier to write.;;
"Posting a link to an executable is useless. Post code.With that said, we don't need to see code for this. Basically, you want to figure out what variables need to be saved and later restored for the game to work. Once you've identified which those are, you'll need to figure out how to save that data to a database. It's noteworthy that a database is a little unusual for a game save. A good starting point for a game save would be to directly serialize data or use a format like JSON. A dictionary is often the data structure of choice for simple save files.There's a lot of room for optimizing the save format, but that's unnecessary for such a simple game.Anyway, when you save, you'll ""simply"" write all the variables that you previously identified to this file (eg, by adding them to a dictionary and serializing the dictionary). The hardest part is likely getting all the data you need into the save functionality (since this data is likely spread around the program).Loading is the reverse. Deserialize the file and set the appropriate variables to the values from the dictionary (again, you need some way to access the places where the variables will be set). You then must figure out where to start the game. Eg, a simple platformer might simply load the level that the player should be on (a more complex save system might place the player at a specific position, etc).";;

"Please try and use better titles in the future. Mention your specific problem (""best logic"" is vague and meaningless) and language.

Once you figure out how to shift characters, can you figure out how to build a string with the shifted values (hint: lookup `StringBuilder`)?";;
"OP, did you google ""java Caesar Cipher""?There are plenty implementations.Also, it's against the rules of this sub to give you a complete solution as this is not /r/domyhomework.";;
Get a char array of your string, then add the shiftValue to each of your characters, then create a new string from your array.;;
"On line 11, you can just keep String codedText; you can omit ="""".I know in C you can treat chars as integers, so doing something like char a = 'a'+1 will resuly in b. Note that it follows the ASCII table. I'm not sure if you can do the same in Java, I never tried, but I think you can.I'd suggest breaking down the string in a char array and shifting them one by one. You'll have to handle chars whose ASCII value is ('a' value)+(shift value)>26, so you'll have to start again from 'a' instead of keep going forward.";;
In Java it's essentially the same, only that the `char` datatype commonly represents a Unicode data point.;;
AI and machine learning doesn't require any specific languages. I would recommend you use whatever you are most comfortable with.

Honestly I'm a little confused on what exactly you want to do, but it sort of sounds like you're wanting to use a neural net. Are you already familiar with neural nets?;;

I believe you can go to github and find it there and start playing around with it and teach it to recognize some objects. I'm really new to programming as well but I'm sure doing it from scratch and by yourself would be a huge headache if your not acclimated to programming in general.;;
Because Python is frequently used as a language for researchers (and technical folks who don't have a CS background), there are some really excellent resources for machine learning and AI in Python. If you don't have any CS knowledge yet, you'll probably need to spend some time building up your fundamentals before you can tackle AI, but this is alright.That said, pretty much any language can work just fine (though some will work better than others if your needs are more specific).;;

Get a different programming job!!!!!!!;;
One of the issues is I can't leave my job. I have to be here for at least 3 more years;;
Write something you'll use. Learn a different language. Read some books.;;
Find a job at a bigger company where you will be exposed to more complex and varied projects, and can work with more experienced and knowledgeable coworkers.;;

There are programming meetups in most cities and they often consist of networking and a guest speaker who will talk about a new technology. It's a great way to hear about what's new and out there.* Go to Code Camps or conferences. Larger conferences can be expensive, but if you're work has an education budget use it. Code Camps often provide a similar level of expertise for low cost or even free. In my area  , Los Angeles, we have a few code camps with excellent speakers for free. The LA Code Camp is a two day completely free conference.* Follow people on twitter. Find expert developers and follow them.* Get a pluralsight subscrition and watch courses on new and interesting things.* Go to hackathons and build stuff* Do exercizes on coding site. I like http://codingbat.com/, http://www.codewars.com/dashboard. Some of the problems may seem easy, but it's about practicing.* Look up Coding Katas and do them. There are a ton. This is my favorite one and I've done it in over 10 languages as a way to learn. http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/Google programming katas and find stuff you like.* Do Koans. There are a lot of neat programming Koans. The Ruby koans are excellent and here's one in pythonhttps://github.com/gregmalcolm/python_koans* Just code for fun. The project doesn't have to something new or revolutionarty. In fact, it's better if it isn't. Because you already know how it's supposed to work and can focus on buliding it. Build a reddit clone, a face book clone, a todolist, whatever.;;
Double check how you're passing the variables to your tempAndSpeed function. ;;
As soon as you said that, I realized my error. Thanks!It is still giving me the same error for windchill though, I am trying to figure it out :/;;
"In C++, all variables are passed *by value*. That means that when you pass a variable into a function, the variable is copied. Any changes you make inside the function affect the copy, not the original variable.Therefore, your tempAndSpeed function does not actually alter the variables in your main() function; only the local copy which is discarded when the function returns. Therefore the variables windSpeed and temp are uninitialized.If you want the tempAndSpeed function to initialize those variables, you have to pass a *pointer* to those variables, rather than just their values. You can then modify the values of the variables in the main() function through the pointer.";;
oooooh. I actually had it tempAndSpeed(double& windSpeed, double& temp)I changed it, and I should not have doubted myself. I understand those errors now, but it's still saying that my windchill variable has not been initialized. ;;
In the windchillFactor() function, you pass windchill in by value, but do not use it - again, you probably meant to pass a pointer.However, you also return the calculated windchill factor from the function, so there's no need to be passing it in as an argument - I would just remove it from the argument list altogether, and that should work.;;
Okay, I see now. I moved it to be only a declared variable inside the function, and my code works!Thank you so much for your help.;;
Have you heard of references?;;
Oops, forgot this was C++ and not plain C ... they're basically the same thing internally though.;;
> they're basically the same thing internally thoughNope.;;
Aren't they? So how are references implemented? I thought they were basically pointers with some additional restrictions imposed by the compiler - I didn't realize they'd generate different machine code.;;
How something is implemented is irrelevant.  References and pointers at the language level are quite different.;;
As I understand it, references don't need to be explicitly dereferenced, can't be null, and can't be altered once created. But I would have thought that in the final compiled code, you'd get the same thing, though I guess the extra information might allow the compiler to make some additional optimizations that it couldn't have made otherwise? I don't really know that much about the implementation of C++ though, so I could be completely wrong.;;
"Consider:    int x;    int &rx = x;This does not declare two variables.  It declares one variable with two names.  It does not declare an int plus some kind of pointer that's automatically dereferenced.  A pointer that's automatically dereferenced would be a second variable, because it would have to store an address.  A reference doesn't do that.  It's an alias for another variable.  In *some* cases, yes, such as passing parameters to a function, the under-the-covers implementation acts similar to a pointer that's automatically dereferenced if you squint hard.  But references aren't just used for passing parameters.Among the other differences, references have different rules for type deduction contexts.  And a reference can bind to an rvalue, but a pointer can't, as you can't take the address of an rvalue.  And so on.";;
OK, thanks for the explanation. I didn't consider the case where the reference isn't being passed anywhere - I can see why that would not require indirection to implement, since the reference can't be altered like a pointer. As I said, I'm not too knowledgeable about C++ - I prefer plain C myself.;;
"    ""p{}"".format(x) = GiftClass() Doesn't make any sense. You're assigning an instance of a class to a string literal.";;
Yeah, exactly. But I'm saying I don't know how to do it because when I tried using eval(), that didn't work.;;
I don't really understand what you're trying to do.;;
I'm trying to create an instance of the GiftClass for each person in a group with an arbitrary number of people.;;
So add them to a list.     people = list()    for i in range(0,number_of_people)        people.append(GiftClass());;
Ah, thank you. That works perfectly.;;
You're welcome. The class approach isn't bad...But the easiest way to do this is just to have a dictionary keyed by names.    people = dict()    people[name]=amount;;
Yeah, after thinking more about the actual problem and actually trying to code it, I've seen that a dictionary would prove more useful because if I use a list it looks like I'll have to do a lot of iteration as the problem states that the test input file will provide some random names and I'll have to give money to those names. But all part of the learning process. I wouldn't really understand the advantage of certain data structures without doing these problems.;;
Exactly. The effect is the same but a dictionary is much more convenient and makes more sense here. Once you decide on that the rest is a little math trickery and managing reading lines.;;
What are you trying to achieve with this line? Also, avoid eval(). If you find yourself needing to use eval(), you almost certainly have the wrong approach.;;
What in the Christ are you doing here?  This wouldn't even make sense in Java...  Do you not understand how to use Maps or hashes in Java?  It looks like that's what you really want here, but for some reason decided to use a class instead and you still aren't willing to use the appropriate data structure despite seeing this clearly makes no sense.;;
"Come on, I'm just trying to learn here. I'm not ""unwilling"" to use the appropriate data structure. I just couldn't come up with the right approach.";;
Ignore the trolls you're doing fine.;;
Come on, you mentioned the right approach in your original post, ffs.;;
Will you be publicly sharing the results?;;
Yes. At the very least I'll come back here and post whatever interesting things shake out of the data. This is also something I'd like to structure a conference talk around, and if that happens, it'll be public as well.;;
Are you talking about unit testing? ;;
Any sort of testing whatsoever. I tried to make the survey very open-ended.;;
Few of us do it religiously? If I found out a programmer where I worked didn't test something I'd recommend they be terminated  immediately. ;;
Big upvote. I'm still a beginner, but learning and using testing has made making projects a lot easier, and I never get into a situation where adding a new feature breaks an old one.At an old job we had a single developer on staff making a new workflow software for us. After about eight months, each one of his new features broke an old one. I asked him for advice on learning unit testing and he said 'testing is pointless I never do it.';;

How much time do you have?  Something like that for a beginning programmer is, just a guess, at least a couple months of full time work.  For someone that is really experienced in this it might only be a week or two depending on the level of integration needed.I'd suggest you keep searching a while longer for something out there that is already available and suits your needs.;;
I have an insane amount of free time while my visa paperwork gets processed. At least a month. If I can't find anything out there I guess I could attempt it. Thanks for the help.  ;;
Someone else mentioned how long it would take to do on your own.To hire someone to create this would be quite expensive. The issue is that skilled programmers are not cheap and freelancers have a higher hourly rate. There's no way to say for sure how much it would cost since I don't know how large this is, but it could easily be several thousand dollars. Most likely a relatively simple quiz done entirely client side (if you don't need to save results or anything) could be a couple hundred.You could possibly save some money by having a student write the code. It's riskier, though, since code quality may suffer and there could be serious bugs (although this is really a problem no matter what). Could even be very affordable if you use one of those Indian programmers on a freelance site. Some of the prices they charge are almost too good to be true (which also makes it risky).Point being that the cost can vary wildly (especially depending on exactly what you want done) and the cheapest choices are very risky. Programmers don't have the same standards as you might expect from a mechanic or something.This is totally doable yourself, though. You'll need to learn JS and likely CSS.;;

That's a nice offer. Thanks (: Any specific questions I could come up with (or not)? Like specific languages?;;
There are no right or wrong questions, ask whatever you like!As for starting, if you have absolutely no experience with programming, I guess the first step is figuring out whether you actually like it or not, trying out some scripting languages like python (which is a nice language, actually), a pseudo-language like scratch or even a  [programming game](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hackedapp). If you prefer to get started with the actual programming right away, you have three main languages categories to choose from: procedural languages (also called 'classic' languages, or non OOP, like plain C), OOP ( Object-Oriented Programming, like Java) or backend languages( also called server-side, like PHP).;;
Yes I am already busy with PHP a lot, as of today I passed to the last year of my course (: And right now I'm trying to learn OOP in PHP, which is a bit hard.;;
I strongly suggest learing an OOP native language for that. Sure, it's nice to know how to do it, but for practical purposes it isn't the tits.;;
What language would you recommend then? I was studying Java at school, but that did not really take my interests.;;
How so? I mostly code in Java ATM and it's a big plus knowing it when it comes to Android programming. ;;
Yeah I've been pretty curious about Android Programming as well. I just have been having Java this year, but I fell really behind and the teacher did not really bother helping me. So yeah. I've also tried learning Java myself, but I had just been struggling quite a lot. I need something that I can use well to learn Java.;;
Well, I'm no teacher, but feel free to ask even the stupidiest questions, I am very patient and I like helping other people ;);
Haha alrighty that is good to know. (: I'm just trying to find out a good way for me to learn Java atm.;;
There are no callbacks in HTTP. A callback usually means that you pass a reference to a receiver that the receiver can call whenever it wants to (some time in the future and/or multiple times). Since HTTP is strictly client-calls-server callbacks doesn't make sense. ;;
That's rather vague, can you be more specific?  HTTP is a network protocol, and doesn't have anything to do with callbacks, which is something that happens in a programming language.  But there are lots of circumstances where callbacks are used in web applications.For example, in JavaScript executing on a browser, the author might want something to happen when a certain element is clicked, so they'd install an event listener for the 'click' event of that element.  This is done by calling a browser interface like `elem.addEventListener` which takes as parameters the name or type of event and a reference to a function to be installed as the listener.  That function is usually written by the author to perform whatever action they want performed when the event occurs.  The browser stores a reference to that function, and when the event occurs, it calls that function.  The function is called a callback because the user is not calling the function, but asking the browser to call it at some unknown point in the future.Another example is JSONP.  JSONP is a way of getting around the same-origin policy of the browser.  Its based on the observation that scripts can be hosted anywhere, so one way of accessing a cross-origin resource (which would ordinarily be forbidden) is to make it into the form of a remotely hosted script which is executed.  (Yes, this is horribly insecure.)  The goal is to pass some data (encoded in JSON), so this script really doesn't have any behavior, it's just a chunk of data.  But it still needs to be in the form of a script, so it's formatted as a call to some user function.  The assumption is that a user has already written a function with that name, so by loading and executing that remote script, that function will be called with the desired JSON data.  So this is another form of a callback.  Often the name of that user-provided function is made into a parameter of the request as part of the query string.  This is necessary since there might be multiple scripts running that all want to use JSONP, so the name of the callback function has to be configurable.  It will often be named `callback`, so if you see some HTTP request for a JSONP asset that has `callback` as part of its query parameters, that's what's happening.But again, who knows.  The idea of a callback is very common and used in many different contexts, so it's impossible to know which one you're asking about.;;
"HTTP requests are initiated by the client and sent to the server; however, there is a concept of ""long-lived"" HTTP connections.  This basically means ""I'll call you now, and you get back to me when you have new information"".  After one cycle of that, the client typically re-initiates a new long-lived call immediately so there is a consistent pipe with which the server may push new information to the client.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology";;
Don't think callbacks and http are mentioned together alot, but I can imagine passing a URL to an external service which then will call you back.With regard to the web, callbacks are also often used in javascript.;;

Java's pretty verbose, so it won't result in less code written, but some other languages (eg, Scala, Python, etc) can reduce the amount of code needed.";;
You should take both, the order doesn't matter.;;
I recommend doing data structures and algorithms before OOP. ;;
Well data structures is going to be useful no matter the programming language. Learning about worst-case time complexity is going to transcend whether you are programming in C, Java, Python, or Perl. I had 1 semester of Java before I took assembly programming and data structures, and when I finally took higher level Java (OOP) programming courses, I was more prepared when it came to efficiency. And thats not to say that taking data structures first, isn't going to teach you OOP because C++ is a OOP language. ;;
Thanks, mate. I am going with data structures then .;;
They're both very fundamental classes. The order doesn't really matter, pick whichever has a better professor at the time or something. If your OOP class requires lots of prior knowledge in data structures, take the data structures class first for a better start in OOP class.;;
Thanks man , Data structures it is ..And the prof is really hot :P;;
You certainly can delete it. Whether or not you should depends, for me, on a few factors:1. Is it named in a way that gets it frequently confused with another repository you own?2. Are you bothered by how much clutter there is?3. Can you guarantee that nothing else depends on it?In general, don't worry too much about the code quality of a repository as a factor in whether you should delete it. Anyone who looks at it and is able to evaluate code quality will also see that the repository was last touched a long time ago, so it's not a big deal.You can certainly delete it if you want. But the benefits of doing so are pretty close to nil in almost all cases (unless you're, say, building something for illegal or ethically questionable purposes, in which case you might see a large benefit there). It's probably easiest to keep it around and not worry about it, especially if there's even a tiny chance that you might return to it for some reason.;;
I say if you ever linked to it from another website, don't delete it. Say you're having a conversation with someone about your repository and you reference it, someone else who views your conversation may want to see the repository for context.;;
It's cool of you to want to teach, but be careful not to teach harmful things.For example, you're suggesting people store passwords in plain text? Also, I'm quite sure you can't use sessions without `session_start()`. Moreover, I think `if(!$count==1)` does not do what you expect. Lastly, I'm unsure of how safe it is to base someone's identity on a plaintext userid and username stored in a session.Bonus points for trying to avoid SQL injection though (even if you do it with a deprecated function).;;

Great read. Should be applicable to any craft, honestly.;;
I think beginners should struggle to write excellent code because even that code will be ugly.Formatting, separation of concerns, oop, small functions and classes that do one thing only, and of course well named variables should be of the utmost importance. If the code is clean but inefficient, more experienced coders will be willing to demonstrate better techniques.If it is confusing and difficult to read, the experienced dev may give some small bits of advice but they wont want to spend any real time dealing with it ;;

I don't know what exactly the course covers, but usually it's harder to find videos for more advanced topics, which is where written resources dominate. [Beej's network guide](http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) is a well recommended and top notch resource for general purpose network programming. ;;
The type is `uint8_t`, not `unit8t`.Why are you defining `myWriteBuffer` to be an array? Is that really what you want? If you do want it to be an array, why are you putting only one value in it? You cannot assign an integer value to an *array*. That is why you are getting the error message. If you don't want it to be an array, then take out the `[8]`.;;
I'm assuming this is C? You should also give us the error message.Also, it's not unit8, but uint8. That's probably it.;;
Illegal conversion of integer to pointer. ;;
/u/zifyoip is on to something.;;
"1) The type you're looking for is ""uint8_t""2) The error message is telling you exactly what's wrong - you are trying to assign an integer to a pointer. There are very few situations in which you would want to do that, so you need to use an explicit cast if that is actually what you want to do. Here, though, you don't want to make myWriteBuffer point to 0b1110000, you want to write the value 0b1110000 into (presumably the first element of) myWriteBuffer. You can either use an array initializer:    uint8_t myWriteBuffer[8]={0b1110000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}or you can use memset to initialize the array to all zeroes, and then initialize the first element seperately:    uint8_t myWriteBuffer[8];    memset(myWriteBuffer,0,8);    myWriteBuffer[0]=0b1110000;";;

http://www.sololearn.com/Courses/ you should definitely check this site out! I am completely new to programming and I am taking the Javascript course on this site and it's a slow process but its definitely working. its pretty much like a 15 minute video broken into 2 minutes per video and after every clip you will be asked a question regarding the clip you just watch and it will tell you if you were correct or not to see if you are actually paying attention.

I dont think profession is the determining factor in who smokes. There are smokers in every type of job.;;
God, no. Even a couple of beers is enough to turn me from a fairly competent programmer into a monkey with a typewriter. Our office goes out for a pub lunch on Friday, and most Monday mornings are spent cleaning up the mess I made Friday Afternoon.;;

"I used to years ago and thought it helped keeping my mind clear and made coding more enjoyable.  I was lying to myself.Productive coding involves juggling multiple things in short term memory at once (while drawing on past experiences). Variable names, method declarations, implementation details and recent API calls are all kept in short term memory.Pot doesn't have much effect on your *long* term memory so it doesn't have a negative impact on your learnt ability to code.  What it does do is devastate your short term memory (this is fully supported by studies). You will misname variables, fail to re-use, refer to API docs more frequently and most importantly; forget what you were doing later on.It has no place in serious or professional development.  ";;

On line 46, shouldn't you be looping to `rows`?;;
That makes sense. Thanks. Now since I made the int **array a static, would I be fine using that memory in other functions without any problems?;;
Making `array` static does nothing for the memeory that `array` points to. That is memory on the heap dynamically allocated using new; that will be good memory until you `delete` it (which you are not doing now, btw; you should always free any memory you allocate). Making `array` static will make the memory _for the pointer_ (that is, the address itself) persist in memory.

"Define 'practical'.

I've used PHPMyAdmin to run queries on a MySQL database. I'm not sure about accessing an Access database.;;
Dreamweaver isn't really used by web devs as far as I know. By that, I mean I've never seen a professional use it and I've heard only bad about it. I have not used it myself, so can't say how suitable it might be for whatever you're trying to do.This is something you'd usually write by hand, assuming that you wanted a public facing website. It would require some knowledge of basic SQL and any server side language. There's also a number of types of DBMSes (which is what Access is), although for such a basic use, it wouldn't matter too much. I recommend Postgres if you have no other idea about what to use. Postgres also has a pretty simple full text search capability built in, if your search functionality would need that (it would if you want to search for things like articles or reddit posts).And then you can use any plain text editor you want. Sublime Text, Notepad++, Brackets, and Atom are some examples. Or vim if you're a masochist.But if you just want an admin interface to visually see the database, then there's a number of tools for this, all DBMS specific. For example, Postgres has [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/). That's a desktop program, not a web front end. There's probably several web front ends available, but I don't know any well enough to make recommendations.;;
I agree with /u/MadFrand. I don't see what's 'hacky' about using AngularJS on top of a .Net REST back-end. This is a perfectly normal thing to do.;;
It wouldn't be hacky. You would use ASP.NET MVC to return API responses (json) instead of Razor Based HTML templates. Your server-side data models would remain the same.You can still make your Angular pages in Razor Templates. They are not mutually exclusive and serve different purposes. But Angular should cut down on the server generated HTML.You don't need a new IDE or text editor. Visual Studio isn't any worse with JS than anything else, afaik. I haven't used it in years, but you're honestly probably not going to get any benefit in using Sublime/Atom or a Jetbrains product instead of VS.;;
Fair enough. I've actually been using Razor templates in MVC and just setting the Index view to return simply ng-view so it just wraps it in the MVC layout header. But franky this was because that's what the course I was following was doing and not for any reasoning I chose.As it relates to the IDE do you have a suggestion on how to best debug and refactor Angular / JS? Obviously I can do this by hand, but frankly my JS is... ok at best. I find myself having a hard time handling the dynamic typing and so i'll dumb shit like assign a variable / property over an existing DIFFERENT declaration and in C# this would immediate throw an error with a line number. But with JS it just keeps on going until it errors (or worse doesn't error and just doesn't behave as expected) somewhere and then i've got to daisy chain back the functions till I find the offending problem;;

I've had similar issues with Odin project, and Rails in general. It so frustrating to be using a different version of the tools in an explanation and having to spend hours trying to find workarounds that don't break the rest of your code. I gave up on it entirely and am primarily focusing on Android now(I find it a lot more straight forward.) While giving web dev a try, I did find myself really liking javascript, jQuery, node.js, etc. So I'm working on that in my free time with [freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) (I think I may have come to FCC via a link in one of your previous posts!). They claim to teach you full stack Javascript. I just started it this week, so I don't know how true that is, but I'm liking it so far. I know that doesn't answer your question, but it's another thing to consider if you like JS. The only problem I have with it right now is, unless I'm mistaken, a lack of forum or comments. Haven't run into anything tricky yet, but I imagine when things get harder, that's something I'll really miss.;;
did you ever try codecademy? How does it compare to that? I have now heard freecodecamp brought up too many times as an example of a good resource;;
FCC uses codeacademy for a lot of it's exercises, along with udacity, stanford courses, and their own in-browser exercises. I know Odin did that too, but here it seems more specific.  I haven't gotten there yet, but I think most of their later exercises are done in-browser. Take [this](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-pig-latin) for example. Where I feel Odin might kind of throw you to the wolves and tell you to do a bunch of problems, courses etc., with FCC you do one thing at a time and it won't tell you exactly what you need to do, but will give you helpful links to relevant documentation.;;
i will have to test this out! Thanks;;
I'd like to recommend giving the Odin project another try. It's less hand-holding, sure, but scraping by when there's minimal help for what you're trying to do is a necessary skill. It's perfectly alright to be feeling stumped. In fact, if you're not feeling stumped from time to time, you're probably not challenging yourself. If a particular assignment takes all day, that doesn't necessarily mean you're doing something wrong.Keep at it. Try looking for related resources to see if anything clicks. Ask for help (but only after investing time into trying to figure it out for yourself). Try figuring the problem out on paper. Try experimenting with some new things to see if anything does what you need. Try and break the problem down into smaller parts (this is quite crucial for software dev).The reason for this is that the more challenging and less guided environment of the Odin Project better prepares you for making a real piece of software (something Codecademy hilariously fails at). You need to be able to build up the ability to use google to find resources. You need to get into the mindset of solving problems for yourself.If bugs are causing an issue for you, make sure you have learned how to use a debugger (something beginners often seem to skip over -- huge mistake).As an aside, I noticed that the code in your other questions is poorly indented. You should really fix that. I have no idea how the hell you even manage to work with that code. Poor indentation makes the code almost unreadable and readability is important. You really need to be indenting consistently. In fact, I'm gonna repeat myself in bold because you're just shooting yourself in the foot here for no reason: **indent your code consistently**. It does matter. Bad indentation is just going to cause bugs and make it harder to read your code (and you should be reading your code when things don't work as expected).;;
I understand the logic behind your response for sure. Two things: would you recommend running along side odin with something like pluralsight as a visual companion? and B. Can you give me an exact example of code improperly indented and then after that possibly suggest a website / resource for me to possibly learn how to indent properly.;;
>would you recommend running along side odin with something like pluralsight as a visual companion?You could. I would think it's unnecessary and perhaps too much at once, but if you find it helpful, go ahead.>Can you give me an exact example of code improperly indented Note there's a [few different indentation styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style) (K&R and Allman are the only ones used, usually). And then you'd want to indent whenever you have a new block (simplified, you want to indent whenever you have something inside braces). You'd usually indent wrapped lines as well (often twice -- just be consistent).For an example, [here's a well indented file](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/offset.js) in K&R style and [here's an example](https://github.com/MikeHoffert/fbms/blob/master/main/src/cmpt370/fbms/FileChangeHandlers.java) in Allman style.There's no site I know of that teaches how to indent since it's something that's usually pretty obvious once you see it and it can be picked up from example code (I suspect most resources assume that you'd pick up the indentation from sample code).;;
Woah 4 days to cover C and C ++? That's a tall order. If I were you I' 'll focus on the simplest and most fundamental of the two - C. I would get a copy of C programming: a modern approach , read it from cover to cover, and fake it till I make it during the interview. After the interview, I 'll get back to studying C or C++ for years to come.;;
Again, should have been clearer I have 4 years experience with C++, but I will need to just identify any small gaps in my knowledge and fix them/remind myself about them. Thanks for the book recommendation, ill give it a look for sure! But I know all of the basic stuff so I can probably skip a lot of it. ;;
In that case it's different! I still recommend C programming a modern approach, some parts of it are really enlightening. But this also mean you have more time, so maybe you should consider effective C++ by Myers. The book is pretty short and will definitely help with best practices, pitfalls, etc ...;;
"Eh, I guess it's doable, but depends on what kind of C++ you know. Some people know ""C with classes"" and think it's C++. If that's the case, you can probably pick up C quickly. If you know high level C++ (""modern C++""), then there's a bit more to learn.I'd say pick up a copy of K&R. The early chapters can be easily skimmed through. But mostly you'll want to try and implement basic stuff in C to work on your skill and naturally encounter problems. A good such project that can be done in a few hours (or a few days if you know no C) would be a linked list.A linked list can cover:1. Pointers.2. Void pointers (for storing arbitrary data in the linked list)3. Data structures (and particularly how to make them in a non-OO language)4. Function pointers (to search and sort the list)5. Dynamic allocation (since you must allocate nodes)6. Utilizing structsThen try and use your list in an application. For example, ask users for integers until they enter -1, then sum up all entered integers. Your program should work for any number of inputs (assume that the number of inputs will not exceed available memory and that the sum can be stored in an integer or long).";;
Hi, thanks for the reply. I have written both types of C++ if im honest, I wrote code for the ps3 which was very close to C and I wrote code for the RPi and pandaboard embedded systems which was also pretty close to C I guess. A linked list is actually quite a fantastic idea, i have written one in java before so it should not be too difficult and im sure there will be valuable lessons to learn. Im terrified at the moment about the interview as it will be my first programmer interview. I have to travel to London too from Glasgow so I have a fair treck to get there.;;
Any particularly non-trivial C? You're not doing it. Not with any real understanding or comfort, anyway. If you know C++ you can largely get by writing any reasonably simple C program with reference material but, say, if they want an example of a threaded C program with shared memory segments and some direct interfacing with the Win32/Linux API there's just not enough time in an interview to figure that stuff out to the point you can confidently answer questions or do a demonstration.If they want you for a junior position or are expecting you to need time on the job to get into C then good C++ experience should be enough, at least in theory, to get the job. If they want you to know it from day 1, though, I think it's a bit of a lost cause.**If I had to choose things for you to cram on:** ... I can't tell you. What's the job? If you're talking about writing code for the embedded controllers in cameras and shit you should have a very different syllabus as compared to a job developing, say, user-space applications for the Playstation.;;
I should have been a lot clearer in my post, it was a bit of a rushed post. It is more of a junior position, I am fresh out of university, this would be my first industry position and I was honest over the phone in my phone interview and told them I had never written a C program. I have done low level and high level C++ and I have around 4 years of C++ experience. I think I could write simple C programs without tooooooo much difficulty, wrote a few real simple ones earlier today.  I know how structs work but dont have a massive amount of experience with using them beyond using them in 3d graphics applications. So they dont expect me to have extensive knowledge. Its in the R&D department in the testing section of the company. ;;

Take `float sum=0;` out of the loop. Right now every iteration sets sum to 0. ;
Also: `counter` doesn't count, `a` does (from 0 upwards, so be careful).;;
well counter if from a larger part of the program so it value is the number of element currently in the array. its a global constant as it is used in numerous parts of the program. this section of the code is on line 140http://pastebin.com/Bh0dgVhF;;
"Yes, but it seems you want to average the values `net[0]`, `net[1]`, ..., `net[counter-1]`, but (with /u/romple's correction) it actually averages `net[counter]`, `net[counter]`, ..., `net[counter]` (`counter` times), which is pretty much meaningless.You probably want to use `net[a]` instead of `net[counter]`.~~Also, I noticed you declared~~~~const int SIZE = 100;~~~~and used it for your array sizes. In C++ this only works, if your compiler supports so called variable-length-arrays (VLAs) and you shouldn't assume that, because it is a non-standard feature. (In C this would work only in standards C99 or newer). Instead you should use~~~~#define SIZE 100~~**edit:** This only applies for C, not for C++. `const int SIZE = 100` is absolutely fine, sorry about that!";;
">  In C++ this only works, if your compiler supports so called variable-length-arrays (VLAs)This isn't so. This is perfectly good Standard C++:        const int SIZE = 100;        int a[SIZE];as the value of SIZE is known at compile time.";;
Are you *absolutely* sure? [This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18919647/declaring-an-array-using-const-integer) says otherwise, but maybe they added it in recent standards. I'm going to look it up.;;
> Are you absolutely sure?Yes.>  This says otherwiseThe value of the variable is not known at compile time in that case.> but maybe they added it in recent standardsNo, it's always been like that - good C++ practice has always discouraged the use of #define, replacing it with compile-time const objects.;;
I looked it up and you are right.On one hand, arrays do require a constant-expression, but `const` variables which are initialized with a constant-expression (in this case a literal) become constant-expressions.Here's the relevant snipets out the standard:§8.1 (in C++14 standard draft n4140) declaration of arrays:    noptr-abstract-declarator:    ...        noptr-abstract-declarator_opt[constant-expression_opt] attribute-specifier-seq_opt    ...§5.19A **conditional-expression** e is a core constant expression **unless** the evaluation of e, following the rules of the abstract machine (1.9), would evaluate one of the following expressions:* (...)* an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1) **unless** it is applied to (2.7.1) — a non-volatile glvalue of integral or enumeration type that refers to a non-volatile const object with a preceding initialization, initialized with a constant expression.Really hard to read, but this is exactly the reason why a const int in this case really is a constant-expression.;;
To elaborate slightly on /u/exoticmatter's response, the difference is that a mere const like that in your link is not known at compile time. With a literal, such as `const int size = 100`, we know the value at compile time and it can be substituted directly where needed (for most cases -- you obviously need a real variable if you try and take `size`'s address).;;
"Yes, the reasons why a compiler could or could not ""substitute"" constant-expressions are quite obvious. But this isn't about compilers, but about language standards.My initial disbelief stems from the fact, that C handles this differently. In C, a variable is never a constant-expression(*), even when it is `const` and `static` (or global) and initialized with an integer-constant-expression (e.g. 5 or 4+1).In C99 VLAs were introduced, which allowed declarations like `int array[size];` for non-constant-expressions `size`, but in general a constant-expression array-declarations and `malloc()` calls are still preferred for backwards-compatibility (and because of implementation issues of VLAs).You could say I studied the C standard, and the more time goes by, the longer the list of small but sometimes important differences between the C and C++ standard becomes - things like existence of VLAs (which you have in C and not in C++), implicitely converted `void *` pointers, the differing type of `'a'`(`int` in C, `char` in C++) are just the start.Saying ""C is a subset of C++"" really isn't true, and I should have know better than to suggest using `#define` in C++.(*): Except there is the clause ""An implementation may accept other forms of constant expressions.""; but if you for example force gcc to use the C89/C90 standard, it won't pick up on it.";;

"About your current code:You need to initialize your `sum` variable:    float sum = 0;Your `for` starts with `a = -1` and then accesses `net[a]`, which isn't an object and can crash your program or worse. a needs to start with 0.**edit**: ~~Your `for` loops `counter` times, but when calculating the average, you divide by `counter+1`, this needs to be `counter`.~~ See post below.After that, you just have to check what you are actually outputting.";;
"Ok, I took another look at your code.I thought `counter` is the number of elements in your array, but you use it as an index, so it starts out at 0, but the number of elements in your arrays is practically 1.Therefore your average code should look like this:    float sum = 0;    for (int a = 0; a < counter+1; a++) {       sum += net[a];    }    ravg[counter] = sum / (counter+1);";;

Once you have something built and you know what it needs you can then improving adding some front-end fanciness.Front end frameworks (React, Angular, etc) will give you a better UI experience, but it'd complicate your learning at this point. Just use JQuery and you'll be alright at least for the first phase.";;
Thank you. I should probably mention though that I know nothing about javascript either. How/where does JQuery come in?;;
JQuery, IIRC, is used in the Javascript that runs on the client's browser.;;
jQuery is a Javascript library that's used in a lot of websites that makes it easier to add dynamic functionality to your page. If you start wanting your page to do fancy/dynamic/AJAX-y stuff, it's a good place to start.For what it's worth, I agree about front-end frameworks -- and even jQuery. It's cool stuff, but you can do a ton of stuff with just straight up Django and templates. And there's tons to learn there. The frontend is a whole other world.;;
Between jQuery (for some nifty features) and Twitter Bootstrap (for looking good) you really don't need anything else.In fact, just go find a Bootstrap template, and start plugging shit into there. Front end frameworks are a lot of fun, I've recently been playing around with AngularJS, but it's not necessary. Get the site up and running first, then when you're ready start looking into them.;;

Programming a system that would supplant our archaic political system. Fixed my post. Sorry for being unclear.;;
Yes...can you be less vague?;;
[Here is a video that discusses some of the issues with electronic voting](http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_0x6oaDmI) and [here is the associated discussion on Reddit](https://m.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/2ppae8/why_electronic_voting_is_a_bad_idea_computerphile/).The main question you need to solve, or at least convince people that you have solved, is that your Internet Government app is trustworthy at all. Considering how large of a target you'd be, good luck with that. People and governments have dropped multiple zero-day exploits to take over less.This of course assumes one other problem: That any actual government would care. If you can't get the people in power to give over their power to you then your Internet Government is really a glorified version of change.org. If you can solve this then it would appear that our current system actually does work and so why bother making this?So yes, such a thing could be written but you will forever fight a losing battle with attackers who are more skilled and persistent than you while at the same time need to solve the problem you are attempting to solve with a new system from within the old system;;
So do you want to make a voting app or what? For what use?We are programmers. We understand functionality. What does your program exactly do. Computers can do pretty wild stuff. You just need to explain it.;;
Too many big words. Not enough explanation of what you're talking about.;;
You are reminding me of the TempleOS guy just without the racism. Are you all there in the head?Are you speaking of some kind of pure democracy? Just put up polls. Anything else just seems rediculous. I would suppose some places have online voting but for the most part, no, and it's not a good idea either. Not yet. So relax.;;

"I get ""I don't know!"" as the out put. But maybe the problem is with the codecademy website.";;
You always return in the first time through the loop.;;
Use a std::vector.;;
Well it's a project from a summer class I'm taking and I am sure they want the use of arrays over vectors.  But I'd be all over using vectors since my prior research all pointed me to using vectors.;;
>Seems like in C you can declare an array from a non-constant such as a variable. Why have they not implemented this yet in C++ 11? This feature actually became optional (for compilers dev to implement) since C11, because it's got it's own gotchas.C++ doesn't support this feature because it doesn't need to. We have std::vector<>, and it's enough (and actually, it's even more powerful).EDIT: If you can't use vectors, dynamically allocated arrays are what you must use, and I guess that's the point of the exercise. Now using them in real non low-level C++ code is error prone, and usually considered bad.;;
Optimizers and minifiers like min.js are good, because they will remove redundant statements and reduce variable names down to symbols. This will catch trivial attempts at plagiarism.Edit: the out of the box solution to this is just to assign everyone a unique problem. You'll never catch all obfuscation attempts, but you *can* make it impossible to share answers.;;
You could use Linux's diff program.edit: Just found a bunch of stuff by Googling for 'text diff algos', like https://github.com/cubicdaiya/onp/blob/master/scala/onp.scalahttp://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DiffAlgorithm;;
And use `-b` to ignore changes to whitespace and `-i` to ignore changes to case.Then you should be able to identify at least the simplest cases of plagiarism with a quick look at the file (for simplicity, you could say that if a lot is different, there's probably no plagiarism).;;
Look into MOSS. It was a research project designed for this problem and the techniques still seem to apply. ;;
Thank you for direction - I'll google for this!;;
Sorry I'm on mobile and only just realized Googling MOSS is probably not too helpful. It's a system out of Stanford and here is a link to get you started. http://www.quora.com/How-does-MOSS-Measure-Of-Software-Similarity-Stanford-detect-plagiarism;;
I wonder if converting the code into an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) would help.  It seems like it would have a number of advantages:1) Throws away any whitespace and comments.  2) Makes it easier to match up identifiers that have been renamed (or you can even just ignore identifiers altogether to make the comparison easier).  3) Ditto with numeric constants (which I wouldn't have thought about until seeing the rounding change in the sample you gave)  4) Best of all: Since CodeAbbey supports a number of languages, this approach would reduce the language-specific code to just the parsers (which you can always borrow from other projects).And the disadvantages:1) Since you're comparing a data structure instead of plain text, you're probably going to have to cook up your own tools.  No simple 'diff' to make life easier.  2) Similarly, displaying the comparison results will take a bit more work.  If you just dump the contents of the AST via a tree traversal, you're going to get something that's ugly and headache-inducing.  3) It would be easily fooled by reordering statements that lack dependencies, unless you wanted to get clever with your comparison.  4) Some of the information that gets discarded by creating the AST (whitespace, etc.) may actually be useful in finding similar programs, particularly if someone's only manipulating a small portion of the whitespace by hand, leaving the rest of the whitespace as a sort of fingerprint of the original code.Also, thanks for running CodeAbbey.  I've only briefly checked it out, but it fills a great need for a general programming challenge site.  While I also like both Project Euler and CodingBat, the former is way too mathy for general programming interests, and the latter focuses on tiny subsets of programming.  I really like the more balanced approach that the CodeAbbey problem set takes.;;
Thanks for detailed answer - I think I now have enough material to study :) And thank you for your kind words also!;;

Couldn't you work locally, using whichever editor you prefer, and then push your code to Github? That's what I do if I want to work on multiple computers.;;
Yes. If your code is important in any way, shape, or form, you should be using version control. If it's not important, why are you writing it from multiple computers?;;

Very fond of Cloud 9, plus they support github as well as bitbucket for code repositories or you can just save directly in their environment.;;
"Assuming this is Python, read() returns the file contents as a string; it does not print anything.Therefore calling open_file.read() without doing anything with the result does nothing. Try:    print(open_file.read())";;

With just HTML? No. You need some kind of back-end service where the first page posts the data to just so that the second page has some place to grab the data from.So Page 1 (HTML) -> Post -> Backend (any language) -> Page 2 (HTML and JS to poll for new results).;;
What kind of back-end service would that have to be?Like perl or something? I am very very unfamiliar with perl and php... :/;;
You can use pretty much any programming language. Which one do you have experience with?;;
HTML.. and barely. That's why I rather need to find a freelance artist who likes these type of challenges.;;
In that case you should try a different sub. This one is dedicated to learning programming yourself. HTML is not a programming language.;;
When submitting a web form it usually does a POST to the server. You can easily capture this POST using the developer tools of any modern browser.Then all you need to do is write software that does the exact same POST with slightly modified data. Since you didn't specify what language you will be writing this in I cannot help you with that.An alternative is to use something like AutoIt (https://www.autoitscript.com/) to actually automate user input.;;
Python.Correct me if Im wrong but this is only possible if the page doesnt do anything on the client side, lets say load something using JS, right?Also, lets say that im automating several forms one after the other but the config of each form depends on the previous, could I still do it without rendering the page?;;
> Correct me if Im wrong but this is only possible if the page doesnt do anything on the client side, lets say load something using JS, right?Incorrect. You might have to mimic whatever the javascript does, but in the end it will still do a POST. Unless it's a lot of javascript that goes all crazy with the form it won't be a problem.;;
Thanks!Do you know any good Python library for this?;;
No experience with Python, but this was the first result for *Python HTTP POST*: https://docs.python.org/2/library/httplib.htmlThere are some examples at the bottom of the page.;;
https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#module-urllib.requestExamples: https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#examplesurllib will be easier than the httplib the other guy posted. See: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3305250/python-urllib-vs-httplib;;
If it's a http get/post form, you can probably send the information directly to the website using your favourite programming language. If you don't know how to do that, you could look into [autohotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/), a computer program that can record mouse movement and clicks.;;
Actually for automating the accessing of web applications you're better of using [selenium webdriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/).;;
Thanks!;;
Easiest way is to use something like Fiddler to capture the request that is sent from you to the server, when you submit a form.Then submit it once manually, and look at the data that is being sent (this is where Fiddler comes into play).Then take the raw version (it's just a string of text) of the request sent, and make a program that fills in the data in the raw request, replacing the other data you entered manually.Then you make the program fill out the data a 100 times and send the request a 100 times.;;
Thanks!;;
"Look at [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html)A regular expression that would match rmis0 to rmis999 for example would be ""rmis([0-9]{1,3})"". If you use this regex capture the first group would contain just the number. Edit: example:    import re    input = 'proc print data = rmis100'    m = re.search('rmis([0-9]{1,3})', input)    if m != None:            print('Found number ' + m.group(1))    else:            print('No match found')";;
Thank you, this did the trick nicely.;;
"""Unresolved reference"" means that something you're using (eg, `sf::Color::Green`) does not exist (or could not be found). You've likely not included the libraries properly.Have you read this: http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.1/start-vc.php";;
Yeah I have read their guides (as well as many others) and I don't understand what I'm doing wrong :(;;
Try asking a specific question here or on StackOverflow.;;
Why is there no link to a github repo for a project?;;
I was thinking exactly the same thing.That said, I don't think it should be limited to *just* Github repositories.  On the other hand, it's probably wise to disallow people linking to any random URL on the internet.;;
Meh, I'd say just allow any random link. It's not really any different from if someone posted a malicious link here or on any other site. Otherwise you'd miss out on anything using a more exotic host or self hosting.Besides, they could just put the link in the description if there's no other specific place to put it.;;
At the least add bitbucket.;;
Side note, but the site looks pretty good IMO. Nice job.;;
Great site! One nice feature you might want to think about adding is some kind of PM to get in contact. No one uses email anymore :D(and hide the mail after adding that feature maybe/ give the option to hide it?);;
thanks for the suggestion! i'll think about it :);;
I noticed that the tags aren't really being used by the initial posters in a useful way. For example, searching for C++ tags brings up 2 results, then C++ is mentioned in the description of many other hacks.

Nice :)I did add my project up there. Hoping someone would be interested.;;

Actually, pre-standardisation books aren't necessarily compatible.  Pre-C++11 books will probably be compatible, though they're not guaranteed to be.The biggest issue, though, is that the style of C++ has changed significantly even over the past ten years, let alone over the almost twenty that the OP is talking about.  Idiomatically, the book is going to be completely outdated.K&R is still relevant for C, because the essentials of C haven't changed.;;
It looks like you aren't using a window manager and just painting yourself, right?  If that's the case then you need to listen for window resizing and repaint your canvas.;;
there is already a redraw everytime i resize the window.;;
You need to use Invalidate() instead of redraw.;;
(I think he even needs both, but definitely invalidate() to trigger recalculation of the involved Swing objects, e.g. to make them change size and location.);;
Let's look at what actually happens in the video.* The program starts, and is brought to the foreground. The grid is here rendered correctly.* You resize the window to a larger size, revealing a lot of black.* You resize the window to a size smaller than the original, hiding a lot of the hex grid.* You return the window to approximately the original size, at which point the previously obscured part of your hex grid has been replaced with black.Now, at this point, there are a few likely suspects that spring to mind. The first, and simplest, explanation is that the background-color for your JFrame is set to black, and your rendering code is not running for some reason. If this is the case, you should make sure that your component's rendering is called when a repainting of the component is requested.The second likely scenario is that your rendering does in fact run, but you've forgotten a detail or two. Let's make a mental note that the grid, like the appearing background, is black.If the JFrame has a black background color, and your component is transparent, redrawing the grid by itself will draw with black on black, and the end result will be as if it was never drawn. If your rendering is slightly more clever, only redrawing the necessary areas, but not from a buffer, you may be forgetting to redraw the white background, or forgetting to set the color to white before drawing it.If you were redrawing with background every time, and you forgot to set the color to whitebefore drawing the background, you would see the entire area turn black on first resize.Edit: It would be helpful if you had posted the source code responsible for rendering.;;
