"You should specify language, but in languages like Java, `0.0` is a `double` and `0.0f` is a `float`.

Both `double` and `float` are floating-point number formats.  In Java, floats are 4 bytes and doubles are 8 bytes.  They both conform to IEEE 754 standards.";;
Oh, I totally forgot. I'm referring to C/C++ mainly.;;
"0.5 and 0.5f are different values.  In the case where the number is exactly representable as both a float and a double, the difference doesn't really matter, but it can be really important for values that aren't exactly representable, which is most values.  It's about correctness, not efficiency.  If you write something like this:

    float f = 0.4;

You are not really assigning 0.4 to f, you're assigning 0.4f.  Those are two different values.  Run this program and explain the output:

    #include <stdio.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        float f = 0.4;
        
        if(f == 0.4) {
            puts(""equal"");
        } else {
            puts(""not equal"");
        }
        return 0;
    }
";;
Interesting, that makes sense, but are these the only kinds of situations where this is an issue, because, particularly as a graphics programmer, I've learned we should basically never check for direct equality like that with a float anyways. Instead we should check that the difference between 0.4 and f are within some kind of acceptable margin. In which case, it seems like the error you're referring to wouldn't matter anyway.;;
"As long as you understand that 0.4 and 0.4f are different values, and are okay with that silent implicit conversion, then I suppose it's fine.  It's just that C++ has too many of these hidden gotcha implicit conversions that you probably don't want to fuel that fire.
";;
By default a decimal like 0.3 is a double, so if you specify f, it makes the literal a float. ;;
Sorry, I wasn't clear. I know the difference between the two, but a double will be converted to a float when needed in c++, so I was asking whether this little conversion really mattered enough to avoid using the cleaner notation.;;
Well it depends, in GLSL a decimal literal is by default a float. In C++, if you create a vec4 that expects 4 floats, there will be an implicit conversion from your literal doubles to floats - so it's best to post-fix with f. ;;
This is what I was wondering about. Is it better to add the f *because* the implicit conversion should be avoided, or is it for a different reason?;;
Depends on the platform. For some, the conversion from float to double is free, but on other platforms there could be a minor performance implication. Either way, if you're working with openGL, there's no reason not to avoid the cast by just specifying float ;;

"The expression `new ArrayList<String>()` creates a new object of type `ArrayList<String>` and returns a reference to that object.

The declaration `List<String> myList;` declares `myList` to be a variable that can hold a reference to an object of type `List<String>` or any type that extends `List<String>`.

Since `ArrayList<String>` extends `List<String>`, a reference to an object of type `ArrayList<String>`, such as that returned by the expression `new ArrayList<String>()`, can be stored in a variable declared to be of type `List<String>`.";;
So only method of type List can be invoked from myList object right?;;
Correct.;;
"List is a less specific type than ArrayList.  Or rather, an ArrayList is one type of List.  Since all ArrayLists are Lists, it's fine to have a List reference that actually refers to an ArrayList object.  The reverse is not true — you can't have a reference to a specific type of something that refers to a less specific object.  All ArrayLists are Lists but not all Lists are ArrayLists.

";;
"In Java, you must declare the type of each variable when you define one. If the variable is a non-primitive type (not a byte, char, boolean, int, long, short, float, or double), then it actually holds a reference. If the declared type is an interface (like List<E>), then the variable must reference something that is an instance of a concrete class that implements that interface.  
If the declared type is a class (which can be abstract or non-abstract), then it must hold a reference to an instance of a concrete class that extends that class.  
Whenever you invoke a method on a reference, it actually figures out which method to call at runtime! List<E> is an interface, so it wouldn't make any sense to try to invoke its version of any method. Java will use runtime type information (RTTI) to figure out that it actually needs to use ArrayList<E>'s implementation of any method called on myList.  
Of course, this also implies that you can only invoke methods from List<E> on myList. So what happens if you want to invoke a method on your ArrayList<E> that it didn't inherit from List<E>? You'll need to do a cast. Of course, you'll want to use the instanceof operator before doing so, since otherwise you may get a ClassCastException at runtime.

The reasoning given isn't great. In both cases having a single variable allows you to easily change the value if needed. However, using const is a statement that the variable will never change while the program is running. This allows the compiler to enforce this and throw errors if you ever try to accidentally change it and may allow the compiler to perform optimizations it could not otherwise perform. Prefer to use const variables whenever possible so that you can gain these benefits.;;
I see, thanks!;;
The compiler will often optimize it as if it was a `#define`, so it doesn't take up any space or do any calculations at runtime.;;

"> So string is basically the same as what i tried to do with set statement, but it's able to influence variables?

Sorry, what? `string` is a type, just like `float` or `int`. It is a type that can hold a string of text. So `string yesno;` declares a variable named `yesno` of type `string`.

>also, if i make the string larger

You forgot to type the end of that question.

>string 123;

You can't use numbers as names of variables.

>cout<<""1,2 or 3?"" if(1))X=5 if(2) X=10

Both `1` and `2` are true expressions, so both those `if` statements will always execute their body. I guess you want to read in some input and compare it to the numbers 1 and 2? You have to explicitly do it. Programming is like that; you have to actually tell the computer in detail what you're thinking. ""What you type is what you get"".

By the way, you have an extra closing parenthesis and no semicolons in your example there. I know it's just an example, but it demonstrates a sort of sloppiness which you just can't allow yourself if you want to write computer programs. You have to write everything exactly right.

But that's not a question? What about if you make the string larger?

And what exactly do you mean by making the string larger? In your example, you don't set the string to anything at all, you just declare the variable but never use it. In any case, the string can be any length and it doesn't really affect anything. Note however that `>>` into a string by default reads only up to the next whitespace, so if the user types more than one word only the first word will be put in the string variable and the rest will remain in the input.

sorry for the terrible formatting, but for now it helps me understand the basics.
You already pointed out i can't do a string function with numbers? also, is the way i add more options appropriate? which function should i use instead of string?";;
"I think you're confusing the value held by the variable with the name of the variable. When you do

    string something;

that creates a variable *named* `something` which is of type `string`. The name of the variable doesn't affect the values it can hold in any way; those are two completely separate concepts. It's just the same as if we changed the word ""age"" so it was called ""aaaaaaaaage"", that wouldn't mean that people could now get older. It's just a name.

As for the alternatives the user can enter, that's something that you have to check yourself in the code and handle. So if you want to only accept ""yes"" and ""no"" as answers, you'll have to read in the answer, and then compare it to ""yes"" and ""no"", and if it isn't equal to either of them, then you have to do whatever it is you want to do in such a case; probably you want to print a message to the user telling him to answer ""yes"" or ""no"" and then go back and read the input again.

This is what I meant with ""What you type is what you get"" - because there is such an infinite number of different possible things you might conceivably want a program to do, programming languages make you type very verbosely, in great detail, what exactly it is you want done. It isn't really practical for the programming language itself to have tons of special-case functionality, which would also make it potentially very awkward or difficult to do anything the creator of the programming language didn't anticipate. So they provide basic operations, and you combine them together explicitly.

>You already pointed out i can't do a string function with numbers?

What I said was that you can't name a variable as a number. This should be clear when you consider how variables are used in the code; consider the following:

    number = something + 1;

If variables could be called names like ""1"", it wouldn't be possible for the computer to know if you were trying to add the number 1 to `something`, or if you meant to add the value of a variable named `1`. So variable names that are numbers simply aren't allowed. In C++, the rule is that the first character of the name can't be a digit, but you can have digits in the rest of the name. So ""a1"" is allowed, but ""1a"" isn't.

>which function should i use instead of string?

`string` is the right type if you want to read in text strings like ""yes"" and ""no"".

But notice one detail here: the word ""function"" carries another meaning in programming. Namely, a function is a named unit of executable code, taking some parameters and returning a result. You have one function in your program: namely, `main()`. So avoid using ""function"" for other things. `string` is a *type*. So are `int` and `float`, they're *types*, so called because they represent different *types* of information: strings of text, integer numbers, and ""floating point"" numbers (numbers that aren't necessarily integers), respectively. So when you say `string foo;` you are declaring that you want a variable named `foo`, which shall be able to hold values of type `string`.

Now these things should have been among the very first things explained by any sensible teaching material, so I think I might agree with /u/jesyspa when he said the videos you're watching might not be any good.
";;
"okay, so let me try to explain variables in C++. So a string represents a series of characters, like ""wohhhh"" or ""yes"" and ""no"". The floats you've been using so far represent numbers, more specifically numbers with decimal points. All types of variables represent a different thing. The code that your trying to do here is trying to make a string a number, but a string isn't a number.";;
"hm. Try:

    string yes_or_no;

Why do you think you need an AST? You can handle function calls perfectly well using RPN. Yacc doesn't give you an AST, though you could use to construct one, and the Python AST stuff is AFAIK intended for use when parsing Python code.;;
Ah yes I'm aware RPN is sufficient but I've read its not quite as... robust? I'm open to rpn solutions but couldn't get my shunting yard function to give rpn. Maybe it's just a matter of more tinkering, but I thought I'd make this post to be sure I'm not missing something simple. Also I understand that shunting yard can be built to give an ast anyway so I feel like at that point I might as well go for the whole shebang.;;
"The shunting yard algorithm can be used to build an AST. You need an additional stack of tree nodes (this is different from the operator stack), which is intially empty. When you would output an operand, you instead create a leaf node from it and push that onto the stack. Whenever you would output an operator, you create a node from it, then pop the two top operands from the output stack (or one if it's an unary operator), and add them as child nodes. Then you push the resulting tree to the output stack.

If the expression is well formed, you should be left with one node on the output stack at the end, which is the final AST.

There's an implementation in Java [here](https://www.klittlepage.com/2013/12/22/twelve-days-2013-shunting-yard-algorithm/). I've not seen an implementation in Python yet, but if you already have the shunting yard algorithm implemented, then it's a fairly straightforward modification.";;

"Like other posters have suggested, unit testing is a good idea - in lieu of a static type system it's probably the best tool you have for validating program correctness. 

Also, I would recommend using as many self-imposed strictures as possible. For example, avoid switching the types of variables or allowing functions to return different types. Throw exceptions instead of returning ""error"" values. If available, use Javascript's ""freeze"" and ""seal"" features. Use the static analysis tools available, like ""use strict"" or Facebook's Flow. 

Some languages also allow you to use ""assert"" statements for runtime checking. However, you can't - and shouldn't - assert everything  so what to check and when is a difficult judgment call sometimes. ";;

"I would like to add that getters/setters allows you to hide complexity or redundancy.

For example let's say you have a class that exposes an angle. You could have a getter for both degrees and radians without having to store both, doing the conversion in the getter itself.

This also reduces the chance for errors. Let's say you stored the angle in both degrees and radians. You would need to keep track of all the places the angle can change and ensure that both are updated accordingly.

Edit: Typos.";;
"> It lets you change the implementation later without changing your public interface (this is especially important for libraries).

This one.    
99% of programs out there are made to be used as code by other programmers. They need to change your variables (invariably) you give them getters and setters and this allows you to upgrade your whole code without worrying about the upgrade requiring them to rewrite their usage of your code. ";;
"Getters and setters aren't really special in this respect.  When you design a class, you come up with its public interface, typically in terms of member functions (and properties, if you're doing C#).  After that you think about what implementation would work well for this interface.  Getters and setters are just part of the interface design; it's not that you already have a member variable and then add getters and setters around it, it's that you have a getter and a setter and you choose to back them with a variable.

(Of course, that's how you design in theory.  In practice, you might be doing the design the other way around.  Then you add the getters and setters so that nobody knows.)";;
This is what I agree with. Getters and setters should be for interfacing. Unfortunately I think java beans taught many programmers to always write them for every field.;;
Yeah, I believe Spring requires that you define getters and setters if you want to use the class in a bean.  ;;
It doesn't for javaconfig. You can use constructor injection. ;;
"Be careful. There's a huge amount of misinformation in this thread.

>  why DO we go through all of the hassle and boilerplate of wrapping private variables with public getters and setters

For auto-properties, there really *is* no boilerplate. You just add `{ get; set; }`. That's it. Now it's a property, backed by a private variable you didn't even have to write, yet you're free to completely alter that internal representation without breaking the interface other classes rely on, which is the entire point.

The field is an abstract *property* of the object. How it gets the value is an *implementation* detail that should be encapsulated. With a property it is.

If you expose a raw member variable, you can't change it to a property later without breaking binary compatibility with other code using your assembly,  breaking serialized versions of your class instance, breaking certain types of code that reflects over your class/instances, and in general breaking any code that depended on it being a raw variable, such as coding using at an `out` parameter. There are actually cases where this will change behavior silently without so much as a compiler warning. It also means your code is harder to debug because you can't break on reads/writes to the property, that member can't participate in data binding, so on and so forth.

Properties are a fantastic feature of C#, which lets you write code that consumes getters/setters in a clean and natural way. They have tons of advantages and no disadvantages (the exceptions here are ultra technical edge cases). Avoiding them so you don't have to type 10 characters of ""boilerplate"" is bad idea.";;
"This is the only accurate response in this thread.

That's the meat of it. I also would like to add that consumers writing descendent classes can't override a member field but they can a property.";;

Scala has taken a similar approach. It's even easier to make basic properties, but somewhat more annoying if you decide you want the setters or getters to actually do anything. ;;
"I think you're missing a small piece of the puzzle:

"Others have already answered your question, but lombok is a great library for reducing Java boilerplate.

I love writing less code.";;
I think the main reason for getters and setters is that instead of modifying the variable directly, you use a method that is easier to follow in the stacktrace once things go wrong. But I do agree that it sort of feels silly and more like a makeshift workaround. ;;
"*In theory*, it allows you to separate your public interface from implementation detail, but I honestly don't find that argument that compelling in classes with a lot of setters. Imagine having a setter called `setFoo` and then suddenly you have to change the detail of your class so that it doesn't have the member `foo` anymore, or `foo` is of a different type. Suddenly you have a setter that is contrary to virtually all the other setters out there. You can always create a new setter and start deprecating the old one, but I think the bottom line is that as long as you have setters, your class's inner details are already exposed. To some extent, this is true to with getter as well.

Having a setter allows an extra layer of indirection where you can *perhaps* bridge the implementation detail of the old one and the new one, but I'm personally doubtful of how well it works in practice. Do these setters ever get changed in your experience?

I think the point is not to just blindly create some private members and putting getters and setters for all of them. Rather, I think the point has always been, first, to hide the implementation detail of your class by making your class members private, and second, to prevent them from being exposed as much as possible by preferably introducing no setter at all, and only introduce the getters that make sense in the context of your class. See how `ArrayList` has essentially no setter and getter because it only needs to implement the methods corresponding to the interface `List` to logically make sense and be useful.

EDIT:

To prevent ambiguity, I should note here that by ""setter"" and ""getter"", I'm referring to the methods that have a one-to-one correspondence with the members of some class, as it seems to be common practice to just make member fields private and then blindly boilerplate setters and getters for all of them.";;
"In C# the whole purpose of properties is to make it feel like you're manipulating or reading a public member.  Is:

    public int Foo { get; set; }

Really that much more effort than this?

    public int Foo;

Without having to repeat others too much, consider a purely computed field:

    public int Total
    {
        get
        {
            return Accounts.Sum(account => account.Balance);
        }
    }

Or what if you want to flag that a variable has been changed?

    private bool _nameChanged;
    private string _name;
    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set
        {
            _nameChanged = true;
            _name = value;
        }
    }

It's a lot more consistent to use a single strategy to interface with member variables.  I think the relatively minor investment of typing out ""get"" and ""set"" after your variable declaration is worth not having to worry about making sure everybody who uses those variables behaves in synchronization sometime later down the line.

I know this is not as easy and is far more time consuming in Java, but many of the IDEs you stated make transitioning to a property / gettersetter method easier will also automatically generate getter / setter methods for you so I still don't see how this is really that big of a deal when the only thing you will accomplish by not doing it is to save yourself a couple of keystrokes.";;
"in c# there tends to be a strong distinction between variables with public getters or setters, which we call properties, and private variables which we call fields.

if it's publicly accessible, the value is a property of the object; it tells us something about the object. if it's not publicly accessible, then it's just a value we're holding for work behind the scenes.

theoretically, you know when you reference class.Property that it's just a value and you're not doing anything that will change the state of the object. whereas when you call class.Function() you can assume that you're actually doing work.

the get/set system in c# allows you to do things more quickly in some cases:

    public string Name { get; private set; }

vs.

    private string name;

    public string GetName() { return this.name; }

it also allows, in my opinion, for better organization of your code. everything related to just getting or setting a value can be defined in one place rather than having variables and functions that can be put wherever.

in the end though, it's just a tool in the language like anything else.

i just wish microsoft would add some better built-in support for mvvm. i'm pretty sick and tired of having hundreds of these types of things in my code:

    private string name;

    public string Name
    {
      get
      {
        return this.name;
      }

      set
      {
        if (this.name == value)
        {
          return;
        }

        this.name = value;
        this.RaisePropertyChange();
      }
    }";;
"It's just part of Good Practice^TM and you're right, sometimes it does seem like a lot of boilerplate for little gain.  In fact, in one of my personal Java projects I have core data objects that are nothing more than collections of public fields for exactly the reasons you've described.  But--these objects are just dumb data containers and aren't meant to provide any abstraction whatsoever.

Most of the time, our class is an abstraction for something.  It may not be a very strong or interesting abstraction, but conceptually we like to say that a `Person` is a type with a name, age, etc., not just a wrapper on a `String`, `int`, etc.  Sure, we're almost certainly implementing the name as a `String`, but by going through methods instead of accessing the guts directly, we're presenting this `Person` type slightly more abstractly.

When someone needs to know your name, they have to ask you for it.  They can't just rip it out of your soul.";;
If a good practice doesn't give benefits it's not a good practice.;;
"In this case, however, there are benefits.

For example, if you use a private field for distance_in_km you can have two getters, one that returns the value directly and another that first converts to miles and then returns the value.

This means that you won't have to do any conversions later and it means that you don't need to maintain two very similar fields wherever one of them is altered.
";;
"My very limited experience with the {get; set; } has been that I dislike it. I got a feeling it is because I have misunderstood their usage.

I feel I exposed a local variable with the only gain being slightly ""easier"" access in terms of typing for it, but at the loss of removing validation on the ""set"" part, as well as suddenly data is now accessed sometimes via methodes () ending and sometimes just direct on the ""value"".

I tried doing a little search back when I first found this option, and I have yet to find something compelling of what the advantage is (beside slightly less typing). If someone got a link for why this is the God's gift to programmers, do share it.";;
"You can add validation in C#'s setter methods like in this example.

    private string firstName;

    public String FirstName
    {
        get
        {
            return firstName;
        }
        set
        {
            // validate the input
            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(value))
            {
                // throw exception, or do whatever
            }
            firstName = value;
        }
    }
Writing just ``public string FirstName { get; set; }`` is just a short way of writing this:

    private string firstName;
    public String FirstName
    {
        get
        {
            return firstName;
        }
        set

As far as whether or not this is better than using methods for setting and getting values, well, it's just less typing, doing it the java way will yield the same results.

It's also a nice way of grouping the getter and the setter for one value together in one code block, as opposed to doing it in separate methods.";;
"Another positive I didn't see mentioned (I only skimmed) is that you can have multiple getters or setters based on your needs.

Example: Say you have a Vector type object (mathematical). You could have getters for different things, one of which you pick as the ""default getter"":

* getNormalized : returns a normalized version of the vector
* getAsInt: returns the vector rounded to the closest int (for say grid-based implementation)
* getOpposite : returns the vector that points in the opposite direction

While typically these are thought of as methods.. they're still getters since you don't want to change the original data.. so depending on your data types and code structure, it may be best to have these in mind.

Another example: You may want to store your data as floats, but only ever return the values as ints, so your getter would be converting or casting every time.";;
Mocking!;;
To add my 2 cents , getters and setters may not be wanted. Most of the time , I will program my constructors to default the value of the class members and not allow any data to interface..;;
"What I've learned from experience is that it's good for contract programming (interfaces) where attributes aren't part of the spec, but only methods are. Also, it lets you perform tasks on data upon setting and getting (I've always preferred mutating and accessing...mutators and accessors...vs getters and setters). For example, I might have an attribute where the data is always stored encrypted. I can wrap that functionality in the setter, and then seamlessly decrypt it with the getter.

You might say ""well, just use them for those methods"" well, then you have an inconsistencies.";;
I'm learning Python after Java, and one of Python's neat features is the ability to define class methods that basically intercept any attempt to get, set, or delete any instance variable in that class. It's saved my bacon more than a few times.;;
"In object oriented programming it's for encapsulation. You use setters as public methods to set private attributes in the object after it has been instantiated. The object then uses it's own validation to ensure the value each setter receives is valid.

Getters are public methods to get the value of variables from the object.";;

)'z;;
"I think the key is just to make getters and setters easier to create and manage. Objective-C does this with `@property`, which makes getters and setters for you, based on a standard naming system. If you want to override the defaults, you can make them by hand.

It may seem like a prissy model that only exists in order to conform to strict OO design, but I think the nature of objects as mutating themselves is something you want to try to preserve up and down the line, if not for any other reason than basic consistency.

Sure, you might argue that it's not very important in some situations. But then again, we'd absolutely insist on separation of concerns in plenty of other cases, wouldn't we? The bottom line is that we don't want objects changing each other. We want objects asking other objects to change themselves. We should be able to assume that this is the model, through-and-through. And creating getters/setters is part of that.

TL;DR: Don't get rid of getters and setters, just make them easier to implement with sugary language features like Objective-C's `@property`.";;
"For most cases, it's pointless, but if something changes, you can easily change the getter/setter without changing the API.  You can dynamically do things when a value is get or set.

* For setters, it let's you do sanity checks that the user is using it correctly.  Say you have an interest application and by law you can't charge more than 8% interest.  You can check this in the set method and ""do something"" if users enters bad value (throw exception, log error, default to highest legal value, etc).  Not possible with global variables.

* For getters, instead of storing a value, you can do a calculation on the fly.  This is nice because you ensure that you always have the most up to date value and don't have to worry about everything that can change it's state.  Just re-calcualte when user requests value.  For example, you want to calculate your reminding mortgage payoff amount.  This has a lot of variables (payments, interest, start date of loan, term, etc).  If any of these values change you don't carry though, since you just re-calculate using the current values (which should be up to date)

* It makes serialization a lot ""simpler"" in some APIs.  I have a JSON library that can convert java object to Json and visa-versa, but requires that all variables have properly named getter/setters.  Maybe this is a hack, but makes my life a lot easier.

* In theory, most IDE shoudl auto create getters/setters for you and compilers should inline simple getters/setters.  So in theory, it's almost 0 cost in terms of development and performance time.

* You can provide multiple getters/setters depending on your needs.  For example, you could have an application that logs temperature but provides getters/setters for celsius, fahrenheit, and kelvin.  Internally you can store it however you want and user can use methods for whatever they are working with and everything ""just works""

"Uhm... So a lot of people use getters, setters or property methods for no reason I guess?

Data structures and algorithms is all code is, guys :)

I don't perform vast optimizations on my code, and I'm not sure there's a point in trying in C# or Java considering memory control is a massive factor in hardcore optimizing...

But I at least make sure to know what I'm missing out on.

In the case of making one library communicate with another, you often end up with a binary format.  Fields tend to have a direct reference to assign a value to, whereas methods are a subroutine that gets invoked with a state context.

That forms an interface, often even a binary interface.

So if you modify the field description in any way (size, name, method or field), you end up modifying the interface.  Methods are ""more"" mutable because a method is just an endpoint that describes the I and O parts of IPO (input, processing, output).

The implementation is kept ""secret"" and handles processing.  So they provide that level of flexibility.

You can ultimately make a method accept ""anything"" and output ""anything"", with some computational restrictions depending on your language or environment, so ultimately they've a very flexible solution.

But once again, they're also part of your interface.  That interface is one way to define externally available operations of a utility...  It can break.  It probably will, no matter what the crazy Java philosophy is.";;

"Do you feel the same about global variables?

If a class is a mini program (it is) then a public field is a global. Anyone can change it at any time and break the assumptions you've built into your methods.

Even if *you* put lots of checks to ensure that x != 0, others might not be so diligent. Now your class is throwing DivideByZeroExceptions everywhere and it's going to cost you a day in the debugger to track it down.";;
"A class isn't a mini program, it's a blueprint for an object.  A global variable is independent of any other object.

Private variables with getter and setter that do nothing are just the same as public variables. Although an advantage of the getter and setter (in other languages anyway, not sure about Java) is that you can later change your setter without breaking code that's already compiled against the same interface.
";;
The thing is: this doesn't apply to >90% of the getters and setters you'll come across. There is a fuckton of public getSomeShit(){return SomeShit;} in a lot of corporate Java code, just because people heard they should do it that way, even though they don't have a clue why the fuck they're doing it. Case in point: OP.;
"Because Java doesn't have C# style properties, inserting a check (like the x = 0 one above) would require refactoring that an automatic tool couldn't do.

If your interface to change x was a method to begin with, inserting the check is one local change. No need to find every time x was assigned and replace it with a method.

It's ugly boilerplate, yes, but it serves a purpose. This is why C# uses properties instead - the syntax is 100 times cleaner.";;

"A quick note about the if statement in your `taskFunc` method.

Suppose we're describing instructions on how you're going to get dressed for the day depending on the weather. We might have an if-statement that looks like

    if(very cold outside){
        put on underwear
        put on thick pants and heavy jacket
    } 
    else if(very hot outside){
        put on underwear
        put on shorts and a t-shirt
    }
    else{
        put on underwear
        put on whatever else you feel like
    }

Notice how we've stated you should put on underwear regardless of the weather (which may differ from your life choices, but we won't go into that :P). Since we want that to happen regardless of the weather condition, that should be extracted from the if statement to avoid repeating ourself.

    put on underwear

    if(very cold outside){
        put on thick pants and heavy jacket
    }
    else if(very hot outside){
        put on shorts and a t-shirt
    }
    else{
        put on whatever else you feel like
    }

This is an important not only because it's clear that putting on the underwear will happen no matter what, there's no chance of us forgetting to put on underwear if we happen to add an additional else-if clause.

"It's not safe, because the compiler is going to have emit code that reads the 64-bit number, does bitwise operations on it to access the individual bytes, and then writes the result back - the reads and writes by the various threads can occur in any order.

Of course, if you actually want to access 64 bits of memory in a  bytewise manner, the obvious data structure to use is an array of char, in which case the access to each byte would be thread-safe.";;
"No, you can't do that.  Any time you have multiple threads operating on the same object, you need some kind of lock or mutex to ensure that only one of them is ever accessing it at once.

If instead of a single 8 byte `long long`, you had an array of 8 chars, then it would be safe for threads to access individual chars without locks, as long as no two threads attempt to access the same chars.  That's because in that case there are 8 different objects, not one object.  The code that compiler generates is different in the two cases.  If you tell the compiler that there's a single `long long` object, it's going to generate code that accesses it as a whole; there's no valid way to tell it just to access a portion of that object.

Edit: and by ""no valid way"", I mean even if you try to write bitmasking code that logically appears to only read or write a part of the `long long`, the compiler is still within its rights to transform that into something that reads and writes the entire object in a thread-unsafe manner (e.g. without barriers or synchronization.)";;
"Maybe, maybe not.  This depends on the language you're working in, and if that doesn't guarantee what happens (in which case you shouldn't do it!), on the implementation and the architecture.

There's a few things to note here.

What do you mean by ""use and/or modify""?  Are you assuming that they perform a single atomic operation?  Your phrasing suggests that there are four operations that may be reordered (giving 4! possible orders), but your question suggests that thread A may read bytes 1-2 before thread B reads bytes 3-4, and then write them after thread B writes.

Secondly, what do you mean by ""use and/or modify **bytes 1-2**""?  Are you saying that you will make a pointer to those bytes and perform all reads and writes through that pointer?  Or are you just saying you'll be using bitops that only affect the lower two bytes (then why isn't `foo` unsigned)?

Thirdly, what do you mean by ""first copy it, then do something, and finally copy it back""?  On an x86 processor, actual work is going to happen in registers.  That's not a matter of threading, it's it's just how the computation model generally works.  Are you asking about copying that may happen above that?  Thread-specific caches?";;
No, this is unsafe. The compiler will generate code to work with the 64 bit value.  You need interlocked operations if they exist for the modifications you need. Or you need a full lock.  Or you need to restructure your data.;;
It is possible but it will not be built into any language. You will need to write some kind of thread safe manager to ensure safe access and sync of the final resulting byte array. ;;
"> Can multiple threads operate on a single 64 bit int at the same time if they each use different bytes? 

Yes, of course you can. The computer doesn't care if you treat that as 1 64-bit value or 8 8-bit values, or some other subdivision, but that can possibly be constrained by memory alignment issues and you need to be aware of the endianness of the compute, that you're maintaining meaningful bit patterns for `foo`'s type (2's complement signed integer? IEEE 754 float?), the fact that it might not be performant because the CPU is operating on word-sized chunks anyway, so on and so forth.

You can do this by having each thread a pointer to a 2 byte type at the appropriate location in `foo`. It's also routinely done in languages like C using a `union`. This is very common in the Win32 API. For instance, here's one for doing [exactly what you're talking about](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383713%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) (e.g. addressing parts of a multi-byte integer independently).";;
"So...have you tried it?

> My confusion comes from not understanding whether the threads operate directly on the data or if they first copy it, then do something, and finally copy it back.

They do whatever you tell them to do. Did you write a temp variable? Then it uses one. The code you write in a threaded function works the same way it does anywhere else. So the question becomes, when you write *any* code that modifies data, does the machine modify the data ""directly"" or not. (Do you know the answer(s) to that?)

You cannot assume that the compiler will use any temporary storage.  As long as the program behaves as if there was a temp,  it doesn't matter if there was one.

"I write software for a company with a massive customer base and I still post 'basic' questions here. Programming is a continuous learning cycle, only liars or inflated egos will say they have nothing left to learn.

Async issues are one of the worse things there are. Often impossible to replicate easily as even at a low level, you as a programmer, have very little to no control over the order threaded applications run in. That's all up to the OS' scheduler.

Even unit tests fail at testing threaded operations. The best you can do is fake situations where threaded issues might occur, but guess what, all that test will tell you is: program defensively when using threads. The best thing to do is be as safe as possible when it comes to threads. Everything accessed across threads need some kind of lock, mutex, queue, etc.

As for the temp var thing... That's not what they meant. They mean how does the CPU operate on a 64 bit value when you only access some of the bits. Which, in terms of machine code, -does- take a copy (of the entire 64 bits), edit the specified ones, then set the entire 64 bits back, which makes it unsafe, two threads reading and writing the entire 64 bits, regardless of what bits they are, will cause issues. Thread A reads 0b0000, Thread B reads 0b0000, Thread A writes 0b0011, Thread B writes 0b1100, expected value to developer is 0b1111, actual value will be 0b1100 as Thread B was not aware of Thread A's write at the time it read.";;
">I write software for a company with a massive customer base and I still post 'basic' questions here. Programming is a continuous learning cycle, only liars or inflated egos will say they have nothing left to learn.

Of course. That's why I read the OP and made the judgement call - I could be wrong - that they are a beginner in the topic.

>... Even unit tests fail at testing threaded operations...

Yes, it was a mistake of me to use the word ""test"", which in the year 2015 means something different than what I'm used to, if it means anything at all. It was an oversight on my part and I can understand why some of the argument seems to be at cross purposes. So I will try to be more clear. My initial statement was ""did you try it"" - there is a reason most non-Java schools begin with a REPL language, after all. Hands on work improves understanding. Obviously C/C++ does not have a REPL (without getting crazy, anyway), but the sentiment was supposed to be: throw shit around and see what happens, not *write a unit test you probably won't understand for code you definitely don't understand and assume everything is good*. Even still, I'm having trouble understanding how people are reading my post and assuming I meant the insane interpretation.

>As for the temp var thing... That's not what they meant. They mean how does the CPU operate on a 64 bit value when you only access some of the bits.

The OP stated ""My confusion comes from not understanding whether *the threads* operate directly on the data or if they first copy it, then do something, and finally copy it back."" To me it sounded as if OP thought threads *might* operate on a higher logical layer than ""regular"" code. (ie before we even get down to the CPU.) It's all just ""regular"" code (for C/C++), which is what I tried to convey, assuming OP had a grasp on what happens to ""regular"" code. I suppose that was a mistake too.

If I can suggest getting even more granular:

1. HTML - Get your content on the page
2. CSS - Get your content to where it looks good (or at least reasonably good) on devices of varying widths. This includes phones.
3. Javascript (DOM manipulation -- adding and removing elements from a page, showing/hiding elements, etc.)

Possible yes. Feasible? No. Building an app is probably going to cost you more than a few thousand dollars and even then most apps barely break even.

"Based on knowing Python and Java so far, it may be worthwhile to pick up an object-oriented programming language like C++ or C#. This is going to teach you how to break up your application into smaller, reusable chunks as well as dive into some higher abstract concepts like lambdas and dependency injection.

If you're a CS major, or even if you just like doing statistical analysis you might try the R programming language - this is another language that's going to mess with your head a bit to learn at first.

While, like Barrucadu stated, SQL isn't a programming language - you might pick up a database like Postgres or SQL Server and learn PL/SQL or T-SQL - these are extensions to the SQL standard that allow you to write conditional statements, declare variables, write functions, etc. Database development is some of the most rewarding learning, I think, a young developer can do. It has some really good gratification qualities to it, and there's nothing like building your first database, attaching an application to it, and being able to witness data being manipulated and transferred into information delivered by your application.";;
"Haskell, Erlang, Lisp, Clojure, Scala, F#, ... and the likes encompass functional programming. In FP, you have to work with values being immutable, with functions as the sole means of code organization, without Smalltalk/Java-like classes or objects, with seperation of I/O from ""normal"" execution and so forth. Haskell is the purest / most strict implementation of the lambda calculus, the underlying principle of functional programming.

Prolog is the prime example for logical programming. The underlying principle is predicate/first-order logic. If you actually want to learn it, I'd suggest to combine it with automata theory and language processing.

Rust is a newer language that doesn't resemble a special paradigm, but introduces ownership, a concept worth mentioning since I don't know of any other language that has this.";;
SQL *is* Turing complete, but it's not really a programming language in the sense that the others you named are. It's certainly useful to know if you ever want to work with databases, but it's probably not as eye-opening as learning Haskell or Scheme would be.;;

        #define kernel(a)    ((0x0000<=(a) && (a)<0x1000))

Actually it's the same, but the first is more readable. Furthermore, the ""is"" prefix suggests that you can obtain either true (1) or false (0).
You could even directly write:

    #define isKernel(a)    (a<0x1000)?1:0

"The domain name is not changing — that would be impossible.  The path portion of the URL is.  That can be changed dynamically in JavaScript using the [HTML5 history APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history).  This is the basis of how so-called single page apps work.  When you click on something in such an app, it's as if you browsed to a new URL, but instead of that actually happening, JavaScript just changes the page content and the URL without actually reloading anything.  Highly dynamic sites use this technique because they tend to load a buttload of JS and this prevents having to reload all of it on every page.  The site becomes a continuously running JavaScript program that can maintain state between pages, rather than the traditional model where everything is torn down and reset when you load a new page and any scripting has to start over from nothing.
";;
The domain name is a 'name' alias for an IP adress. It won't change. What is changing is the window.location or URL. And that's something you can easily do in JavaScript. When you scroll there's a script that recieves the scroll requests. It simply checks which article is visible at that moment and changes the URL. ;;

Are you talking about Java interfaces?;;
Sorry no, I working with C# in .NET;;
"I'm gonna try and explain C#'s interfaces as best I can.

Interfaces only contain the *signatures* of methods and properties, not their actual implementations (= bodies)

    public interface IMyInterface // you don't have to but you'll want to prefix your interface names with 'I'
    {
        bool SomeBoolean { get; set; }
        // this is a property with bodiless getter and setter

        string GetString();
        void DoThing(int argument);
       // only the signature, no body
    }

Note that the signatures cannot have access modifiers, but can have access specifiers, such as `protected` or `internal`.

When creating a class, you can derive from as many interfaces as you want. The only condition is that you must give implementations to the interface's methods and properties. I like treating interface inheriting as saying ""I promise to provide some kind of implementation for these methods and properties.""

    public class MyClass : IMyInterface
    {
        public bool SomeBoolean
        {
            get { return _someBoolean; }
            set { _someBoolean = value; }
        }
        bool _someBoolean = true;

        public string GetString()
        {
            return ""Hello World!"";
        }

        public void DoThing()
        {
            Console.WriteLine(""Doing thing"");
        }
    }

As the interface doesn't define any access modifiers, your implementations must always be `public` (with any access specifiers defined in the interface added).

Somewhere else in your code, you can use interfaces as types for your objects.

    IMyInterface _myObject = new MyClass();

Now that you have an object of type `IMyInterface`, you can use the properties and methods the interface has and be sure they'll have some sort of implementation.

    Console.WriteLine(_myObject.GetString());
    Console.WriteLine(_myObject.SomeBoolean);
    _myObject.DoThing();
    
    >Hello World!
    >True
    >Doing thing

This is just the basic use of interfaces, I'm not gonna go into the depths of them now. You can read more about them [over here.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms173156.aspx)";;
"That gives me a little bit more of an understanding, lets take below for example I can do this question easily enough, but I don't understand where would an interface come in this example. I presume you implement it in the base class Patient, then all classes will inherit the interface.. but why do I need it for this question?

**Question 2 - 35 Marks**
A local hospital called “XYZ Hospital” has requested a software company to develop an information system for the hospital. As a part of the software team, you are required to write the following classes, interfaces etc. in C#.

**a) An Address class the with following specification:**

 House number (property)

 Street (property)

 City (property)

 A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).
(5 marks)

**b) A Patient class with the following specifications:**
 PatientId (property)

 PatientName (property)

 PatientAddress (property) – use already created Address class.

 PatientType (property) – can be public or private

 A constructor that uses all the properties

 A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).
(5 marks)

**c) An OutPatient class extends the Patient class with following properties**
 VisitDate

 VisitNo

 A constructor with all properties

 A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).
(7 marks)

**d) A ResidentPatient class that extends the Patient class**
 AdmissionDate

 DischargeDate

 RoomNo

 A constructor with all properties

 A ToString() method which returns the details held in this class. (i.e. the properties of the class).

**Write a test class to create two objects, one of type OutPatient and one of type ResidentPatient and display their details.**
(7 marks)";;
Even though the question says to write the following classes, interfaces etc, nowhere there it actually requires you to use interfaces. `Address`, `Patient`, `OutPatient` and `ResidentPatient` must be classes, because they all require you to override `ToString()`, which interfaces cannot do.;;
"Thats the way I was doing it, over riding the ToString method for each class and I was racking my brain trying to figure out how an interface fits into this scenario. 

Do you know why they would have put that into the exam paper then?";;
Maybe they give the same task for all questions, even though not all of them require interfaces. Or maybe they're trying to confuse you.;;
"* a) An Address class

* b) A Patient class
 
* etc

The exam specifically requires you only make classes. The first line must be the same in other exams.";;
There is no more mention of Interfaces in that exam, or previous exam papers, I think what /u/Backplague said was right, just trying to confuse you and throw you off the scent. ;;
"You're reading too much into the wording. These use-cases don't really have much use for interfaces. 

You'd typically want to have an interface somewhere where you're providing an API and expect 'someone else' to create an actual implementation. 

In this case your library might provide a ""PatientDatabase"" interface with a ""getPatientByName();"" method. You'd expect someone else to provide an actual implementation because that's beyond the scope of the project.

Another benefit of using interfaces over concrete classes in this scenario is testing: if you want to unit test ""patient"" functionality without having to connect to an actual database you could provide a mock implementation of the ""PatientDatabase""  interface just for testing.";;
I thought I put together a pretty good use case in [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3blo7x/z/csncaxu);;
"Love it, great example for me and well put. 

if possible could you give me a real world example in plain English? Like an Application, website, internal system.. etc. Where they would implement an Interface into their project? ";;
"Check out the core C# interfaces:

* IEnumerable - arrays, lists, queues. your implementation only cares what the next thing is, not how it's stored.
* IDisposable - resources that have manageable lifetimes. Your implementation doesn't care if it's a file, database or a TCP stream - just make sure it's closed when you're done.

Interfaces are just contracts between objects. It's a super abstracted form of polymorphism - interact with an object by what it *does*, not what it *is*.";;
"Yes, yes and not really. The last part ""network security"" is much too vague; it's a typical IT job, not something programmers are involved in, unless you're writing embedded router software which you would probably do in C.";;
So how for example banks are able to keep their money and not get hacked? ;;
"The most important part is to have the 'sensitive' systems simply not be connected to the internet in any way. But there's many layers of defense there, network security is just one part of it, and it's one part that's not really a ""developer"" job.";;
"For beginners switching between similar languages (and that's what C#, Python, Java and JavaScript are) is a waste of time because it's exactly that; a timesink. Such context switches slow you down a lot and don't really teach you anything. A for loop is just a for loop in any language, switching beween Java and Python isn't going to change that, it's just the syntax that's slightly different.

Only when you get at a level where you are confident that you can build almost anything in <language you picked> you should consider trying languages with a different paradigm (functional languages like Haskell, Logical language like Prolog) because these 'shifts' actually do make you a better and more well rounded developer. For example my experience with functional programming makes using lambda's in for example Java feel very natural. ";;
"One project I worked on a couple years ago used about 7 different languages in its code.  Different languages have strengths and weaknesses and are used for different things.  But *all* of them revolve around similar concepts.  Once you know one or two pretty well, learning another isn't actually all that hard.

That said, if you do want to branch out I recommend picking a language from a different category altogether.  In fact, I generally recommend that you *eventually* learn at least one language from the following groups:

* Low-level/systems programming: C, C++, Rust, assembly, etc.

* Applications: Java, C#, C++, etc.

* Scripting: Python, Perl, Ruby, Shell scripts, etc.

* Web:  JavaScript, PHP, etc.

* Other: this includes functional programming languages, esoteric languages, etc.  Anything that isn't really used in the professional world but still teach important concepts.";;

I suggest figuring out what interests you. You could make a graphics renderer, sudoku solver, chess AI. Go through the list of data structures on Wikipedia and make implementations of them. Eventually you'll need to learn concepts not tied to C but are low level so they're generally implemented in C/C++.";;
"Unless you're using recursion you don't need to worry. Even then there's optimizations that turn recursive functions into for/while loops.

Half of the things you're asking about - game development, languages, best practices - change quickly. Some of the most popular programming languages today were barely used at all 10 years ago and they didn't exist 20 years ago. Best practices change too - 15 years ago, most software had custom/one-off testing code if it had any at all, while today it's rare to find software that doesn't use a standard popular unit testing library, mocks, etc. And game development has changed dramatically - 15 years ago it was all about low-level coding, then it moved higher level, then as mobile exploded those low-level skills were needed again.

College courses aim to be more universal and longer-lasting than that. They aim to teach the art of programming, the math and science behind it, and the fundamentals of data structures and algorithms that form a foundation to base the rest of your knowledge on.

What you should aim to get out of a college degree should be things like:

* Object-oriented programming (universal, this applies to virtually any programming language)
* Fundamental data structures and algorithms - these are also found in all languages and useful for all problems
* Complexity analysis - how to determine the runtime and memory usage of code
* Experience with some of the major types of programming languages - for example one each of an assembly language, a compiled language like C or Java, and a dynamically-typed language like Python, plus ideally a functional language too. Even if you never use these languages, you'll know all of the major types of language so learning a new one will be easy.

What you shouldn't expect to learn:

* Software development as it's done in industry - first of all, your professors haven't been in industry in a while so they don't know, but it changes too quickly anyway - and it varies a lot depending on what type of company you work for and what type of project you work on.
* Specific programming languages - learning a new language is easy once you know the concepts. A good university should give you one example each of the different types of languages I mentioned above. If you learn Java in school, for example, picking up C# (which is used for a lot of game development) will be super easy, it will take you only a day or two to get productive and you'll have it mastered (as well as you know Java) in a month.
* Game development - it's pretty specialized. In college you could learn some of the basics, like an intro to OpenGL, but there are so many types of games and the details are so specific that there aren't many college courses that cover more than the basic intro.

As for the rest of the things you want to learn, you'll have a much easier time learning them on your own once you know the fundamentals better. The absolute best way is to learn those on the job.

If you don't care about the diploma but want excellent intro C.S. courses, have you considered MIT's open courses?

"I would go for a new technology, since that will level the playing field, as there will not be guys with 10 years of experience working on the trade competing with you.

If you have a mac, and you can spare about 100 bucks in an Apple developer account, learning iOS development with swift might be a very good idea. At least where I'm from, they are very well paid, and swift barely is barely 1 year old. It will also allow you to put some apps on the store by yourself, that at the very least will work as a portfolio.

Android would be a second good idea, although there are more devs around. And if mobile development is not for you, you can go for ""hipterish"" web technologies like ruby or angular, as the kind of companies that work with that environment tend to be of the startup type and will care more about your personal projects than about your CV.

The general rule I would tell you is: Whatever you pick, use your learning time to create a portfolio of apps.";;
"If you're looking for an entry level job, you won't be expected to know x language flawlessly. I got a job at a mid sized company knowing C, C++, Java, and Python. After my training, I was set up with Visual Studio and SQL Server Management Studio and instructed to build a website using C#, javascript/jquery, and SQL. You're going to run into a language you don't know at entry level positions.

The point to take away from this is to familiarize yourself with the concepts, rather than the syntax. Sure, knowing C++ has a handy std library for vectors and such is nice, but it means nothing when you're expected to implement an interface on 6 methods in a new language without knowing what an interface or contract is. My advice would be to go to different sites for different languages and find the topics that they all have in common. Oracle docs and Cppreference will both have something on, say, lambda functions or garbage recycling/memory management. W3 and jQuery docs will both mention the difference between document height and window height. These are the concepts to learn.

Google some of these topics, read up until you think to yourself ""so I could use it in an example like this..."", and implement a small version of it in your favorite relatable language (managing an array in python is very different from handling one in Sql, for example, so choose a more similar language, like Javascript).

Other than that, if you want to do Web Development, learn Web dev languages! If you want to make video games, learn C++ or Java! If you want to advertise yourself as cutting-edge to an employer, check out rust! Whatever language floats your boat is the language you should learn.";;

"Agreed. There are so many excellent debugging tools in the Java toolchain. Looking at the byte code would be like a carpenter using a microscope to see why a table is not level. I mean sure you could do it, but why?

I would imagine one would only look at the bytecode if one was working with the compiler itself, or looking at a deep code optimization or performance issue.";;
Precisely. Any dev who is capable of doing that effectively isn't gonna need to ask guys like me about it, that's for sure. :P;;

The problem with bytecode is that's it is not the final step. The Java Virtual Machine takes that bytecode and, while it's running, compiles it to the actual binary code that your CPU understands. During that compilation stage most of the actual optimization is done.;;
"I don't have a degree and am working full time as a software engineer. I got lucky May of last year and kind of stumbled into a contractor spot working for a friend. I was green and had no idea what I was doing. I learned most everything on the job trough trial and error and some how stayed afloat. March of this year I sensed my time was coming to an end so I started looking. I went through about 15 pages of job listings a night looking for spots that I felt I had a chance at obtaining. I compared what they were asking against what I had. If I thought I had a fighting chance, I applied. I put out about 25 or so apps/resumes. Started getting interviews directly. I used the initial interviews to tailor the ones that followed. I wrote out answers to commonly asked questions. I thought about how I could leverage my strengths. And I eventually landed a full time spot with benefits and vacation and all that good stuff. Yea I had some experience but I still only have an associates degree that has nothing to do with software whatsoever. 

  
TL:DR
Start putting out applications for things you positions you'd feel comfortable working in. What's the worst that could happen? Worst comes to worst, you've got some experience talking to employers about spots and you have an idea of what they're looking for. ";;
"You pretty much need a portfolio though. The code doesn't have to be fantastic, it just has to show your work. Anyone can have a resume full of skills they know, but having a portfolio is a far better judge of actual worth.

And about what to put in it... Put anything you want, it doesn't have to be a complete project, an app, a site. When you are browsing the internet and you have an issue, a simple script on github will show a lot.

No one ever thinks they are ready in the first job. Just be confident that you know your skill. You will learn a lot more in your first year and anyone worth working for realizes that.";;
"You dont need a portfolio. I've never interviewed for a development position and they've asked for a portfolio (I'm in the Southeast US) - the most I've ever had to do is write code on a white board or sheet of paper.

My advice for a brand new developer looking to get their foot in the door is to make sure they go to a department where the senior developers are readily available for guidance and mentoring and the company has a healthy training budget. If you get an interview where you never meet the team that you're going to be working with - Run!

Itd probably be best to seek employment at a larger company - you'll learn a lot about a lot really fast. That first job that you obtain in the industry is important for your learning, not for salary, position, or status of the company (you'll move onto something better in 2+ years)";;
"> I've never interviewed for a development position and they've asked for a portfolio

If you want a larger shot of even getting the interview, that's where the portfolio comes in.";;
You may have a point. None of the places I applied even asked for a portfolio up front. The recruiter didn't ask until after the first interview. It all depends though. ;;
Do you have a bachelor's? ;;
Only an associates. ;;
Interesting! Thanks for sharing the details.;;
"This must be a regional thing then.  I've worked with different IT recruiting agencies as well, those that make profit from you being hired, and this has also never been instructed of me.  I've honestly never seen or heard of this practice. 

With Graphic Designers or other art-related fields, or game development fields this is pretty common - but as far as I know for a software engineering position this isn't common in my area.

Note: I don't really have a problem with interviews, as far as being nervous or anything - I can rock them.  So for someone that isn't as well off with the social butt-rubbing, a portfolio could be that additional technical contribution that pushes them to get the job - I've just never thought about doing it. ";;
I agree that portfolios can be very valuable tools and I think it is good practice to have one if you do need it for an interview. However, in all of the people I talked to and interviews I did, the only person to ask for a portfolio was a single recruiter. I'm not saying that other people won't benefit from a portfolio, but I really never used mine. ;;
Better to have it and not need it, than not have it and need it.;;
Just like a condom!;;
Need one? No, but the advantages are SOME will want to see, once you get through to the second stage interview.  Having a few completed projects under your belt give you confidence to balance against experience / lack of degree.;;
Yea. When the recruiter asked for my portfolio I kind of freaked. I had a lot of smaller projects but nothing really substantial. And I couldn't really use anything from my contractor spot. Definitely panicked for awhile until I threw something together. ;;
"Tactical developer based within a business function of a very large company. I built up everything I know on the job (didn't even know SQL) and whilst I'm confident in my knowledge, I feel at an interview I'd be very crap.

What is BIDS?;;
I think getting a degree is good but a situation where you have the degree and are unable to defend it makes it seems useless. Have seen many people with degrees who cannot defend it but a lot of guys without it know more because they learning how to code was out of passion not because it was their field of study.;;
It's so troubling to me. I love learning and actually enjoy going to school. But it just seems that 99% of what I work on, I've either learned on the job or in my free time. Very little of what I've learned in school has been needed at work. I won't say it isn't valuable at all, I just feel that if I had spent that time actually writing software and reading documentation, I could be way ahead of where I am now. ;;

"Go try? You have very little to lose (some time, gas money) from going on a few interviews.

In the mean time, build something you can show off.";;
I would very strongly agree with this.  You really can't know until you go out and try.  There's no downside to giving it a shot and you will learn very quickly what people expect you to know.  You can then take those expectations and put them in a personal project that you can talk about during the interview when they ask you the questions you know they will ask you.;;
"+1 on this from me as well. I hire software engineers for a living and some of my best hires have been without degrees. While I won't say that it doesn't matter (usually applicants with CS degrees have better fundamentals and more disciplined code), it's definitely not the first thing I look at and by no means will it be the lone reason to hire or pass on a candidate. I'll look at somebody's github account before I look at the education portion of their resume. 

I would recommend just just putting yourself out there and try to get some interviews. If your hiring manager is competent, he'll know how to determine if you're a for during the interview process. And even if you're not, you'll have a good idea of how to prepare for the next one. ";;

"Just go try. I feel less than adequate about my programming skills EVEN WITH a degree. I applied to about a hundred jobs, and I only got one call back and got the job. The most important thing is your willingness to learn on the go because as a programmer, especially one that hasn't had a job yet, it's hard to find a job that 'you know what to do'. 

Also, if you do end up getting a programming. Don't quit on your first day. I was extremely close to quitting on Day 1 because I thought there was no way in hell I was going to be able to do what they asked of me and felt overwhelmed. I'm glad I didn't because I was wrong.";;

Well, that's obviously not true. You know more than zero - you're making software. That's more than not making software. Humility is nice but don't overdo it.

"About 2 of the past 5 years has been working with legacy code (mostly VS.NET and C#)

The biggest problem I've had so far hasn't been figuring out what it all does (although that does take a lot of time) it's been that the first large project I took over literally had NOT ONE COMMENT in it. I never learned to comment my code because a) I'd been the only one to ever work on my own projects and b) the first bits of anyone else' code I'd ever worked on contained no comments. And c) I'm 100% self-taught.

It simply never occurred to me that I'd ever need to explain what it was I was doing/attempting to do.

It'd taken me nearly 4 years, but I now comment religiously.";;
"I'm sure some people will argue, as this seems to be a hot debate - but I tend to reserve comments for the WHY and not the HOW. 

As an example: 

Good Comment: ""Bug Fix: Table on page DocumentView adds one additional blank row at the bottom - functionality to fix.""

Bad Comment: ""This bit of code removes the last row of the table by doing blah blah""

The first comment tells you why it was implemented, to fix a weird bug the page was having - the second comment tells you what the code does - which gives others, as well as yourself, no indication of why the code was actually added to begin with - and someone looking at this would need to investigate why the bottom row of a table was being removed in the first place.";;

"I am pretty new to programming and am not employed in the field at all but it seems to me from what I have learned so far is that anything you knew 20 or 30 years ago is pretty much useless day to day now and anything you are learning now will be useless in 20 or 30 years as both computers and code evolve. The best thing you can be as a programmer is a quick learner.

EDIT: not to say the stuff you learned long ago didn't give you a great foundation for what you are doing today but most major languages (C not inculded) aren't even as old as I am. ";;
"Yes, but if you learned to program in whatever language 20 years ago, the same concepts still apply today.

Especially in front-end web development, there's a new framework flavor of the week that's popular for awhile, then something comes along and overtakes as the new flavor of the week.

Personally, it was a motivational thing. When I seen myself learn programming languages on my own, I figured I could do it for a job. Found somewhere that needed a young go-getter, and I started a job I had very little knowledge about because I knew I was going to keep working until I got it. That was a couple of years ago.

"Just a bit of a story from my career:

I spent too long in school. I'm bad at school. I'm incredibly bad at rote memorization of things that may or may not have any real worth later on. Specifically theory courses kicked my ass. I found an internship, which turned into a full time position. A few years later, I decided I was taking a break from school (after going part time for a few years, and repeatedly failing things). 

I just started applying. Even if I wasn't entirely qualified for the job - I figured I could learn what I needed to either get past the interviews, or on the job to do the work. I was correct. 

A few things people told me: 

* Never apply for something you're entirely qualified for. You'll end up with a position doing things you already know, and not learning much. I ended up taking a job where I was mostly qualified for, and am in the process of leaving two months later. 
* The worst outcome for any application is a job. The best outcome is either them not getting back to you (because they don't realize what you're worth), or them taking time to interview you, even if you don't get it. 

I landed a pretty ok opportunity in Seattle, and then landed a very good job that starts next week. Things have definitely changed - once you get a job, finding something better seems pretty easy. ";;

"What does it even mean to say that one is ""ready"" for a job?

If you apply for a web developer position, they ask you on the job interview ""Do you know HTML?"" and you honestly say ""No"", and they hire you anyway, does that means you were ready for that particular job?

If you are a 30 year veteran and you apply for a job, and they turn you down because they had someone younger who was willing to do the same job for cheaper, does that mean you were not ready for the job?";;
By my calculations it's if you can sell your software on the white market.;;

If you are a beginner, people don't expect you to know how to do things right away, but they do expect you to learn and eventually finish the things you can't do initially.

Just don't call them programming languages because that's incorrect and people will assume you're stupid. Not condoning it but that's the way it is.

"I am not convinced it's a good way to learn. I've seen people that watch videos, tutorials and live streams for hours and hours, but never sit down and actually write code themselves.

Unfortunately programming isn't about memorizing loops and function names (videos might be good at teaching stuff like that), but it is mainly about learning to think a particular way. And you only learn that by doing.

Now, maybe in the beginning it might be helpful to see someone else code, to get an idea how to approach things, but it's no substitute for actually writing code.  

We frequently get people here that have been learning programming for a while, months sometimes, that have done exercises on interactive websites and watched videos and streams, but they are, according to their own words, unable to figure out how to work on their own projects.

I'll put a disclaimer on this and say that everybody learns differently, and who am I to tell you or others how they should learn. If these videos help you, or someone else, by all means go for it. But I'd be careful of the trap where you think you've learned a lot, but in the end are unable to actually apply anything. ";;

"Use `input.nextLine()` instead to read in an entire line.  Then, parse it to an integer -- e.g. `option = Integer.parseInt(input.nextLine());`

You may have to change the type of Exception you catch too.

`nextInt` requires more advanced knowledge of how the scanner works, but as an ELI5 example, you can imagine that you've walked up to the self-checkout lane at a grocery store, and you scan your first two items, which is a box of bananas and your rewards card.  However, the self-checkout scanner is expecting you to scan your rewards card first.

You use a loop to continually scan your box of bananas, and the self-checkout scanner keeps telling you that it wants your rewards card.

The rewards card is the 2nd item you're going to scan, but since your bananas aren't going through, the cycle just stops there.

Don't ask why bananas come in boxes; I don't know.";;

"I had to stare at this way too long... and I am still unclear:

Is the ""try"" failing at all?  He has the same debug output for the catch so its not possible to say for sure. But so confused, why would it infinitely repeat and not allow a different input?  Could it be that the first try actually seems to succeed but then the subsequent tries fail immediately?

That would make it an error uncaught somewhere inside input.readInt which expects an int, fails horribly otherwise, then blows up the object, preventing anything further submissions?

Maybe I need bed?";;
"If `input.readInt()` fails because the input isn't an int, calling the function again won't make it work.

For instance, imagine the user typed in ""bob"" instead of an integer.

Then, `input.readInt()` thinks ""well, Bob isn't an integer, so I'm going to throw an exception"".

Calling `readInt()` again will just result in the same thing: ""Bob isn't an integer, so I'm going to throw an exception.""";;
So input.readInt is still stuck on the previously entered value because its from a textbox?..  I thought it was a prompt derpidydooda... I do need bed!;;
"Haven't worked with Java's Scanner class before, but my educated guess is that it doesn't actually clear out the input when it's invalid, so you'll need to manually discard the current character.

Incidentally, it would be more concise to just move your if statement after the try-catch, or to put it in a finally block.";;
"The difference between GET and POST isn't where data can be sent. While it's more common for GET requests to use query parameters and more common for POST requests to use the request body, either one is allowed to use any mix of both.

The huge, important difference is that GET requests are required to be idempotent, which is a fancy way of saying that it's safe to call it twice - it won't change each time you call it.

Basically, a GET request should only be used to access a resource - it should never have a side effect.

Practically speaking, GET requests may be cached - by the browser, by the company intranet, by mobile web browser caching proxies, and so on. POST requests will never be cached - every time you make a POST request the client must contact the server again, and nobody else in the Internet will mess with the request or response.

Also, a GET request from a web browser will allow the user to reload the page. It may be preloaded, it may be fetched again if the user restarts the browser. A POST request will never be preloaded or fetched again if the user restarts.

So if you had a form that deletes the latest post from a forum and you made it a GET request, that'd be an awful no-no - the GET request would get called multiple times sometimes and data would be lost.

Similarly, using POST to access a large static JSON data table that rarely changes would be a huge waste of resources, because you're not taking advantage of caching opportunities.

That's the important difference. Everything else is less important.

Thanks for the explanation :). Another question, what if I want to pass credentials, but I can't use cookies due to it being a REST API. This is just a check for a resources, its safe to fire the request a million times, no side effects. Would I want to use a GET or a POST request in this case? I've been using POST so far for every API I've written.;;
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20588467/how-to-do-stateless-session-less-cookie-less-authentication;;
"Cookies are totally allowed in a REST API, especially for something like authentication. What's important is that the server should be stateless; it shouldn't be keeping track of the user's state on the server side and using the cookie as a handle to that data. The client should be keeping track of everything, but it's totally fine to use cookies as a way to pass information to the server that has to be included in every request.
";;
"POST Requests: Data can be sent using headers, or in the request body(form encoded, or json encoded(string basically)), but not in the URL. 

Pretty sure you can send it in the URL, for example:

http://example.com/cats?cat=cat

sends the variable cat with the value cat, e.g., php in the $_POST['cat'] you'll find 'cat'";;
"If that's working it's at best non-standard and shouldn't be employed. I'm not willing to dig through the RFCs and find out, but I'm pretty sure it's outright incorrect to send arguments along with the URL as part of a POST request. (Regardless of what PHP may or may not do.)

Yeah, I have never seen that anywhere. If you want arguments in the URL you go with a GET request, AFAIK. ;;

"Learning how to code an AI, or a good language to use? On the language side, you could use any to start. So I'd recommend one you're familiar with. If you intend to do a game, then something high level. The aforementioned Lua is good, as are C# and Ruby. However, something that's efficient from a technical standpoint requires a more low level language. Such as C++. Not beginner friendly. So, that just depends on where you happen to be as a programmer.


How to code an AI? That's an easy concept, notoriously difficult in practice. You're coding up behaviors, usually human behaviors. To do that, you need to understand the process behind those behaviors. A Tetris example: 

How do you decide where to put the block, and in what orientation? Do you take into account the next block? Do you factor in patterns that have been known to work well? How do you decide what to do with the first block? Is that based on the block itself, or the next block behind it? 


Annnddd so on and so forth. You are translating actions that humans take, often without so much as a second thought, and breaking them down into tangible blocks of logic that can dynamically adapt and work together to create a smooth decision making process, that isn't arbitrary and actually responds to a given situation. Which means quantifying the situation in the same way you've quantified the logic in the decision.


So.... When it comes to learning how to approach coding an AI, the best place is usually a class, mentor of some kind, or hashing through it yourself. You can learn about the concepts, but they're no good unless you figure out how to put them in code. 


Creating AI's is incredibly fun, and one of my favorite hobbies. Very rewarding. Good luck. 

";;
This is a bit of a side note, but do you possibly have any advice for how to learn how to make a program that plays a game that isn't built into the program? I've heard about a lot of programs like this and have been really interested. ;;
"Depends. If you're thinking about something like a bot, for an online game, then you need to learn how the game talks to the client side, and then emulate it. If you mean an AI that other game makers can use for their games, basically a ""plug-in"" AI, then you could create an API for for AI, and it would be up to the game maker to use that API correctly. However, it would only really be able to play games it's coded to play, unless it can take in instructions and use them on a game by game basis, and store those for future use.";;

This shows the order in which each function is called. Hopefully the numbers are legible.

An arrow pointing down and left is the first recursive call. A down and right arrow is the second recursive call. A pair of arrows pointing at the same box is the merge function, which in your example is all the crap after the recursive calls.

Just look at this and trace  through the code slowly. Multiple recursion is tricky as shit to follow but it'll click if you keep working at it.";;

"If you have

It won't immediately return. While this will:

In other words the value from the recursive call is just discarded (recursive calls are no different from calls to other functions in this regard).

For example this:

"Not really sure what you're asking, but like exoticmatter said, when you pass an array to a function, it decays into a pointer. So these two are the same:

	void func2(int* arr)
	{}

	int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};

"so when I call on the bubblesort function in the ""int main()"" part I shoulde be ok with ""bubblesort(p[0], 4);"" and p[0] will tell the function to start at element 0, while 4 will set the value for n (the variable for the total number of elements)
?

Because that throws up the same error as the OP

and I dont see what issue is created when the array decays into a pointer. Does it matter?

Oh, and the array contains elements with 2 variables. Name and age. I've managed to get a bubblesort function to work with 1 variable per element arrays. But it craps out when I use 2 variable per element arrays like this one.";;

Just my guess: sounds like your studying is way too theory heavy. The most important part of learning to code is practicing and repetition. I expect them to do exactly that. Many practice projects. Actual coding is not as mind melting as theory learning. 10+ hours is easy.;;
This is a very interesting point actually. Maybe I have been going about it a bit more theory based vs just making things. It's all new to me so I guess at this point I'm unsure how to properly learn to code.  More doing less reading. ;;
"Theory comes more into play when you're actually confident enough in your coding ability, to take a step back, and say ""Hey, there's a better way to do this I'd imagine!"".

One of the big things I see new developers try and take on is theory and best patterns/practices. Dont. Learn enough to get a few applications off the ground. Then study the more abstract concepts and reapply them by recreating the few applications you've already done. 

Your learning process should look something of the sort:

I went to a boot camp and while I have somewhat similar issues of being burnt out after 5-6 hours of focus, I forced myself to make the most of it and spent 9-10 hours per day learning or at least trying to learn. If you can do that, and you can actually use that time effectively, the camp will be worth it. If you find yourself tired of things after 4-5 hours, not only will you struggle with the camp, but you'll struggle with the job you might get afterward. ;;
If you don't mind me asking, were you able to get a job at graduation? I'd be going in with very basic programming skills. ;;
I was able to get a job within 2 months of graduation and have been employed for about a year. All but one of my co-students (not sure the best term?) had a job in a similar time period. The one who didn't was lazy and made excuses to not work hard, but is now employed and doing well. It's a valuable use of money if you want to accelerate your learning and are prepared to work your ass off. I can't stress enough that a boot camp is hard and is a way of focusing your learning, not an easy way to a high paying job. It's not for everyone. ;;
Also in case it's relevant, I went to Fullstack academy in NYC and the average salary for all the graduates was in the 70-80k range. Most are making 15-20% more than that now. ;;
It is actually. I just looked it up and saw they teach the MEAN stack, which is what this camp does (all others around teach rails). Thanks very much for your input!;;
Oh and last thing, I went in with minimal skills too. I prepped a lot in the few months leading up to going then went hardcore mode once it started. ;;
Been to one. You'll retain whatever you keep practicing. If you stop doing it after the 3 months they have you coding, you'll quickly forget it.;;
that's life bro.  adapt or get left behind ;;
If the bootcamp works with your schedule and you find the idea appealing then go for it! This will build a framework that you could pin a lot of knowledge on. ;;
IMHO these bootcamps sound ridiculous.. You would most likely be better off going to college or university and doing a course.. ;;
"They are valuable if you have the mindset where you can learn quickly in an intense environment. They aren't that different from a technical school and have a similar cost to education ratio to college courses. The key is making sure the boot camp you attend is legit and knows what they're doing.

Speed, memory consumption, etc.;;
They are much slower and use a good bit more memory. Most of the time that accuracy isn't needed so primitives work well, they're fast and light.;;
"They are much slower to work with, and they use more memory. Because arbitrary precision decimals are exact, their size tends to increase as you perform operations on them, which further increases processing time. Using exact arithmetic frequently changes the asymptotic complexity of algorithms using them - for example, adding to BigDecimals is a linear-time operation, while adding two doubles is constant time because they're always the same size. If you aren't using exact arithmetic, BigDecimals are still much slower than a double, but the asymptotic complexity shouldn't change.

Doubles offer precision that is high enough for most purposes - BigDecimals should be used if you *need* exact arithmetic (not just a very good approximation), and youdon't care about the extra processing time, or if you want decimal arithmetic rather than binary.";;
Can you describe something where you think you'd need at least 15 digits of precision and exactly why that would require at least 15 digits of precision?;;
"Some languages will ""give you that"" (i.e. big numbers by default out of the box).

Among the ""convenient high level languages"" (like java, c#, python, go, haskell, perl, php, javascript, ...), java is supposed to let you write code that is relatively efficient (in fact with the current implementations of the JVM, you can achieve high levels of performance ""given you know what you're doing""). Exclusively using big numbers would simply kill that.";;
"Most modern processors include native support for [IEEE floating point numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point). That is, there is circuitry built into the CPU specifically dedicated to processing floating point numbers. This make floating point operations very fast.

BigDecimal, on the other hand, is not natively supported. It is simulated using lower-order operations. Consequently, operations on BigDecimal fields are significantly slower than native floating-point operations.";;

"Somewhat relate the anecdote given by OP.  Learn an accurate mental model of what you're working with.

For example, there's a recent post of someone who was using a Scanner class in Java.  They wondered why it wasn't processing the next input correctly when they entered in a non-integer (the program displayed 3 choices, and asked the user to enter 1, 2, or 3).

The original poster assumed that if you provided bad input (say, the letter 'A'), then when it attempted to read via scanner.nextInt() that it would cause an exception (which it does), and discard the bad input (which it doesn't).  Thus, the same bad input was being read over and over and not being consumed by the scanner.

Now, it's true that reading the Scanner documentation might not point this out as a common problem, but it goes to show that we, as programmers, make assumptions often without realizing it (similar to making a sandwich--we assume the person reading the directions will know what a peanut butter jar is, what knife to use, etc).";;

This also takes a fair amount of work. Any non-trivial project will require time to understand.

"start with high level language. the nuances are just easier but programming at the end of the day is about a) solving problems by abstracting logic b) doing tons of research/reading to implement needed libraries to solve problems c) repeating steps a b over and over again.

"As a traditional enterprise-level desktop application developer, I feel your pain.  Recently, I inherited an old ASP.NET (no-MVC) website via a promotion and the original developer dying. 

Having never done any sort of web development, I started diving into the web development world - it was pretty much a culture shock. 

The web development community is the Wild West, and is a bit scary to someone with a career in a very solidified, standards-based development community.  I find the web development community to be really immature, scatter-brained, and unorganized as a whole.  Hopefully though, seeing developments that have come about in the last few years, that the community kind of cleans itself up and becomes more standardized with less ""new, awesome technologies"" coming out as more and more enterprise-level applications are coming to the web. 

I prefer to use well-grounded, stable technologies that don't have the sort of volatility that a lot of newer technologies have.  It's safe for me as a developer, and safe for a business' bottom-line. Most businesses don't need, nor want, the most cutting-edge technology.  They want applications that are written that can continue to be run for a decade or more.  This is better for their checkbooks. ";;
"I am not 100% sure this is the only issue, but it may be the (a) cause: 

When you execute the line:
    
    value = value

The compiler doesn't know which ""value"" you mean, the one in your class or the argument being passed into the constructor. It is probably assigning the argument in value back into the same variable. You should use the ""this"" keyword to set the value:

     Node(int value){
                 left=NULL;

Software Development is an extremely rewarding career.  90% of the time though, it's filled with frustration, outside forces dictating what you should be coding and how you should be coding it, long - sleepless nights, many hundreds of gallons of coffee and mountain dew, and eventually you'll get to the point where you've failed so much so often that you'll, hopefully, start seeing code in your sleep and begin to be considered a seasoned developer.

The great thing about a programming job is most people don't even look at college degrees, they just want to know you have an aptitude for continuing to learn and proficiency in programming.  Most young programmers, it seems, these days are focused more on mobile and web development - and honestly - that's not where the money's at if you're looking for a fat paying job. If you can handle the environment, the best paying development jobs are those writing proprietary software for enterprise-level businesses on expensive technology like Oracle/BizTalk/Cloverleaf/etc. 

I would highly suggest, that if you're looking to pursue a serious career in software programming that you start off by learning C(Not C++, just straight C) and skip the web development portion, at least in the beginning.  

If you take up web development as your first go at software development, you'll very quickly get tied down by a bunch of horribly written tutorials out there, what of the gazillion technologies you should be using, etc. 

Instead, learn and become proficient with C.  C is the basis for most programming languages out there, it will give you a great understanding of how data actually moves at the lower-levels of a computer, and will force you to learn how to write software correctly as a whole.

it swaps the place of the values inside of the variables of two elements of two arrays, Person &p, and person &q)

& points to the memory adress of the variable. So the value of variable p in the array labeled Person can be found at the memory adress

That snippet of code swappes the values of the variables at the memory adress

The code I've already written in the OP swaps the places of the elements by changing their index value

";;
"Really, the problem is exactly what the compiler says.  It expects an `operator>` to be present, and you don't have one.  You need to do something like

    bool operator>(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs) {
        // compare members
    }

It would be more idiomatic to use `operator<`, but that's just convention.";;
"You meant that I have to specify which of the variables from the class that I want to sort by? name(namn) or age(alder)?

Is that what operator is about?

So,

//inner loop searches element per element in the list
        int nrLeft = max - n; // Keeps track of nr of elements searched so far
        
        for (int j = 0; j < nrLeft; j++)
        {
                        bool operator>(Person const& namn, Person const& alder);
            if (myList[j] > myList[j+1]) //Compares elements
            {
                //Swap places
                int temp = myList[j];
                myList[j] = myList[j+1];
                myList[j+1] = temp;
            }
        }

^ That code failed

How do I even implement a bool operator? 
It isnt covered in this course";;
You just need to write some code that decides, given two `Person` objects, whether one is greater than the other.  You can treat `operator>` as a normal function, and `operator>(lhs, rhs)` should evaluate to true if `lhs` should be considered greater than `rhs`.;;
"They gave me this code to compare two person objects


    void byt(Person &p, Person &q)
    {
    Person temp;
    temp.namn = p.namn;
    temp.alder = p.alder;
    p.namn = q.namn;
    p.alder = q.alder;
    q.namn = temp.namn;
    q.alder = temp.alder;
    }

... I think I might understand it now

I get that I can use the boolean piece with an if loop to see if i should change the index places of the elements";;
That doesn't look like code that compares objects.  Compare is when you decide which is bigger.;;
"Haha, yes, you're right. See how confused I am?

How do I write code that compares objects 

How do I point out that it is the age (alder) part of the person class elements in the array that I want to compare?

The boolean code line compares lhs, rhs - but why?  
Is it lefthandside, righthandside?

Lets say I write this:

    bool operator>(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs);

It evaluates as true (or 1) if... bool operator is larger? what is happening there?";;
"Yes, `lhs` and `rhs` are short for lefthandside and righthandside respectively.

You have to write the code for comparison yourself.  For example, to compare age, you might do

    bool operator<(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs) {
        return lhs.age < rhs.age;
    }

If you want to compare something else, compare a different member.";;
"Where does lefthandside and righthandside come from, what is is lefthandside and righthandside of?

Is it lfs and rhs as in lfs is higher indexplace and rhs is lower indexplace?
";;
"They're the left and right sides of what you compare.  When you do `a > b` where `a` and `b` are both of type `Person`, that calls `bool operator<(Person const& lhs, Person const&)` with `a` being passed as the `lhs` parameter and `b` as the `rhs` parameter.

They are compared however you define the comparison.";;
"When comparing two person objects, and you're saying that you want to compare based on their age. operator> method means you're **changing** the way ' > ' works when used with Persons. Within an operator> function (like /u/jesyspa originally gave) you need to give logic that compares the ages. For example:

    bool operator>(Person const& lhs, Person const& rhs){
    if (lhs.alder > rhs.alder) // *or whatever you stored age as*
    {
       return true;
    }
    else return false;


Something like this. Does that make sense? The code you have in your latest comment makes no sense, it's just the declaration...
";;
"Note that

    if (foo)
        return true;
    else
        return false;

is an antipattern in sanely-typed languages.  You want just

    return foo;

or

    return bool(foo);";;
I'll point to you here, it's been a while since I've been in C++;;
"Its a wash anyway since I dont think that I am allowed to use the boolean code to compare in this particular program on this particular assignment :S

I'll use it on the next assignment though. Its going to be a compilation of all the terminal programs I've written so far. With a menu and userdefinable variables where its needed.";;
"There's already a standard linux program that does this. It's called `cat` (short for ""concatenate""). If your intentions are to utilize this functionality, you should use the standard program. Windows users can get it with Cygwin (and probably MinGW).

Example usage:

    # Writes the concatenated files to standard output
    cat file1.txt some/path/file2.txt /home/mike/file3.txt

    # Writes the concatenated files to a file
    cat file1.txt file2.txt > concatenated.txt

>I am not sure about how'd it know where to place that file.

You'd have to specify that. You currently have mere strings and would have to write those to a new file. But it's better to write to stdout and then let io redirection allow writing to a file (as shown above) so that you can also use the program in a pipe (eg, `cat file1.txt file2.txt | grep ""search query""`).

If none of my post makes sense to you, I highly recommend spending some time learning the command line, first. Not only is it great for productivity, but many things do not have a GUI approach (so you must know the command line). As well, when creating a command line program as you are, without knowing the command line, you'd end up wasting time implementing things that the command line can already do for you.

Even more, you might create a program that can already be done with other programs (such as `cat`, as shown above) or a combination of other programs. You may also end up writing programs that are very inefficient for your workflow. One common mistake beginners often make is to have a ""press enter to exit"" at the end of their program, which prevents you from easily using that program in scripting and ultimately stems from a misunderstanding of how to use the command line.";;

Even if the end result was a steaming pile of mess, it was my steaming pile of mess. I could go back to refine and reinforce it, make it better than before, and that fact itself is what keeps me interested and passionate about learning new things. With each new thing, it opens up new pathways for how I can improve my program. 

For instance, 3 months ago, I knew nothing of concurrency, and always shied away from multi-threading topics because, hell, why bother when a single-threaded terminal application works just fine? Now I focus on making all of my projects thread safe and make use of multi-core processing power whenever possible. 

It's only recently that I'm delving into networking as well, as both concurrency and networking seem to go very well together, and I hope to create better, and more efficient programs.

Or look through recent bug fixes and add unit tests for the code that was fixed.

Testing currently or recently broken code,  and recent changes is going to be of potentially more use that picking some code at random and testing that.

  2 .  If there is anything related to explicit security,   user-input,  network input,   then bugs found new tests there are going to be more valuable than testing, for example, the UI";;
"> Fix bugs and add unit tests for the now-fixed code.

I would suggest the other way around. Write a unit test for the code as it should be. The unit test should be red before you fix the bug and green after you've fixed it.";;
Good point,   that is a better idea.;;
"I don't know any frameworks to use for ASP.NET so I hope you get an answer to that. But for your second question, at the place I'm working all of our unit, functional and integration tests are integrated to Jenkins so they are run every time we create a build.

Also at least the JavaScript tests can be used on autowatch so everytime you change something and save, it runs the tests. But that's used mostly when you refactor something.";;
"Unit testing legacy applications can be very hard when you're new at it, especially if the apps wernt designed with testing in mind.

Testing an MVP asp.net webforms site is a lot easier than testing a regular webforms mess.

To get started id suggest you try on a new project. Write tests first, use an IOC container for dependency injection (unity perhaps).

That will be much easier, then when you have got your head around testing think about testing the legacy stuff";;
"> I need to find projects to do , I have creativity problems and can't come up with new ideas to do

Find sites that already exist (particularly ones that you think are well-designed or whose designs have really interesting elements) and see if you can recreate them (or aspects thereof). Lots of things can be done with just HTML and CSS.

If you've got design skills (or even if you don't), think about redesigning old or unattractive sites so that they work well on mobile devices. The world is full of poorly designed sites that only work on full-screen devices.

> yes I would like to make a coin toss heads/tails type of website that has bitcoin betting that gives the losers coins to winners but I think that can not be done with pure html/css

"It's not worth reducing variables used in most cases. The difference in performance is minimal and readability is WAY more important. Some people really understate how important readability is. Code exists to be read by humans.

"> The difference in performance is minimal

And usually not present. Inlining and simplifying expressions is a big part of what an optimising compiler does. However, in this case, the intermediary step is probably needed anyway. The JVM is a stack machine, so both cases would compile to something like:

    push first_number
    push second_number
    push third_number

You have semicolons after each if statement. This evaluates the if statements and throws away the result, then executes the block below the statements. Remove the semicolons and you should be in good shape.;;

No problem! Whether you forget them, or add extra, semicolons always seem to have it out for programmers.;;
"Your conditional statements here are structured poorly. Rather than three completely separate `if` statements, you should be writing this as an `if`–`else if`–`else` structure:

    if (yournumber == 7)
    {
        cout << ""You guessed my number\n"";
    }
    else if (yournumber > 7)
    {
        cout << ""Your number is too high!\n"";
    }
    else
    {
        cout << ""Your number is too low\n"";
    }

This has at least three advantages:

1. If the first condition (`yournumber == 7`) is true, then there is no need to test the other conditions, because they will certainly be false. The three conditions are mutually exclusive. In the code that you wrote, all three conditions will always be tested, because you have written three totally separate `if` statements. That is at best inefficient; in a different context, it could be a serious bug. In the `if`–`else if`–`else` structure, if `yournumber == 7` is true then the rest of the conditional structure will be skipped completely; and in the worst case only two conditions are tested (`yournumber == 7` and `yournumber > 7`), rather than three.

2. An `if`–`else if`–`else` structure guarantees that exactly one of the three blocks will be executed. This matches the behavior that you intend for the code to have. It also means that the compiler will be able to use this structure to reason better about the code, perhaps catch more bugs or do better optimizations or suppress warnings that aren't actually worrisome.

3. With an `if`–`else if`–`else` structure, the compiler would have told you about your extraneous semicolons, because the `else if` and `else` parts would not have a previous `if` statement to go with them (because it was terminated by the semicolon).";;
"Also, just a coding tip, you might replace the literal number 7 in all of your if statements with your variable ""mynumber"". Otherwise, the variable ""mynumber"" is useless in this code. And, if you want to change your number later, using the variable will allow you to change it in one place instead of changing it in all of your if statements. ";;

"Newb programmer myself but heres a couple pointers:

Start declaring your variables inside the main function. Global variables ( variables outside a function ) are frowned upon.  When you are programming multi function programs ( not hard to learn btw), youll see why.

DON'T hardcode variables. Like YTVF said, in this program use mynumber in your if statements, not 7.
Imagine if you wanted to change the number to 8.  Its a simple program, and thats already alot of work to change instead of simply declaring int mynumber = 8;

As a cool project , try going to cplusplus.com and implementing the random function to make a random number for your game.  This will teach you many useful skills, like declaring header files for a new library, and reading documentation for existing code so you can implement it.  HINT: you're using namespace std, so you can remove ""std::"" out of any code you find.

Some of this advice may be a bit strict looking but professors at school drilled it into me because it helps you understand program structure at a much higher level.

Good luck

It might take you a few months if you're starting from no experience, but you gotta start somewhere.


If you want to do this yourself, here's the concepts you'd need to learn:

-Basic HTML (including the DOM, etc) -- this is what the page you're scraping is made from. You'd need to understand this stuff before you can really do anything.

-Basic Javascript and JQuery -- this is what you'd use to locate specific elements in the page (ie the lineup table), traverse through their child elements (ie each row containing the player information), and extract the needed information.

-Ajax (using jQuery; really this could be lumped in with the previous step) -- this is what you'd need to use to retrieve the data (ie the HTML page) from the website.

With these tools you can build a pretty basic web scraping application. Along the way, you can pick up on other stuff like styling with CSS, or creating a backend using PHP/Rails/Django or whatever else.

Otherwise, if you're serious about paying someone to do this for you... feel free to send me a message.";;

"The main limitation is speed - a native app runs several times faster.

There's other problems as well, for example limited access to the file system, limited access to hardware acceleration and lack of libraries (and languages) to do traditionally native things.

You can do more in web apps than ever before, but if your app is even slightly performance sensitive then you need native code.";;
">When should you build apps this way instead of building a native app?

It can make sense when the app requires a complex GUI that can be created quicker with HTML/CSS/JS and the performance constraints isn't an issue. It can also be useful if you already have a good deal of functionality available in HTML/CSS/JS (eg, from a website).

It's very important to keep the performance scaling in mind, though. If you may be needing performance in the future, this choice could be a major constraint. Fortunately, many simple applications don't care much about performance and that is unlikely to change.

>Can you use these languages to make games and distribute them through steam and/or mobile app stores?

Sure. You'll need special frameworks for mobile, though, like [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com/).

>What would be the best way to get started today if I wanted to start building things other than websites?

Depends totally on how your programming skills are. I've seen a lot of people who only know HTML/CSS/JS and they can't actually program. They can hack together some basic DOM modifications, but that's about it. If that's the case, you'll probably want to learn how to program, first.

Otherwise you can pretty much just jump into creating the application. Do whatever tutorials the framework offers (since you'd need a framework of some kind to utilize HTML/CSS/JS in a desktop app) and build on to that.";;
"Yes there is... You'll probably want to have a method in the GUI class that manages the listbox that calls the Database class requesting data.

There's a lot of ways to do it, depends on what you like to do and what your code structure looks like.";;
"The code I'm currently using to read from the database and populate the listbox is this. Mostly what I want to do is just move it to another class to get the foreach statement out of the form class, trying to separate logic, like loops, and of course sql from the form class.
            

     DataTable dt = SQLAccess.SelectFromTable();

"This is more of a list of things to work toward as a beginner to tailor yourself for a less-frustrating future.

* If the company, if you do, work for doesn't currently have a coding style guide, make one for yourself. (How you go about naming variables/methods/classes, how comments are laid out, etc). Consistency in writing code is key for less confusion in the long run.

* Don't use comments to tell what you're application is doing, self-documenting code should be the ultimate goal, instead save commenting your code for WHY you implemented that code in the first place. This will make it much easier for you and other coders to read your work.

*Learn to break up your code into manageable chunks, same with thinking about problems. This may seem like a 'duh' skill, but its one of the hardest skills to get REALLY good at - especially foreseeing problems before you write a single line of code.

*Learn to step through chunks of your code as you complete them, preferably with breakpoints in debugging tools. This will help you catch logical errors before your customers do.

*When beginning solutions from scratch, try and write a logging system that will output a log file with pass or fails as you write portions of your application. For complex applications, most debuggers can't be trusted - and you'll save yourself hours of hunting for silly little bugs when you can look at some simple pass/fail notifiers in a text file. 

*Even if its a personal project, write code as if everyone in the world is going to critique it. At some point in your career, you will have wrote an application that you thought was just going to be a personal project - and it will turn into something greater that many other people will look at, contribute to, or maybe even inherit.";;
"This is a better way (that actually works) to pass parameters to a callback. Although I'm not really a web guy so if someone knows better please chime in.

"You have some options: make that var att global and stop trying to pass it as an argument in the callback.  You could also attach it as a new attribute on the input button's DOM too, that way you have a unique ""attempts"" field for each input.  https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/ is designed for this type of stuff.

The problem is, ""att"" no longer exists once the ""page ready function"" event has finished running, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11152977/global-javascript-variable-inside-document-ready

Romple is showing a method to use an anonymous function to wrap the actual callback function and get a parameter to work, but I believe the value will be undefined in his example.  Also it will be passed by value as it is a primitive type, so you will need to return it to something at some point...  I am a little rusty though so try it out and let us know would ya!

"Naming conventions everyone understands so the user/developer knows what's in them without needing to figure anything out of dig through them. Nothing more.

* lib - libraries, collections of stuff that help you do other stuff in your code
* bin - binaries, commands, and general purpose scripts
* src - main source folder
* dist - distribution - the application that is ready to be shipped out
* build - source code built, but not ready for distribution

None of these are required and can be mixed and matched and named anything the developer wants. Like I said, just a naming convention.

Writing code that can be easily supported, modified, and extended in the future by you and other people, without  needing to deconstruct everything every time, takes a lot of work.";;

"> The general consensus from this subreddit is saying, ""stick with one language and learn as much as you can""...so I signed up for a bunch of courses on Udemy (How to become a web developer from scratch, beginner PHP course, beginner Python course, beginner Ruby course),

So you completely ignored the advice?";;
my apologies, i worded that incorrectly...i had signed up for a bunch of courses due to them being cheap at the time...and then heard from commentors on reddit, that sticking to one language is the best way to go.;;
"Almost nobody writes things like `startwith`. It's just too hard to read in general, since you can't tell where words start and end. The three most common naming schemes are:

* PascalCase: `XmlFileReader`, `StartWith`, `SwapCase`
* camelCase: `xmlFileReader`, `startWith`, `swapCase`
* snake_case: `xml_file_reader`, `start_with`, `swap_case`

Different languages have different conventions. For example, C# uses PascalCase for class and member names, and camelCase for local variables. Python uses PascalCase for class names and snake_case for everything else. Best to follow conventions so that your code will be consistent with the standard library and third party code.

There's sometimes inconsistencies. I think it's a stupid move on the part of the creator, but you'll just have to deal with it. Python seriously suffers from this problem (not to mention the mixing of iterative and OOP conventions with `len(list)` where most OO languages would do `list.length()`). Scala, on the other hand, is very consistent.";;
Well python write them like that. For me, Ruby naming is quite inconsistent without good reason for it. Please correct me if I am wrong.;;
"I don't know Ruby well enough to say (my extent of using Ruby is merely to answer a few questions here), although the fact that they named their ""print"" statement ""puts"" says a lot about Ruby's naming things.";;

"We don't really know the context so hard to say.   The best type of dynamic array would be one that you wrote specifically for your application.       

Don't know why you think void pointers will slow it down.  Personal opinion: don't use macros. They will become a headache if you decide to modify how it works in the future.";;
If you have an array of void pointers it will slow your application down because each value in the array will (probably) be allocated on the heap separately.;;
Are the elements of variable size?    Memory allocation in C is very fast.  I wouldn't let that impact my decision unless it is clear you need the absolute speediest implementation possible.  Fastest and generic are generally mutually exclusive, btw.  ;;
Well... Not when using macros........;;
"What are you storing?  It's hard to tell if you really want help with that answer.      

A good solution depends on knowing what you are storing.  A dynamic array can be as simple as:

    type *a = calloc( num, sizeof( type ) );     

    if x >= num     
        num = someNewCleverSize     
        a = realloc( a, sizeof( type ) * num)    

    a[ x ] = typeThing         

Just wrap in a few functions and Bob's your uncle.     

If the element size is dynamic, create an array of pointers instead and allocate the contents.  Your realloc then just creates more space for pointers.  Add some bits to free up memory as needed and you're good to go.";;
Right now I'm thinking of using macros also because I need to use strings, however I could just have two separate data structures for strings and arrays.;;
"Making blanket statements about performance is rarely useful.

If you are doing many inserts and deletes then, yes, heap overhead may become measurable.

If, however,  you have a large array that you want to sort,  then swapping pointer sized elements may be quicker than swapping structures.

Until you know that something is a performance bottleneck, don't worry about it.

In 99% of projects,  micro-optimisations like this are completely unneccessary.";;
Are you sure you understand what it's doing?  It's certainly possible to make an array where the elements are contiguous but accessed/manipulated by void pointers (since C doesn't have templates).;;
C# is a great one in my opinion. The forms designer in the .NET languages is super helpful for beginning programmers and C# is really well supported and widely used, however if you have experience in Python I would probably continue forward with that. It's super relevant, widely used, has a hugely helpful community, and about 234098234 libraries and frameworks out there to work with (Django being a big one). It's kind of a matter of preference, but I would continue forward with Python.;;
Awesome, thanks for the feedback! I think I'll have a little foray into C# (just to get at least some understanding of it) then look at expanding on my Python knowledge long-term.;;
Sounds like a plan. I love C#, personally. I work with the .NET languages all the time, and C# has a lot of really good features and nice syntax in my opinion.

"It's generally better to use the full range of HTTP verbs when possible. That way, you can minimize the amount of URLs you need to create (want to delete a resource? Instead of having to send a POST request with data or call some alternate URL, just send a DELETE request). The other advantage is that it gives you more flexibility -- you have a wider range of primitives to work with instead of trying to stick everything inside a GET or POST request. (For example, if you have GET, PUT, and DELETE, you almost design your API to act as a map -- the url is the key, and you can retrieve a resource with GET, replace it with PUT, and delete it with DELETE, and use POST for when you need to do extra stuff).

That said, since GET and POST were the most popular options for a long period of time, it can sometimes be a bit more convenient to just stick to those two -- for example, I believe jQuery has `get` and `post` methods, but no `put` and `delete` -- you need to use the `ajax` method and do a little extra work if you want to use those two.

";;
">I believe jQuery has get and post methods, but no put and delete -- you need to use the ajax method and do a little extra work if you want to use those two.

What? jQuery uses ajax. You'd use something like:

    $.ajax({
        url: 'foo/bar',
        type: 'DELETE',
        // ...
    });

This will work in all the remotely modern browsers, and thus can be effectively considered supported everywhere.";;
"Right -- like I said, you need to use the `ajax` method in order to send PUT and DELETE requests. In contrast, you can use the following shortcuts for GET and POST:

    $.get(""/my/endpoint"", function(data) {
        console.log(data);
    });

    $.post(""/other/endpoint"", {""foo"": ""bar""})
        .done(function(data) {
            console.log(data);
        });

It's a small shortcut, and the ajax method isn't really all that longer, but I know that there have been times where I've personally been really lazy + have been biased towards using GET and POST just so I could type fewer characters, which is why I brought it up as a potential factor.";;
Ah, I see. Didn't know there was `get` and `post` methods. I could have used those in my last job.;;
"Use what you need to.  There's no sense in implementing DELETE for a route if the entity cannot be deleted.  More significant is publishing documentation so consumers know how your API is shaped.

As for PUT and POST, I'm curious how your textbook is positioning the 'debate.'  PUT is used to update an existing entity; POST to create an entity that does not exist.  

";;
"What do you mean by ""main class""?";;
"public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(""Hello, World"");
    }

}
";;
That's the main **method**. Conceptually speaking, a _method_ is a **function** that's part of a class. In this case, part of `HelloWorld`.;;
"Is the whole thing the main method or just this bit? 

public static void main(String[] args) {

    System.out.println(""Hello, World"");
}



Does the initial HelloWorld class, with the main method have any significance over a (random class)duck created class I create? Should it be treated differently? ";;
"No. The class could be used for literally anything. You just gotta have a main method somewhere in your program to run it. You could place it inside your Duck class and still use the class inside the main method like any other class. Usually people move the main method to a class of its own and give it a name like ""Program"" or something so that other people scrolling through your code can easily find the entry point of your program.";;
"No, just that bit is considered the `main` method. It's also worth nothing that the `HelloWorld` class itself has no special significance -- it might contain a method named `main` with a specific type signature, but otherwise it's exactly the same as any other class.

And in fact, you can have multiple files and classes in your program that all have `main` methods, and unless you explicitly call them, they won't do anything special. 

To be more specific, what Java will do is when you instruct it to run a class, it'll check and see if it contains a 'main' method. If it does, it runs it. If not, it gives an error. If you wanted, you could create multiple files/classes with main methods, and instruct Java to run a different class (and it'll check to see if it has a main method, etc...). 

";;
"What language are you using?

Traditionally (read: in C) the function *main()* is where the program starts executing.";;
Java. I know that it is where the program starts. But as its a class its a blue print of an object? Perhaps I am looking where I don't need to look.;;
"Then, as others have said, it's similar to C.

There is no 'main class', there is a main function - the class it's in is irrelevant, it acts only as an entry point to the program.

Does it make sense now?";;
"Also of note is that there can be multiple main methods. You could have one in every class, if you wanted. To choose which to use as the entry point, you'd use `java my.package.ClassName`. IDEs should have some means of choosing the class to use, too.

It's also possible to have entry points without a main method. Eg, Android doesn't use main methods. Similarly, the JUnit unit testing framework allows any test class (with the appropriate annotations) to be run directly.";;
"I understand thanks.

";;
"Depends on the language.  In Java, for example, everything is an object.  C++, on the other hand, is an object-orientated language which allows some code to be written without using the OO approach.

So - 1) what language are you talking about, and 2) What do you mean by ""main class.""

>Are all objects things ? are some objects actions?

Good question.  My opinion is, all classes should be things.  IE, nouns.  Actions are methods on a class.

Now to consider your ""add two numbers together"" example...  The best implementation really depends on what exactly you're trying to do, but for a construed example:  Maybe you make a ""NumberAdder"" class - ""NumberAdder"" is a noun, a number adder is a thing which adds numbers together.  You could then make a variety of methods on that class that allow addition to occur.";;
"Thank you very much you have answered my question. I am using Java. Below is an example of what I mean by the main class(just hello world). This seems to be the wrong term. If you could please tell me what the correct term is I would be grateful.

Which language? Could you show a bit of your existing code for a bit of context?;;
It's in Java, I added my code to the description. I have the for loops I used to populate each array. I checked those and they work. And I used selection sort on the array of course averages. But I just don't know how to do that and get the associated names and other scores to switch to the correct positions too.;;
If your arrays are all of the same size, when sorting your `courseAverageArray` in the `sortArray` loop, move the elements of all the other arrays as well (instead of only the one array passed to the method).;;
Personally i think your current Design is good and better than the one you want to implement. ;;
That's good to hear thanks. I am self taught so I am still experimenting with design and all that. SO I always try to think through a new design as completely as I can.;;
I would actually recommend learning Java from a book. Like Ektastrophe says, Head First Java is a great book for getting started. I learnt Java programming from Head First Java myself. However, if you prefer learning online, I recommend learnjavaonline.org because it is interactive. ;;
Okay I'll check those out! Thank you! ;;
"Nothing I know of that's explicitly like CodeCademy for Java. What I might suggest instead is a good book (""Head First Java"" is pretty easy to track down and usually costs about $25) followed by the exercises on CodingBat once you learn how to write methods.";;
I have used a book for a little bit but the only problem I find is I find my self just copying the book and never really learning anything, is there something I'm doing wrong?;;
"Copying from the book is the first step. Then go back and take a look at it; take notes. Use comments to explain your code. See if you can figure out what each line of code does. Try finding a new way to write the same line of code. Try modifying it.

Ultimately, the thing to do is play around with it, albeit at least sort of methodically. You won't irrevocably break anything. You won't hurt anyone. Worst case scenario, you'll have to go back and copy the code out of the book again and/or you'll maybe waste an hour or two.

(Later, you can learn how to use Git to help make it much easier to recover from borking your entire code base. For now, the ""undo"" feature works just fine).

If you want something a bit more methodical, [Learn Java the Hard Way](https://learnjavathehardway.org/) is also a fine resource. It's much more limited in scope than Head First Java, but that tightness of focus also helps a bit. The first 16 chapters are available for free so you can try it out. By the time you finish up Chapter 34 or so, you should be ready to tackle CodingBat's exercises.";;
See your comment makes complete sense. But I get this feeling of dread when I try to do that method because I simply don't know any other way to do something. I am limited to the knowledge of what I have learned previously. I want to be able to mess around or try new things but I don't know all the syntax and stuff so that's where I get frustrated. I feel like a monkey not a programmer in progress. I can only copy. ;;
"How is that different from codecademy? You get better by practicing, books can be helpful because they have problems for you to solve at the end of each chapter.

> I want to be able to mess around or try new things but I don't know all the syntax and stuff so that's where I get frustrated.

Sites like codecademy don't let you try new things, you have to type everything exactly how they want it. If you're learning from a book and you want to try something new you can always flip the page.
[Here](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/thinkapjava.pdf)is the book we used for our data structures class. It is aimed at high school AP classes but it's good for learning syntax.

I learned Java looking over class examples while doing homework assignments. You don't need to memorize syntax to be a ""programmer in progress"", as long as you're able to solve the problem you can always look at the documentation to see what the syntax is. ";;
Okay I see where you're coming from, I'll try to look at some of the problems. Any tips on how to work on getting the problems when you're new and not really used to breaking down problems? ;;
The book should tell you what you need to know unless it is a crappy book. Don't over think the problem. If you're on chapter 1 and it tells you to print x y times, it's not expecting a loop. If you're learning for a class look for an old syllabus and try to get the book and go over the stuff the syllabus says.;;
Copying is fine at the very start, but you need to do the exercises. A couple of exercises from each chapter will be useful. For books without exercises, you should play around with the code you just learned. Eg, if you learned how to use a loop, then you'd try utilizing that in a few ways (eg, print out the number 1 to 100; keep asking the user for a number and adding that to a sum; etc).

A nice exercise: for a set of poker hands determine which are the winning ones. Simple, but non-trivial.;;
"Good idea, but it does get tricky quickly.  There are many ways to model playing cards, and they have different implications.  The best way to model cards in computer memory isn't necessarily a good representation of how they work in real life, and this can be extremely confusing for a beginner.  

The first aggregate data structure you encounter in most languages is an array. Arrays (typically) have a fixed size, and the size cannot be changed during a run of the program.

The way humans uses playing cards is more like a stack, which is a more complex data structure often not taught until later in computing. 

I give an assignment in my CS1 class where I have students model a set of playing cards with a very simple integer array, and it's amazing how many ways they over-complicate the exercise.  

Before you understand stacks, the best way to do this is not to store an array of cards at all, but to store an array of card _locations_.

The other thing that confuses people is the nature of card names (Three of clubs) leads you to think cards should be a two-dimension array.  While this often makes sense, you should be good at single dimension arrays before you go to 2D, and you can always use some simple math tricks to determine a suit and rank if you know the card number.";;

Are you trying to take instructions in natural language and turn them into a technical specification, or take the specification and turn it into code?;;
"Nah, i want a language to formally describe the specifications and then automatically process it to get something compilable/runnable. No natural language processing, that would be too insane =).

I know that there's UML which can possibly be used for formal description of anything. But it's graphical, and i am not sure it's a good idea to base a code generator on such a thing. Or am i missing something here?";;
"Basically you want a declarative language, which declares what you want and not how to get it. SQL is an example. Although the sheer complexity of this means that anything non-trivial will require some pretty abstract SQL code (in that it doesn't really represent the specification in a readable way).

And SQL's declarative nature also makes it limited, which is why languages like pl/pgSQL (PostgreSQL's procedural language for database interactions) exist.

SQL as a language also only works because there's an enormously complicated DBMS (database management system) that interprets and executes the SQL.";;
"> Anyway. here's the deal. I'm working on a code generator project that would be able to facilitate creating code using the user-defined goals and pre-created technical patterns of achieving them. For this, i am required a tool to create those technical patterns and automate following them when processing the ""user stories"" into machine instructions.

Can you come up with any concrete examples of this?";;
"Nope, that's why i'm here and looking for suggestion about the tools.
My current dilemma is to create some custom solution where i would have to invent the format of storing the data - or, if there are already tools like i asked about, to use them for the same purpose. So, right now i don't have any code to show simply because having it would mean that i already took the ""custom tool"" road.

Or you mean something concrete, yet not code-bound?";;
Yes, by concrete examples, I mean something concrete.;;
"Alright, let me put it this way.
Let's say we're developing an Android app. The user story is ""i want an app with a single screen which has an edit box and a Send button, so when i press the button the Email app opens, with the email text being pre-set to what was in the edit box"".

The system i want to have would transform it into the declaration of a proper layout, definition of the activity and instantiation of the proper intent.
To do it, i must first define the rules, by which the user stories are translated into the intermediate technical instructions, and i need a code generator itself to produce output text files (classes, manifest, resources etc) based on the technical instructions.

The question is: are there any software products aimed at providing the tools of creating such rules?

If the example i made didn't clear things for you, then i don't know what else to tell you regarding your question. Because if all this doesn't ring any bell to you, then my question is probably for someone else to answer ;).";;
It sounds like you want a DSL that covers layout and program logic.  What benefits do you think this will have over programming an android app normally?;;
"It's not gonna be just a DSL for layouts.
And the point is that once you create a proper framework, i.e. that specification description language is rich enough to describe any user story imaginable, the application development only requires a spec to be written down - the rest is automated.
Which includes the use of proper patterns, the platform quirks that are easy to forget or mishandle, and other stuff.";;
So what exactly is your question?;;
"Sorry about being vague, I would like to know how I can make this happen (Bigger image and text appears when someone clicks the thumbnail in mixitup)

How can i create the appearing and changing part? (Sort of like an image gallery thing)";;
The easiest way is to put all your images on top of each other and hide all the others except for your active image. Then when an image is chosen, you set the new image's opacity to 0, show it, then animate their opacities. That's easy with CSS transitions.;;
Alright man i'll try it that way, but wont that cause the page to be super slow since it has to load all the images on load?;;
Yes, but my suggestion was a basic one to get you started in the right direction. If you wish to download the images only after you click on them, you can just fade out the image (css transition on opacity) and the text element, then fade them back in with the right image sources and text when the download is complete.;;
"Again, **headers are for declarations only**. The entire purpose of their existance is to declare functions and variables that are defined in .c source files. That's why they are not named .c but .h. They way you have it all your files should be named .c.

The structure of your code is very confusing. There is a function called `genQuestions()` which apparently does everything except ask the initial two questions. It also takes two parameters `rAnswers` and `indicator` which are always 0; one is never used but is reused as a local variable, the other is only passed on to the function `answerQuestion()`, which also doesn't use it but reuses it as a local variable, which it sets once and then never uses again. At the end of `genQuestions()` you also print the return values of `answerQuestion()` and `reply()`, both of which unconditionally return 0, and that's why you get two zeros printed in your output.

Explain what your thinking was with these things.
";;
I am still very new to the c language, so I am doing what made sense to me. *RAnswers* and *indicator* are supposed to be passed between the files as a sort of global variable that is like how the variables *difficulty* and *response* were used.;;
"But they're not global variables, they're function parameters. You are just passing the value 0 in at the start. `genQuestions()` never uses the value of `RAnswers` that was passed in, but sets it to a new variable. Then you pass the new `RAnswers` to `answerQuestion()` along with the same 0 you got in `indicator` to begin with.

`answerQuestion()` never uses the value in `indicator`. It just sets it to a new value, which it also doesn't use.

Also, `answerQuestion()` never communicates anything back to genQuestions(). It always returns 0, and in any case all you do with the returned value is print it. So `genQuestions()` doesn't find out about whether the answer was correct.

Then you call `reply()` without any parameters, but `reply()` actually takes one parameter, called `indicator`. So you have undefined behaviour there. If you were to call it as `reply(indicator)`, you would simply be calling it with the same value 0 that you received from `main()`. `reply()` doesn't have a case for 0, so it wouldn't do anything.

You should probably change your functions so that the values they return are actually meaningful. For example, `answerQuestion()` could return whether the answer was correct or not, and then `genQuestions()` could use that value as the parameter for `reply()` to tell it what to print.

`genQuestions()` is a pretty bad name, by the way. Something like `playGame()` would probably be better.
";;
Well then I don't know what I need to do in order to pass the proper variable values to the right functions. the name for genQuestions is a required name I have to use.;;
"> Well then I don't know what I need to do in order to pass the proper variable values to the right functions.

Define what information the functions need to have in order to work, declare those parameters, pass those parameters.

So, does `genQuestions()` need the 0 it gets passed as `indicator`? I would say probably not, given that it is always 0. Does it need the 0 passed to it as `RAnswers`? Certainly not, because it changes the value of that variable without ever looking at the value before that.

On the other hand, doesn't `reply()` need to be passed a parameter? It is declared as taking one parameter, so it certainly must be passed some kind of value to avoid undefined behaviour. If you fix your code up so that you have a header with declarations for all the functions that you include everywhere, the compiler will refuse to compile because of that missing parameter, pointing it out to you. You should probably be passing some value returned by `answerQuestion()`, indicating if the player answered the question correctly or not.

That brings us to a more important point: Define what information it is that each function is supposed to provide to the caller. What information is it each function *produces*? That is what they need to return, and the caller needs to do something with it.
";;
"Well, in `main` you are printing the return value of `genQuestions`, and `genQuestions` always returns&nbsp;0, so that will print&nbsp;`0`. In `genQuestions` you are printing the return values of `answerQuestion` and `reply`, and those functions always return&nbsp;0, so those `printf` statements will print&nbsp;`0`.

The return values of your functions are not meaningful, so don't print them. Just *call* the functions—don't call them and then print the return values.";;
How would you suggest editing the code then, because I don't understand what you my by just calling them. When I do not include the return 0; the compiler gives me an error.;
"    printf(""%d"", genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator));

You are calling the `genQuestions` function there and then sending its return value to `printf`. You don't want to send the return value to `printf`, because the return value of `genQuestions` is always&nbsp;0, and there's no reason to print&nbsp;`0`.

Just call `genQuestions`:

    genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator);

And if you aren't going to do anything with the return value of `genQuestions` anyway, then why is it returning anything at all? There's no need for `genQuestions` to return&nbsp;0 if you aren't going to ever do anything with that value:

	int genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator)
	{
		/* ... */
		return 0;
	}

Why does `genQuestions` return an `int`? What is the meaning of the integer it returns? The integer has no meaning—it's always&nbsp;0. So there's no reason to return anything at all. Declare `genQuestions` to be `void`, meaning that it returns nothing, and take out the `return 0;` statement.

	void genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator)
	{
		/* ... */
	}";;
"That fixes the issue of printing zeros, yet now the output is just this:

* How many questions for this test (1-20)? 2
* 
* Select difficulty (1-4): 1
* Question 1: 6 - 10 =
* Enter Answer: -4
* Question 2: 2 + 1 =
* Enter Answer: 3
";;
"Well, why do you expect it to print anything between the first ""Enter Answer"" line and the ""Question 2"" line? Exactly what line of your code do you think should be printing something there?";;
I am expecting it to call on the function reply and tell me whether or not the answer was correct.;;
What do you mean? Point to the place in your code that you think should be doing that.;;
In the function *genQuestions* it calls upon *answerQuestion* then *reply*, and what I was looking for those to do is print out the question, check to see if the answer is correct, then tell the user if it was correct or not.;;
"You call `reply` in `genQuestions`, but you don't pass any argument to `reply`. The `reply` function requires one argument, because you have declared it as

    int reply(indicator)

which should probably be

    int reply(int indicator)

but you aren't giving it an argument when you call it. That means that your program has undefined behavior, which means that you have absolutely no guarantees about the behavior of any part of your program.

If `reply` requires one `int` argument, as you have declared it, then you need to pass it one `int` argument when you call it. You can't call it as `reply()`, because you aren't giving it an argument there.

Apparently the `reply` function should be passed the integer 1&nbsp;or&nbsp;2, depending on whether the user's answer was right or wrong. How is the `genQuestions` function supposed to know whether the user's answer was right or wrong in order to pass `reply` the correct argument? It can't know, because `answerQuestions` doesn't return any useful value. The `answerQuestions` function assigns a value to the *local* variable `indicator`, but that variable disappears when the `answerQuestions` function returns. If you want `answerQuestions` to pass a useful value back to the calling code in `genQuestions`, then you need to have `answerQuestions` *return* some value, and you need `genQuestions` to *save* that return value by assigning the return value of the `answerQuestions` call to a variable, and *then* you can pass that value as the argument to `reply`.

Note that your `reply` function does absolutely nothing at all if the argument `indicator` is a value other than 1&nbsp;or&nbsp;2. It may help you to understand what is going on if you include an `else` block in that function to print out some other message (and possibly the value of `indicator`) in case `indicator` has some other value.";;
So I found that the problem is that I have been returning the value of indicator back to *genQuestions()*.;;
If a function does not return a value, it needs to be declared to return void. If you declare it to return int and then don't return a value, then the compiler will probably complain, because this often indicates that you intended it to return a value but forgot to;;
"You need to declare the types of your function parameters.

    int genQuestions(difficulty, response, RAnswers, indicator)
    {
        /* ... */
    }

What types are `difficulty`, `response`, `RAnswers`, and `indicator`? Are they `int`s? If so, you need to declare their types like this:

    int genQuestions(int difficulty, int response, int RAnswers, int indicator)
    {
        /* ... */
    }

Likewise for all your other functions.

Moving on - consider just loading up a web page, say Reddit, in your browser.  Your browser makes an HTTP GET request to a on Reddit's web server.  Reddit's web server eventually returns a bunch of HTML, which your browser then renders as a web page for you to look at.

What's the difference between that, and a web service?  Very little actually.  A web service works in a very similar way - except instead of returning HTML intended to be rendered in a browser window for a human to look at, a web service more commonly returns specially formatted plain text (often in a format like XML or JSON), intended for another application to parse.

I'm going to assume you've done some PHP programming since you apparently know enough to dislike PHP.  So consider a PHP script that just spits out XML instead of HTML - congratulations, you've just made a web service!

That's the basic idea - from there, you'd want to look into things like handling different HTTP verbs (GET vs POST are the most common, but there are others can you leverage.  A simple rule to follow is that GET web services are used for reading information out of your database, while POST web services are used to write data back to your database.)  How you setup your URL schemes to reflect the data model you are working with.  Authentication and security.  Etc.  But, in general, if you're used to doing ""traditional"" web development (in terms of HTML/CSS/JS, etc) - most of the concepts you encounter in web service development map back pretty cleanly to traditional web development concepts that you are probably already familiar with.

In terms of how to make web services - pretty much any language which can be used for traditional web development can be used for creating web services.  Many languages even have a variety of built-in and 3rd party libraries and toolkits that can be used to abstract some common patterns in web service development.  Just google your language + ""web service development"" for a plethora of frameworks, examples, tutorials and references.";;

"The cause of the implicit declaration error here is that you've used the same header guard word for all your header files. So when myfunctions.h is included, MYFUNCTIONS is defined. Then genQuestions.h includes answerQuestion.h - but because MYFUNCTIONS is already defined, the #ifndef is not evaluated - so the #include statement doesn't actually include anything, which is why it later complains about answerQuestion not being declared.

You need to use a different header guard word for every .h file - using the filename in all caps is usually fine. In addition you should not put the implementation of functions in a header file - header files are for declarations only, the implementation should go in a seperate .c file. The use of header guards prevents this problem from showing up in this case, but if you had more than one C file and they both included the same header, you would get an error due to multiple definition of the functions, since the function definition would be included into both files.";;
"Headers are for declarations **only**. That's what the difference is between a .c file and a .h file, the whole point of the different kinds of files. What you do is you put all your functions in .c files, and then you declare them in one or more .h files. Then all you have to do is to #include the right .h files when you need the declarations.

It's as if Symbolab got a bit retarded. When it applied a * (b/c) = (a*b) / c, he did - * (1/3) = (- * 1) / 3. But x * 1 = x, so - * 1 = - Therefore (- * 1)/3 = -/3. And -/3 is basically -0/3 = 0. It seems to be a problem with the exponent. It's weird though...;;

I disagree with this because Codecademy teaches you how to start coding. It's not for people who already know how to code and want to learn new syntax.

Instead of printing the palindrome when you find it you just stuff it into a var. At the end of the process when you visited all the numbers you just print the var. Since you go from low (100) to high (998) the last one will always be the largest. ;;

It's because you're storing the strings, not the numbers. And then max compares them alphabetically instead of numerically since max has no way of knowing that you want them to be compared based on number values. So just change l.append(c) to l.append(n) so it appends the number instead of the string.;;
"Your current print statement executes on every item that makes it through that 'if' statement (essentially, every item that is a palindrome).

Instead of printing each item, think about how you can collect all the palindromes into the same container so that they can be compared by length later.

Or alternatively, think about how you can check each palindrome as you receive it to see whether or not it is longer than any of the other palindromes you have recieved. This way, you don't need to store every palindrome you find; only the current ""king of the hill"", so to speak.

However, by nature, your program works from lowest to highest, therefore the last palindrome you find will be the largest one.";;

That could cause problems later on.  If you wanted to display the measures in their original form, you would have to convert back.  It's also helpful for code readers - value is the input, result is the input converted to a standard unit.;;

* Identifiers that begin with an underscore followed by a capital letter are reserved, so you can't use the name `_Instruction`.
* I really don't think you should be defining `_MSC_VER` yourself.
* Lines 53-64 of `parser.c` look suspect to me.  You're copying over all of `buf` into an array of 50 characters, and then terminating it at the first space.  Why not just copy up to the space (while checking the bounds, of course)?
* On line 67: you know the size of `ins_table`.  Why do you need a dummy member on the end to tell you when to stop?
* Sometimes you declare all variables at the beginning of the function, and sometimes you declare them in the middle.  It isn't all that big a problem, but I'd try to be more consistent.  (Is this C89 or what, by the way?)
* Lines 358-364 don't make much sense.  Why are you breaking on every iteration of the loop?

More in general:

* You've got a lot of variables called `pch` and `temp` and such.  I'd look into giving them more descriptive names.
* You seem fairly inconsistent about error checking.  In a language without exceptions, I'd be doubly wary of this.  You should indicate somehow that a piece of code still needs to have error-checking added, or that you for some reason choose to assume no errors will happen.
* You should compile with more warnings.";;
"Thank you for the response!

I am defining _MSC_VER because of MinGW. I primarily use GCC as my compiler on Windows. I used to think that MinGW did not implement a lot of Windows APIs at the time which were actually implemented, the only problem was _MSC_VER had to be defined to a higher version. I guess I just made it a habit, even though I use no Windows specific API and try to be as portable in most of my code.

Lines 53-64 of **parser.c** I can explain. Basically, x86 assembly has a limit on how big an instruction it can be, ASCII wise the instruction can be pretty long I suppose, but I figured 50 bytes would be enough for the longest possible instruction which can be written in ASCII. If not, the limit could always be increased.

Line 67. When I was writing this I had taken a different approach, it was only then that I learned how to implement the same thing with a statically initialized struct. And I will be frank, that for loop, I still am not quite sure how it works. Because you are incrementing a pointer byte by byte, or so I am led to believe. At some point any byte not 0ULL should match pins_table->ins. So I must definitely read up on this.

I always code in C99, the code is therefore less strict about some things(defining a variable within a for loop). I make use of automatic variables, i.e they get created and destroyed on each iteration, that is simply how I've gotten used to declare them, perhaps bad practice.

Lines 358-364 - I break because each comma separates instructions(or operands in an instruction), once I've processed one, I must go to the next.";;
"> I used to think that MinGW did not implement a lot of Windows APIs at the time which were actually implemented, the only problem was _MSC_VER had to be defined to a higher version.

The point of `_MSC_VER` is so that your program can tell what version of MSVC++ you're compiling with.  If you're not compiling with MSVC++, it shouldn't be defined at all. If you do need to define it `undef` it ASAP, or you can screw up other libraries.

> I figured 50 bytes would be enough for the longest possible instruction which can be written in ASCII.

In that case, you need to validate that it's a valid instruction before you copy it over.  It's input provided by the user; when it comes to this, you should assume the user is malicious.

> I still am not quite sure how it works.

Basically, you go through the `instruction_table`s until you hit one that's got a zero as its `ins`, and you've specified beforehand that that means that it means ""there are no more valid `instruction_table`s"".

> perhaps bad practice.

It isn't bad practice by itself, but you need to be consistent.  If you're willing to make use of this, why are you defining `pch` so early in `INS_parse`?  (Personally, I prefer giving everything as small a scope as possible.)

         // stuff without break or continue

Is CelShaderPlugin a project that you created?  It looks like you aren't linking the lib where all that stuff is defined.;;
"Can you give an example? I've included all the right header files, or so I believe, and added an include path to the project.

CelShaderPlugin is the project, CelShaderVolume extends PostProcessVolume. I've included the header file for PostProcessVolume, should that be enough?

One of my main questions is around inheritance. Say we have Classes A, B and C that all inherit from each other.

Do I need to include any headers for Class C to use methods in Class A if Class B already did that? If Class B doesn't declare or implement something (say both A and B are abstract), can C see the virtual methods from Class A?";;
"No, including header files is not sufficient to satisfy the linker. You've told the compiler that those functions exist but that doesn't pull in their definition.

For a normal VS project, you do this by right-clicking on the project, go to ""properties"" and then linker -> input -> additional dependencies.  You need to know the name of the .lib file that contains all the UE code.  I'm not sure if UE4 has some special setup but it should be covered in their documentation.

If class B inherits from class A it does not need to reimplement any functions that are defined in class A.  You're probably running into these issues for the same reason as above - the actual code for class A's functions is in a .lib file somewhere that you need to tell the linker about.

Another possibility is that you're expected to add all the UE4 .cpp files to your own project. That would be unusual.  But again, this should be covered in their docs.

"R is a programming language that is used for a variety of purposes, with working with statistics and mathematics probably being some of the more popular uses of the language. R and its libraries provide a great amount of functionality, including the ability to create graphs and other graphics, perform a variety of mathematical functions, and much, much more. There are also third-party libraries that can be downloaded and used, for a variety of purposes, as well. 

Here's a [link to the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language) on the R programming language, where you learn more about it and its uses.

If you're going to learn R, you will have to download the R programming langauge, which you can do from the official [R Project website](http://www.r-project.org/). Additionally, you may be interested in downloading and using an IDE for writing R code, with one option being [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/), which can be downloaded and used for free.

Regarding tutorials and other resources for learning R, you can probably find a variety of R tutorials online, in both text and video-based format, with some tutorials listed below.

http://www.r-tutor.com/

http://ww2.coastal.edu/kingw/statistics/R-tutorials/

Having been required to learn a little bit about R for a class I took on Big Data, I can tell you that it is pretty powerful when it comes to performing statistical and mathematical functions, as well as for generating graphs and other representations of data and what not. However, the syntax of the language kind of differs from languages like Java, Python, etc., though I'm sure you could get the hang of it pretty quickly with some practice.

Thanks. I'll check the links out.;;
How do you want to compare them? Can you give an example?;;
"I have an array of numbers (transitions) and a string. I want to see if a character in the string is equal to any of the numbers so I have:

            for(int i = 0; i < transtions.length; i++) {
               if(transtions[i] == string.charAt(0))
                  return true;
            }";;
"Gotcha.

Each character is assigned a unique ASCII or Unicode number. For example - in ASCII - [the char 'A' corresponds to the decimal number 65 and the char '0' corresponds to decimal 48](http://www.asciitable.com/). So you do not want to do this:

     if(transtions[i] == string.charAt(0)) /* This compares the

                                    integer the char represents*/

In Java, you can compare a char and int the way you describe in a couple of ways:

You can use the Java Character class and use the getNumericValue() function like so:
    
    if(transtions[i] == Character.getNumericValue(string.charAt(0)))

or you can do it the old fashioned way and add the ASCII value of '0' to your character. This addition will return the actual integer representation of your character:

    if(transtions[i] == (string.charAt(0) + '0')

All of that makes sense?";;

That works but it's really inefficient. Chars are just integers with ascii representations of the number so you can simply cast a char to int and substract 48 to get the integer value of the char. ;;

    greater than the size of obj2

There're probably better ways to do this, but this is the simplest, at least for me, to do it.";;
if the array is sorted you probably only need 1 loop if it is not sorted you need 2 loops. Then compare the elements and if the elements are the same, you do nothing otherwise you save it in another array. in the end you return the array/vector, and you are done.;;
"The (terse) definition of a string is an array of characters. You should be able to just exchange each char[] for a string type. That make sense?

Thank you again! I think I have everything worked out now except for the if else block which sets the checksum to the proper value at line 91.

(sum % 10) is the remainder you get when dividing by 10.

* You said you already know some Java. I suggest continuing to work with. Refresh your knowledge of the language.
* Learn about the BSD sockets API and some basic aspects of networking. Understand what TCP and UDP are, and what TCP gets you (it's quite a bit). Resources often show C code, but you are mostly focused on the concepts.
* Pick an API or library for your programming language that allows you to handle networking concerns. For example, the OS provided BSD sockets API for C, Boost Asio for C++, nio for Java, etc.
* Work your way up to a point where you can have a client and server application communicate text messages with each other. That means the clients can open and sustain a connection properly, read and send efficently, and shutdown gracefully.

If you get up to this point, and still don't know how to further proceeed, ask your question again.";;

Line 4: you got it

Line 5: It's not printing false (yet). It's setting is_prime to false. The way this loop works is that it runs the inside of the loop with i=2.  Then it does it again with i=3.  It keeps doing this until i=n-1. So every time the loop runs, i is a different integer.

Line 7: first ""end"" closes the if statement inside the for loop.  Second ""end"" closes the for loop.  Third ""end"" closes the if/else construction. Fourth ""end"" closes the method definition.

Line 9: is_prime has only one value. That value can change. It started off by assuming it was true, but the program might have changed the value of is_prime after the loop proved that n is composite.";;
">line 3: ""is_prime = true"" A variable that results in a boolean value of true...um ok. Cool. Not sure what it's purpose is within the code block of this method... but I'm sure it has something to do with the ""for loop"" (obviously) below it (line 4), and the ""if statement"" on line 9. 

The booleans are evaluated on line 9, and indirectly on line 11. If the boolean value is true, they print something. If it's false, they print something else.

>line 4: ""for i in 2..n-1"" for integers between 2 and argument value minus 1 do this (or run code below on line 5). I'm pretty sure this is what this is saying but could be wrong so I included. 

You are correct.

>line 5: ""if n % i == 0"" If argument modulo...argument equals 0 print false? This is another confusing & frustrating line because I'm not sure what the ""i"" is supposed to represent or be a place holder for in this case. The ""2"" from line 4? The argument value? The argument value minus 1? One of the numbers between 2 and the argument? All of the numbers between 2 and the argument being compared against the argument?

The i is short for ""index"", which is sort-of a placeholder. In the for loop, the i is evaluated in line 5. Each time you hit the ""end"" on line 6, the ""i"" value goes up. It keeps going up and keeps getting evaluated each time until you hit your end condition, which in this case is ""2..**n-1**""

>line 7: ""end"" The only end I'm sure about here is the one at the end closing the method as a whole. I have no idea why there are 3 others. 1 to end the code block within the method sure but 3...um what? Is this some type of nesting? A method within a method? It seems like the latter half of the method that starts on line 9 is a new code block. Why the separation within the same method?

In ruby, each time you use an if statement or for loop, you must signify when it ends. The end on line 7 signifies the end of the if statement (line 5). The end on line 8 signifies the end of the for loop (line 4)

>line 9: ""if is_prime"" Equates to either true or false par lines 3 and 6 from earlier. Confusion abound. 

If is_prime is true, the code goes along to line 10. If it's not true, the if statement fails, and it proceeds to the else on line 11.

Good quote.  Never heard it before but it makes a ton of sense.;;
A sorted list is still a list type. And as far I can see from the [code](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Objects/listobject.c#L402-412), it's always a linear search. So a sorted list still incurs O(n) cost.;;
'in' calls \_\_contains__ and for lists it's O(n), the list doesn't know it's sorted. if you want you can use bisect module to do binary search and insertion on sorted lists. if you don't need the properties of a list you can just use a set instead which is O(1) for lookup.;;
"> Does the ""in"" keyword benefit from a speed boost due to the list being sorted?

No.  It doesn't know that your list is sorted, and always performs a O(n) linear search regardless of the contents.  You can use functions from the `bisect` module to perform a binary search, but don't.

> is there a better version for checking for membership in a sorted list than ""in""?

Don't use a list, use a set.  Sets have O(1) membership testing.

Edit: in response to your edit: Sorting a list is O(n log n), binary search is O(log n).  Adding to a set is O(1), lookups/membership testing is O(1).  For large amounts of data it's not even close.   Here's 10 million items:

    >>> import random

    >>> %timeit bisect.bisect_left(data, item)

So think of it this way. the class is the blueprints of an object it knows how to build an object but isn't the object its self.

I'm not too familiar with Python. But in every language Ive worked with you can use self to reference variables that are instanced and can't be accessed by other things. Are you familiar with any other language I could try and write a simple example for you and explain it to you.;;

So think of it this way with this I have a person class which is a general thing and I can make a new person named GoodLittleMine with a height of 65.0 the class is the concept where the object is specific and holds data.

"This is something you should be able to do with nearly any programming language. No particular language is going to be uniquely suited for this task.

However, if you're a beginner + have not yet picked a language, a good language to start with might be Python -- it has a relatively low learning curve + is commonly used as a teaching language, so you're likely to find tons of good resources for it -- see the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq) for more info.";;

That said, the problem seems reasonably attainable to me. You're probably going to run through a tutorial first to pick up the basics of whatever language you chose before you can fully tackle the problem, but that won't necessarily take a long time. 

Once you begin writing your program, you may find that the solution isn't immediately obvious, though you should be able to solve it with some researching and careful thinking. (Your problem description is basically a slight twist on a classical CS algorithm, and so is definitely solvable.)";;

This is probably too big of a hint, but check out [sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets).;;
"There is a rather efficient way to do that:

Sorted probably uses a quicksort. quicksort scales mostly with O(n*log(n)) the additional linear comparison doesn't matter.";;
"You can do this on average in linear time (O(n)) using a dictionary (not intuitive but the fastest possible time complexity). The operations [""Get Item"" and ""Set Item"" are both on average constant (O(1)) time](https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity) for a dictionary. 

That means for each number in the list you can use it as the key to index the dictionary. If the get item succeeds that means the number is already a key, and thus we have a duplicate. If it fails we do a set item with the number as the key. Essentially the set item says ""this is the first time I've seen this number"" and the get item says ""I've seen this number before"".

Code is short and sweet:

    class Solution:
        # @param {integer[]} nums
        # @return {boolean}
        def containsDuplicate(self, nums):
            d = {}
            for n in nums:
                try:
                    d[n] += 1
                    return True
                except:
                    d[n] = 1
        
            return False";;
Partial application allows you to bind some arguments of the function and create a new function with those bindings (this is related although different than currying). This is incredibly useful from the perspective of code reuse, for example. Your example is not very complex, but imagine you needed to make a makeTriple, etc function as well.;;
you're mostly taking about the partial application aspect of currying, there is no advantage in terms of abstraction it's just far easier to write.;;
"Posting a link to an executable is useless. Post code.

With that said, we don't need to see code for this. Basically, you want to figure out what variables need to be saved and later restored for the game to work. Once you've identified which those are, you'll need to figure out how to save that data to a database. It's noteworthy that a database is a little unusual for a game save. A good starting point for a game save would be to directly serialize data or use a format like JSON. A dictionary is often the data structure of choice for simple save files.

There's a lot of room for optimizing the save format, but that's unnecessary for such a simple game.

Anyway, when you save, you'll ""simply"" write all the variables that you previously identified to this file (eg, by adding them to a dictionary and serializing the dictionary). The hardest part is likely getting all the data you need into the save functionality (since this data is likely spread around the program).

Loading is the reverse. Deserialize the file and set the appropriate variables to the values from the dictionary (again, you need some way to access the places where the variables will be set). You then must figure out where to start the game. Eg, a simple platformer might simply load the level that the player should be on (a more complex save system might place the player at a specific position, etc).";;

Get a char array of your string, then add the shiftValue to each of your characters, then create a new string from your array.;;
"On line 11, you can just keep String codedText; you can omit ="".
I know in C you can treat chars as integers, so doing something like char a = 'a'+1 will resuly in b. Note that it follows the ASCII table. I'm not sure if you can do the same in Java, I never tried, but I think you can.
I'd suggest breaking down the string in a char array and shifting them one by one. You'll have to handle chars whose ASCII value is ('a' value)+(shift value)>26, so you'll have to start again from 'a' instead of keep going forward.";;
In Java it's essentially the same, only that the `char` datatype commonly represents a Unicode data point.;;

Double check how you're passing the variables to your tempAndSpeed function. ;;
"As soon as you said that, I realized my error. Thanks!

It is still giving me the same error for windchill though, I am trying to figure it out :/";;
"In C++, all variables are passed *by value*. That means that when you pass a variable into a function, the variable is copied. Any changes you make inside the function affect the copy, not the original variable.

Therefore, your tempAndSpeed function does not actually alter the variables in your main() function; only the local copy which is discarded when the function returns. Therefore the variables windSpeed and temp are uninitialized.

If you want the tempAndSpeed function to initialize those variables, you have to pass a *pointer* to those variables, rather than just their values. You can then modify the values of the variables in the main() function through the pointer.";;
"oooooh. I actually had it tempAndSpeed(double& windSpeed, double& temp)

I changed it, and I should not have doubted myself. 

I understand those errors now, but it's still saying that my windchill variable has not been initialized. ";;
"In the windchillFactor() function, you pass windchill in by value, but do not use it - again, you probably meant to pass a pointer.

However, you also return the calculated windchill factor from the function, so there's no need to be passing it in as an argument - I would just remove it from the argument list altogether, and that should work.";;
"Okay, I see now. I moved it to be only a declared variable inside the function, and my code works!

Thank you so much for your help.";;
Have you heard of references?;;
Oops, forgot this was C++ and not plain C ... they're basically the same thing internally though.;;
"> they're basically the same thing internally though

Nope.";;
Aren't they? So how are references implemented? I thought they were basically pointers with some additional restrictions imposed by the compiler - I didn't realize they'd generate different machine code.;;
How something is implemented is irrelevant.  References and pointers at the language level are quite different.;;
As I understand it, references don't need to be explicitly dereferenced, can't be null, and can't be altered once created. But I would have thought that in the final compiled code, you'd get the same thing, though I guess the extra information might allow the compiler to make some additional optimizations that it couldn't have made otherwise? I don't really know that much about the implementation of C++ though, so I could be completely wrong.;;
"Consider:

    int x;
    int &rx = x;

This does not declare two variables.  It declares one variable with two names.  It does not declare an int plus some kind of pointer that's automatically dereferenced.  A pointer that's automatically dereferenced would be a second variable, because it would have to store an address.  A reference doesn't do that.  It's an alias for another variable.  In *some* cases, yes, such as passing parameters to a function, the under-the-covers implementation acts similar to a pointer that's automatically dereferenced if you squint hard.  But references aren't just used for passing parameters.

Among the other differences, references have different rules for type deduction contexts.  And a reference can bind to an rvalue, but a pointer can't, as you can't take the address of an rvalue.  And so on.
";;
OK, thanks for the explanation. I didn't consider the case where the reference isn't being passed anywhere - I can see why that would not require indirection to implement, since the reference can't be altered like a pointer. As I said, I'm not too knowledgeable about C++ - I prefer plain C myself.;;

Yeah, after thinking more about the actual problem and actually trying to code it, I've seen that a dictionary would prove more useful because if I use a list it looks like I'll have to do a lot of iteration as the problem states that the test input file will provide some random names and I'll have to give money to those names. But all part of the learning process. I wouldn't really understand the advantage of certain data structures without doing these problems.;;
Exactly. The effect is the same but a dictionary is much more convenient and makes more sense here. Once you decide on that the rest is a little math trickery and managing reading lines.;;

To hire someone to create this would be quite expensive. The issue is that skilled programmers are not cheap and freelancers have a higher hourly rate. There's no way to say for sure how much it would cost since I don't know how large this is, but it could easily be several thousand dollars. Most likely a relatively simple quiz done entirely client side (if you don't need to save results or anything) could be a couple hundred.

You could possibly save some money by having a student write the code. It's riskier, though, since code quality may suffer and there could be serious bugs (although this is really a problem no matter what). Could even be very affordable if you use one of those Indian programmers on a freelance site. Some of the prices they charge are almost too good to be true (which also makes it risky).

Point being that the cost can vary wildly (especially depending on exactly what you want done) and the cheapest choices are very risky. Programmers don't have the same standards as you might expect from a mechanic or something.

"There are no callbacks in HTTP. A callback usually means that you pass a reference to a receiver that the receiver can call whenever it wants to (some time in the future and/or multiple times). Since HTTP is strictly client-calls-server callbacks doesn't make sense.

 ";;
"That's rather vague, can you be more specific?  HTTP is a network protocol, and doesn't have anything to do with callbacks, which is something that happens in a programming language.  But there are lots of circumstances where callbacks are used in web applications.

For example, in JavaScript executing on a browser, the author might want something to happen when a certain element is clicked, so they'd install an event listener for the 'click' event of that element.  This is done by calling a browser interface like `elem.addEventListener` which takes as parameters the name or type of event and a reference to a function to be installed as the listener.  That function is usually written by the author to perform whatever action they want performed when the event occurs.  The browser stores a reference to that function, and when the event occurs, it calls that function.  The function is called a callback because the user is not calling the function, but asking the browser to call it at some unknown point in the future.

Another example is JSONP.  JSONP is a way of getting around the same-origin policy of the browser.  Its based on the observation that scripts can be hosted anywhere, so one way of accessing a cross-origin resource (which would ordinarily be forbidden) is to make it into the form of a remotely hosted script which is executed.  (Yes, this is horribly insecure.)  The goal is to pass some data (encoded in JSON), so this script really doesn't have any behavior, it's just a chunk of data.  But it still needs to be in the form of a script, so it's formatted as a call to some user function.  The assumption is that a user has already written a function with that name, so by loading and executing that remote script, that function will be called with the desired JSON data.  So this is another form of a callback.  Often the name of that user-provided function is made into a parameter of the request as part of the query string.  This is necessary since there might be multiple scripts running that all want to use JSONP, so the name of the callback function has to be configurable.  It will often be named `callback`, so if you see some HTTP request for a JSONP asset that has `callback` as part of its query parameters, that's what's happening.

But again, who knows.  The idea of a callback is very common and used in many different contexts, so it's impossible to know which one you're asking about.
";;
"HTTP requests are initiated by the client and sent to the server; however, there is a concept of ""long-lived"" HTTP connections.  This basically means ""I'll call you now, and you get back to me when you have new information"".  After one cycle of that, the client typically re-initiates a new long-lived call immediately so there is a consistent pipe with which the server may push new information to the client.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_technology

"Don't think callbacks and http are mentioned together alot, but I can imagine passing a URL to an external service which then will call you back.

It isn't as easy as java (IMO) but it look better if you use the native windowing of the platform.

So now my opinions ...

You don't want to use Qt (as I said, I'd guess very little use) or AWT (very old).  Swing will get the job done but doesn't integrate well in a lot of cases.  There's another option called SWT but I believe it's harder (and probably still not perfect).

My suggestion would be to go with Swing or the newer JavaFX (as /u/hobackpack suggests).";;

>I've heard that major companies use Qt sometimes, but as a student just trying to do some test programs that aren't anything large scale, is this the best option for me?

Qt is meant mostly for C++. But you could use it in Java with a wrapper. [Qt Jambi](http://qtjambi.org/) is one. I've never used it and cannot say how good it is. And C++ is a more difficult language with more ""gotchas"" and places to fuck up, so no, it's probably not the best option for you.

>Is the gui side [of C++] easy to jump into/better to use to develop than with Java?

lol, no

Seriously, though, unless you need C++ for some other reason (main reason to use C++ would be performance), don't use it. It'll usually make things more complex and you'll often have to write more code than some other languages. Java's pretty verbose, so it won't result in less code written, but some other languages (eg, Scala, Python, etc) can reduce the amount of code needed.";;
You should take both, the order doesn't matter.;;
I recommend doing data structures and algorithms before OOP. ;;
Well data structures is going to be useful no matter the programming language. Learning about worst-case time complexity is going to transcend whether you are programming in C, Java, Python, or Perl. I had 1 semester of Java before I took assembly programming and data structures, and when I finally took higher level Java (OOP) programming courses, I was more prepared when it came to efficiency. And thats not to say that taking data structures first, isn't going to teach you OOP because C++ is a OOP language. ;;
Thanks, mate. I am going with data structures then .;;
They're both very fundamental classes. The order doesn't really matter, pick whichever has a better professor at the time or something. If your OOP class requires lots of prior knowledge in data structures, take the data structures class first for a better start in OOP class.;;

In general, don't worry too much about the code quality of a repository as a factor in whether you should delete it. Anyone who looks at it and is able to evaluate code quality will also see that the repository was last touched a long time ago, so it's not a big deal.

You can certainly delete it if you want. But the benefits of doing so are pretty close to nil in almost all cases (unless you're, say, building something for illegal or ethically questionable purposes, in which case you might see a large benefit there). It's probably easiest to keep it around and not worry about it, especially if there's even a tiny chance that you might return to it for some reason.";;
I say if you ever linked to it from another website, don't delete it. Say you're having a conversation with someone about your repository and you reference it, someone else who views your conversation may want to see the repository for context.;;

> I need to use an insert statement to assign a column in the database

When you `INSERT` into a database, you are adding a row to a table.  If you aren't familiar with databases, you can think of a table as an Excel sheet where the first row is headers.  Here's an example.

Id|Questions|Answers
:--|:--|:--
1|What is your favorite color?|Orange.
2|Cats or dogs?|Foxes.

The two rows with Id 1 and 2 were both `INSERT`ed into the table.  You are not ""assigning"" anything to a column.

> assign a column in the database to html

HTML is just text, so it can be stored in a database just like any other series of words can be.

> Its getting the value of e to be the html I want.

So this question really has nothing to do with SQL.  Try not to share unnecessary information when asking questions, it will lead to quicker and better responses.  Just a tip for future question asking.

> Should I put the html in an html file and read it in from that or something?

You can build HTML just like you would build any other string.  However, we can't help you create an HTML document without knowing what the contents of it are supposed to be.";;
I've got the html document completed on my pc, I don't think I'm allowed to share it on the internet however. Knowing its just like any other string does make it a bit easier to think about though so thanks.;;
Your post led me to believe you were going to have to programmatically build the HTML.  If you are just inserting the contents of a document, all you have to do is open it up and read it as a string.  Then you can insert that string into your database.;;

"1) The type you're looking for is ""uint8_t""

2) The error message is telling you exactly what's wrong - you are trying to assign an integer to a pointer. There are very few situations in which you would want to do that, so you need to use an explicit cast if that is actually what you want to do. 

Here, though, you don't want to make myWriteBuffer point to 0b1110000, you want to write the value 0b1110000 into (presumably the first element of) myWriteBuffer. You can either use an array initializer:

    uint8_t myWriteBuffer[8]={0b1110000,0,0,0,0,0,0,0}

or you can use memset to initialize the array to all zeroes, and then initialize the first element seperately:

    uint8_t myWriteBuffer[8];
    memset(myWriteBuffer,0,8);
    myWriteBuffer[0]=0b1110000;";;

Pot doesn't have much effect on your *long* term memory so it doesn't have a negative impact on your learnt ability to code.  What it does do is devastate your short term memory (this is fully supported by studies). 

You will misname variables, fail to re-use, refer to API docs more frequently and most importantly; forget what you were doing later on.

Making `array` static does nothing for the memeory that `array` points to. That is memory on the heap dynamically allocated using new; that will be good memory until you `delete` it (which you are not doing now, btw; you should always free any memory you allocate). Making `array` static will make the memory _for the pointer_ (that is, the address itself) persist in memory.

This is something you'd usually write by hand, assuming that you wanted a public facing website. It would require some knowledge of basic SQL and any server side language. There's also a number of types of DBMSes (which is what Access is), although for such a basic use, it wouldn't matter too much. I recommend Postgres if you have no other idea about what to use. Postgres also has a pretty simple full text search capability built in, if your search functionality would need that (it would if you want to search for things like articles or reddit posts).

And then you can use any plain text editor you want. Sublime Text, Notepad++, Brackets, and Atom are some examples. Or vim if you're a masochist.

But if you just want an admin interface to visually see the database, then there's a number of tools for this, all DBMS specific. For example, Postgres has [pgAdmin](http://www.pgadmin.org/).

"I've had similar issues with Odin project, and Rails in general. It so frustrating to be using a different version of the tools in an explanation and having to spend hours trying to find workarounds that don't break the rest of your code.

While giving web dev a try, I did find myself really liking javascript, jQuery, node.js, etc. So I'm working on that in my free time with [freecodecamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/) (I think I may have come to FCC via a link in one of your previous posts!). They claim to teach you full stack Javascript. I just started it this week, so I don't know how true that is, but I'm liking it so far.

Where I feel Odin might kind of throw you to the wolves and tell you to do a bunch of problems, courses etc., with FCC you do one thing at a time and it won't tell you exactly what you need to do, but will give you helpful links to relevant documentation.";;
i will have to test this out! Thanks;;
"I'd like to recommend giving the Odin project another try. It's less hand-holding, sure, but scraping by when there's minimal help for what you're trying to do is a necessary skill. It's perfectly alright to be feeling stumped. In fact, if you're not feeling stumped from time to time, you're probably not challenging yourself. If a particular assignment takes all day, that doesn't necessarily mean you're doing something wrong.

Keep at it. Try looking for related resources to see if anything clicks. Ask for help (but only after investing time into trying to figure it out for yourself). Try figuring the problem out on paper. Try experimenting with some new things to see if anything does what you need. Try and break the problem down into smaller parts (this is quite crucial for software dev).

The reason for this is that the more challenging and less guided environment of the Odin Project better prepares you for making a real piece of software (something Codecademy hilariously fails at). You need to be able to build up the ability to use google to find resources. You need to get into the mindset of solving problems for yourself.

If bugs are causing an issue for you, make sure you have learned how to use a debugger (something beginners often seem to skip over -- huge mistake).

As an aside, I noticed that the code in your other questions is poorly indented. You should really fix that. I have no idea how the hell you even manage to work with that code. Poor indentation makes the code almost unreadable and readability is important. You really need to be indenting consistently. In fact, I'm gonna repeat myself in bold because you're just shooting yourself in the foot here for no reason: **indent your code consistently**. It does matter. Bad indentation is just going to cause bugs and make it harder to read your code (and you should be reading your code when things don't work as expected).";;
I understand the logic behind your response for sure. Two things: would you recommend running along side odin with something like pluralsight as a visual companion? and B. Can you give me an exact example of code improperly indented and then after that possibly suggest a website / resource for me to possibly learn how to indent properly.;;
">would you recommend running along side odin with something like pluralsight as a visual companion?

You could. I would think it's unnecessary and perhaps too much at once, but if you find it helpful, go ahead.

>Can you give me an exact example of code improperly indented 

Note there's a [few different indentation styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style) (K&R and Allman are the only ones used, usually). And then you'd want to indent whenever you have a new block (simplified, you want to indent whenever you have something inside braces). You'd usually indent wrapped lines as well (often twice -- just be consistent).

For an example, [here's a well indented file](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/offset.js) in K&R style and [here's an example](https://github.com/MikeHoffert/fbms/blob/master/main/src/cmpt370/fbms/FileChangeHandlers.java) in Allman style.

There's no site I know of that teaches how to indent since it's something that's usually pretty obvious once you see it and it can be picked up from example code (I suspect most resources assume that you'd pick up the indentation from sample code).";;

In that case it's different! I still recommend C programming a modern approach, some parts of it are really enlightening.

"Eh, I guess it's doable, but depends on what kind of C++ you know. Some people know ""C with classes"" and think it's C++. If that's the case, you can probably pick up C quickly. If you know high level C++ (""modern C++""), then there's a bit more to learn.

I'd say pick up a copy of K&R. The early chapters can be easily skimmed through. But mostly you'll want to try and implement basic stuff in C to work on your skill and naturally encounter problems. A good such project that can be done in a few hours (or a few days if you know no C) would be a linked list.

"Hi, thanks for the reply. 
I have written both types of C++ if im honest, I wrote code for the ps3 which was very close to C and I wrote code for the RPi and pandaboard embedded systems which was also pretty close to C I guess. 

A linked list is actually quite a fantastic idea, i have written one in java before so it should not be too difficult and im sure there will be valuable lessons to learn.

"Any particularly non-trivial C? You're not doing it. Not with any real understanding or comfort, anyway. If you know C++ you can largely get by writing any reasonably simple C program with reference material but, say, if they want an example of a threaded C program with shared memory segments and some direct interfacing with the Win32/Linux API there's just not enough time in an interview to figure that stuff out to the point you can confidently answer questions or do a demonstration.

If they want you for a junior position or are expecting you to need time on the job to get into C then good C++ experience should be enough, at least in theory, to get the job. If they want you to know it from day 1, though, I think it's a bit of a lost cause.

**If I had to choose things for you to cram on:** ... I can't tell you. What's the job?

I have done low level and high level C++ and I have around 4 years of C++ experience. I think I could write simple C programs without tooooooo much difficulty, wrote a few real simple ones earlier today.

Take `float sum=0;` out of the loop. Right now every iteration sets sum to 0. ;
Also: `counter` doesn't count, `a` does (from 0 upwards, so be careful).;;

"Yes, but it seems you want to average the values `net[0]`, `net[1]`, ..., `net[counter-1]`, but (with /u/romple's correction) it actually averages `net[counter]`, `net[counter]`, ..., `net[counter]` (`counter` times), which is pretty much meaningless.

You probably want to use `net[a]` instead of `net[counter]`.

~~Also, I noticed you declared~~

~~const int SIZE = 100;~~

~~and used it for your array sizes. In C++ this only works, if your compiler supports so called variable-length-arrays (VLAs) and you shouldn't assume that, because it is a non-standard feature. (In C this would work only in standards C99 or newer). Instead you should use~~

~~#define SIZE 100~~

">  In C++ this only works, if your compiler supports so called variable-length-arrays (VLAs)

This isn't so. This is perfectly good Standard C++:

        const int SIZE = 100;
        int a[SIZE];

as the value of SIZE is known at compile time.";;

"> Are you absolutely sure?

Yes.

>  This says otherwise

The value of the variable is not known at compile time in that case.

> but maybe they added it in recent standards

No, it's always been like that - good C++ practice has always discouraged the use of #define, replacing it with compile-time const objects.

";;
"I looked it up and you are right.

On one hand, arrays do require a constant-expression, but `const` variables which are initialized with a constant-expression (in this case a literal) become constant-expressions.

Here's the relevant snipets out the standard:

§8.1 (in C++14 standard draft n4140) declaration of arrays:

    noptr-abstract-declarator:
    ...
        noptr-abstract-declarator_opt[constant-expression_opt] attribute-specifier-seq_opt
    ...

§5.19

A **conditional-expression** e is a core constant expression **unless** the evaluation of e, following the rules of the abstract machine (1.9), would evaluate one of the following expressions:

* (...)

* an lvalue-to-rvalue conversion (4.1) **unless** it is applied to (2.7.1) — a non-volatile glvalue of integral or enumeration type that refers to a non-volatile const object with a preceding initialization, initialized with a constant expression.

Really hard to read, but this is exactly the reason why a const int in this case really is a constant-expression.";;
To elaborate slightly on /u/exoticmatter's response, the difference is that a mere const like that in your link is not known at compile time. With a literal, such as `const int size = 100`, we know the value at compile time and it can be substituted directly where needed (for most cases -- you obviously need a real variable if you try and take `size`'s address).;;
"Yes, the reasons why a compiler could or could not ""substitute"" constant-expressions are quite obvious. But this isn't about compilers, but about language standards.

My initial disbelief stems from the fact, that C handles this differently. In C, a variable is never a constant-expression(*), even when it is `const` and `static` (or global) and initialized with an integer-constant-expression (e.g. 5 or 4+1).

In C99 VLAs were introduced, which allowed declarations like `int array[size];` for non-constant-expressions `size`, but in general a constant-expression array-declarations and `malloc()` calls are still preferred for backwards-compatibility (and because of implementation issues of VLAs).

You could say I studied the C standard, and the more time goes by, the longer the list of small but sometimes important differences between the C and C++ standard becomes - things like existence of VLAs (which you have in C and not in C++), implicitely converted `void *` pointers, the differing type of `'a'`(`int` in C, `char` in C++) are just the start.

Saying ""C is a subset of C++"" really isn't true, and I should have know better than to suggest using `#define` in C++.

(*): Except there is the clause ""An implementation may accept other forms of constant expressions.""; but if you for example force gcc to use the C89/C90 standard, it won't pick up on it.

"About your current code:

You need to initialize your `sum` variable:

"Ok, I took another look at your code.

I thought `counter` is the number of elements in your array, but you use it as an index, so it starts out at 0, but the number of elements in your arrays is practically 1.

Therefore your average code should look like this:

    float sum = 0;
    for (int a = 0; a < counter+1; a++) {
       sum += net[a];

    ravg[counter] = sum / (counter+1);";;

C++ doesn't support this feature because it doesn't need to. We have std::vector<>, and it's enough (and actually, it's even more powerful).

"I wonder if converting the code into an [AST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) would help.  It seems like it would have a number of advantages:

1) Throws away any whitespace and comments.  
2) Makes it easier to match up identifiers that have been renamed (or you can even just ignore identifiers altogether to make the comparison easier).  
3) Ditto with numeric constants (which I wouldn't have thought about until seeing the rounding change in the sample you gave)  
4) Best of all: Since CodeAbbey supports a number of languages, this approach would reduce the language-specific code to just the parsers (which you can always borrow from other projects).

And the disadvantages:

1) Since you're comparing a data structure instead of plain text, you're probably going to have to cook up your own tools.  No simple 'diff' to make life easier.  
2) Similarly, displaying the comparison results will take a bit more work.  If you just dump the contents of the AST via a tree traversal, you're going to get something that's ugly and headache-inducing.  
3) It would be easily fooled by reordering statements that lack dependencies, unless you wanted to get clever with your comparison.  
4) Some of the information that gets discarded by creating the AST (whitespace, etc.) may actually be useful in finding similar programs, particularly if someone's only manipulating a small portion of the whitespace by hand, leaving the rest of the whitespace as a sort of fingerprint of the original code.

Also, thanks for running CodeAbbey.  I've only briefly checked it out, but it fills a great need for a general programming challenge site.  While I also like both Project Euler and CodingBat, the former is way too mathy for general programming interests, and the latter focuses on tiny subsets of programming.

Why is there no link to a github repo for a project?;;

I noticed that the tags aren't really being used by the initial posters in a useful way.

The biggest issue, though, is that the style of C++ has changed significantly even over the past ten years, let alone over the almost twenty that the OP is talking about.  Idiomatically, the book is going to be completely outdated.

K&R is still relevant for C, because the essentials of C haven't changed.";;
It looks like you aren't using a window manager and just painting yourself, right?  If that's the case then you need to listen for window resizing and repaint your canvas.;;
there is already a redraw everytime i resize the window.;;
You need to use Invalidate() instead of redraw.;;
(I think he even needs both, but definitely invalidate() to trigger recalculation of the involved Swing objects, e.g. to make them change size and location.);;
"Let's look at what actually happens in the video.

* The program starts, and is brought to the foreground. The grid is here rendered correctly.
* You resize the window to a larger size, revealing a lot of black.
* You resize the window to a size smaller than the original, hiding a lot of the hex grid.
* You return the window to approximately the original size, at which point the previously obscured part of your hex grid has been replaced with black.

Now, at this point, there are a few likely suspects that spring to mind. 
The first, and simplest, explanation is that the background-color for your JFrame is set to black, 
and your rendering code is not running for some reason. If this is the case, 
you should make sure that your component's rendering is called when a repainting of the component is requested.

The second likely scenario is that your rendering does in fact run, 
but you've forgotten a detail or two. Let's make a mental note that 
the grid, like the appearing background, is black.

If the JFrame has a black background color, and your component is 
transparent, redrawing the grid by itself will draw with black on black, 
and the end result will be as if it was never drawn. If your rendering is 
slightly more clever, only redrawing the necessary areas, but not from a 
buffer, you may be forgetting to redraw the white background, or forgetting 
to set the color to white before drawing it.

If you were redrawing with background every time, and you forgot to set the color to white
before drawing the background, you would see the entire area turn black on first resize.

Edit: It would be helpful if you had posted the source code responsible for rendering.";;

"You have to design the protocol.  The network is no different from a file on your harddisk.  It's just a place to send bytes. If you were to open a file, you have to know how to read the bytes of that file and interpret it, same over the network.  You need a protocol to delineate all the pieces you want to know about.  For instance you could:

    file size [4 bytes]
    file name string [size bytes]
    file length [4 bytes]
    file data [size bytes]

then on the other end you'd be able to read that back as:

    read size
    allocate room for file name
    read N bytes, and interpret that as the file name
    read size
    open the file for writing
    read N bytes, and write them to the file.


Or you could look into a well-understood file transfer protocol like FTP, or HTTP.  Both of these would allow you to test with already written clients (like a web browser) to retrieve the files.";;
"If you are working alone: 1. Install VS Community Edition. 2. Profit.

If you are working on larger projects, especially with a team: it is extremely useful if you can setup a new development environment in as little time as possible. One easy way to achieve this would be to use VM's.

1. New developers can get started right away, instead of following long, poorly written setup documents.

2. You want all developers to work on exactly the same environment. How many projects I've seen that require a local *./SQLEXPRESS* or point to *D:/test.txt* or a require a certain assembly in your GAC... Obviously this is bad practice and you want to avoid it, but that doesn't make it not happen.

3. You want to encourage developers to mess around. *What would happen to our WebApp if I install this weird Chrome plugin?* or *Would changing these IIS settings improve caching performance?*. It is often hard to revert these changes so a developer will avoid doing this if he knows that getting a new environment might take days.";;
"What's the problem in running a local database for your project, when it is run in development mode?

In web development, it's pretty common that you use a local DB and run the website locally, that way you can mess with the site as much as you please without interfering with anyone else working on it.

Obviously any other environment needs to have a DB dedicated to it, and not be run locally.";;
"Don't get me wrong. There is nothing wrong with a local database! There's no excuse for not developing on a local database.

The problem is that the SQL service instance might be named differently on different machines. Some developers might have SQL express installed whereas some might have installed a different edition. This can sometimes cause conflicts in connection strings. It was just an example of why you'd want all environments to be equal.";;
"The easiest way would be to download and install Visual Studio Community. The download is large and the install takes a while (maybe 15-20 minutes), but once it's on there development is easy. It has everything you need including a local webserver.

In terms of setting up a VM, you could if you want to isolate Visual Studio from your computer, but there is no reason to otherwise. The same applies for renting a server, you don't need one until it's time to deploy. Renting one for the sake of developing, when you have windows locally or on a local vm is a waste imo.

At work our developers all have visual studio locally and code directly on there. They use the built in IIS express web server and can debug and get their work done.  They check in using git and then our release team puts that on the server. This workflow is pretty efficient and we've built large scale websites this way.

The reason it seems like tutorials dont cover the best way is because the best way is as easy as installing visual studio and just doing it.";;
"Except for *really* weird configurations, you don't have to worry about isolating your libraries and runtime. 

The build process will put all your managed DLL references (even if they came from source) in the Debug/Release directory so all your dependencies will be be in there. Your assembly manifest XML will specify versions if some of your references share dependencies.

All the .NET versions run side by side and newer CLR versions are backwards compatible with old ones, so you just need to make sure that the latest .NET runtime framework is installed on the target machine.

Do be careful if you're getting packages from NuGet though - it's a little eager to update to the latest versions of things, so check your .packages files into source control.";;
"online classes are kind of bad IMO and no job will actually take them seriously. They are however pretty good for learning the material first through them then building a project with what you learned and then show that to an employer. They are definitely not a substitute for any type of degree.

Yea, I thought so.

"It seems you are just starting out with Java. There are a few things going on here (in order):

1. Class 'DogEx' cannot see class 'Dog' because 'Dog' is inside the main method. If a class is defined in a method, it is a local class (ie. only available within the method).
2. class 'Dog' has not been initialized yet, since its definition is after the instantiation.
3. See 2
4. This is a simple String error: java is looking for a *variable* named 'woof'. I think you mean to write: String w = ""woof""
5. Again, the class 'Dog' cannot see into the main method to find the variable 'd'.
6. This is actually valid code! It fails because of error 1.

I think you want something like this:

    public class TestCode{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        DogEx d = new DogEx();
        d.Method();
       }
    }


    class DogEx extends Dog {

        void Method(){
        String w = ""woof"";
        Bark(w);
        System.out.println(x);
        }
    }

	abstract class Dog{
        int x = 5;

        void Bark(String w){
            System.out.println(w);  
        }
    }

Edit: okay, i see your challenge is to get those printed using *only* sub and super classes (and not a direct method call as in line 4 of my code). Here's how to do it. You will probably have to read up on java constructors to understand this:

    public class TestCode{

    public static void main(String[] args){

        Dog d = new DogEx();
    }
    }


    class DogEx extends Dog {
	public DogEx(){
		Method();
	}

        void Method(){
        String w = ""woof"";
        Bark(w);
        System.out.println(x);
        }
    }

	abstract class Dog{
        int x = 5;

        void Bark(String w){
            System.out.println(w);  
        }
    }

"Very nice explanation; thank you very much!

And thank you for the offer, I'll try to not be too bothersome.";;
"You really should start by getting into the habit of giving each class you create it's own Java file. A class-inside-a-class (of which there are two specific variations) have very specific uses, uses which don't really concern beginners. You can also never ever define a class inside a method; your code won't compile for that reason alone.

Java is a strict statically typed language. That means it (like computers) it will only do exactly what you tell it to do, without it trying to guess what you mean. If you assign something that doesn't exist (String w = woof where woof is interpreted as a var that you didn't define) it will simply tell you you made a mistake.

A few tips (aside from the excellent suggestions from /u/WhyYouLetRomneyWin)  to make life easier for you and the people who have to read your code:

* Every class gets it's own .java file
* Methods shouldcamelCased, classnames are PascalCased. 
* Use implicit access modifiers; make what needs to be public public, the others private. Leaving it out actually gives it 'default' access which is a tad complex to understand for beginners (it's between private and protected in access level).";;
"In the loop where you read in the file, you can just use **while (true)** to have it run until the **break**. Alternatively, you could use something like:

    String line;
    while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null)
         dict.add(line);

which is a bit more compact and, I think, a bit easier to read. That syntax has been around forever (literally in the K&R book on C), so people know to look for it, although it can be argued that putting that much code in the loop condition is not good.

I would also generally avoid needlessly lengthy things. For example, you have a 1/3 chance of appending a comma from lines 76 to 86, which is 11 lines with all the comments and whitespace, when something like

    if (generator.nextInt(3) == 0)
         builder.append("","");

would do the same thing.

At line 100, you have

    //Generate a random int between 0 and 4.
    int punctChoice = generator.nextInt(4);

which actually generates a number between 0 and 3, so you'll never append a ""!"". Again, I'd write something shorter like

    char[] punct = { '.', '.', '.', '?', '!' };
    builder.append(punct[generator.nextInt(punct.length)]);

but it could be argued that your switch-case approach is more readable.

Finally, one generally good idea when developing code with random numbers is to set the seed manually (or record the seed at each execution) until you're reasonably sure the bugs are gone. This way, if something triggers a bug, you can start with the same seed a second time and debug that same sequence of pseudo-random numbers.

Hope some of that was useful!";;
Wow, I hadn't even thought of using a chat array for punctuation! And that random gen code is much cleaner, thanks!;;
"Thanks to your comments and others, I have cleaned up the code! It looks pretty snazzy.

http://pastebin.com/7GVbjpda

Thanks so much for the tips!";;
"Here are some thoughts (note that my experience with Java is as a hobbyist, I've never worked in the language professionally):

You can combine the declaration and assignment of reader. So it would just be:

    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader([filereader])

I get the impulse for the corny joke, but while(pigs != fly) doesn't actually work for me, because it reads as ""while pigs is not equal to fly"". That's maybe just me, though.

You could probably declare ""line"" outside of the loop and then use something like while((line = reader.readLine()) != null) as your looping condition. Then you wouldn't need the break statement. In my experience, infinite loops used like this are bad practice.

I would declare the Random and StringBuilder objects (and the scanner, for that matter) at the top of the class (also, I would name the Random object just ""random""), so that someone reading the class is not surprised by the additional objects to keep track of in the middle of reading through the code.

You don't really gain a lot by wrapping System.out.print and println in their own functions. I guess maybe you save the typing of ""System.out.print"" a few times, but you've also introduced cryptically short function names, so anyone reading the class will have to scroll down to figure out what ""sop"" and ""sopl"" means, which costs time, so you've probably netted nothing.

I would probably define ""reasonable"" for the user, just to make the program's expectations more clear.

You can combine the declaration and initialization of ""randComma"". Alternatively, you could eliminate randComma altogether and just say: if ((generator.nextInt(3) + 1) == 2) {}

You can eliminate punctChoice as well, and just move generator.nextInt(4) into the switch line.

This is very silly and it's only something I demand in code reviews on my team at work, but when you're using fall-through in a switch/case, I like there to be a comment in there that explicitly states that it is intentionally being used. That said, I like the randomized punctuation.

You missed an opportunity to use ""sopl()"".

As I said, I probably would not have the wrappers around print and println, but if you needed them, I would give the object argument a better name than ""o"". I have no idea how the Java community in general (or the /r/learnprogramming community for that matter) feels about single-letter variable names, but they are explicitly disallowed by the coding standard I have to follow at work.

Now, all that aside, it looks like a good project. You had an idea, you executed it, you commented the code well, and (I assume) it does exactly what you set out to do. Well done!
";;
"I would also like to mention that the default name for a java.util.Random in my textbook is generator, so... hmm.

Was my teacher incorrect that naming object the same as their class name is bad practice? Like:

    Hippo hippo = new Hippo();

?";;
"They're not incorrect. Normally, you'll want to give your variables descriptive names that will make reading your code easier. In the specific case of the Random object though, you'll only ever have one (usually), and ""random"" is more descriptive in my opinion, than ""generator"". Because a ""generator"" could be generating anything, but a ""random"" sounds more like a source of random numbers. It's mostly a matter of style, I think.

All the time. I'm not ashamed of it. I switch between languages so often that there's no point in keeping syntax details in my head.;;

Instead of `.eof()` you should check the return value of the read operation itself. `inputFile >> Score` evaluates to true if it reads a number successfully.

";;
">But when ever I try to think them in terms of what most people use them for multidimensional arrays. I just get confused and frustrated

Well, as you may already know, you can use a pointer to refer to an array. It's really just pointing to the first element of the array. In C and C++, passing an array as an argument is actually degrading the argument to such a pointer. So we can do:

    int* pointer = new int[3];

And in memory, we have an array that the `pointer` variable points to:

      _ _ _
     | | | |
      ¯ ¯ ¯
      ^ ^ ^
      | | \__ `pointer + 2` points to this
      |  \___ `pointer + 1` points to this
       \_____ `pointer` points to this

With a pointer to a pointer, it's best to think of it as the first pointer points to some arbitrary thing and what remains tells us the *type* of what we're pointing at. So an `int**` being dereferenced leaves us with `int*`, which is the type being pointed at (and as previously shown, that type can be an array).

Alternatively, you might find it easier to think of these arrays as merely a contiguous block of memory. So there might be one `int*` or there might be many `int*`. You have to keep track of how many, since trying to access memory outside of this contiguous block of memory is undefined behavior.";;
I like your ascii art :) I understand a pointer to the starting address of an array. Its just visualising the double pointers as an 2D array that troubling;;
"Ok, so suppose instead of that single array shown above, I actually have 3 arrays, constructed like:

	int numArrays = 3;
	int** arrayOfArrays = new int*[numArrays];
	for(int i = 0; i < numArrays; ++i) {
		arrayOfArrays[i] = new int[5];
	}

Now if we go to `arrayOfArrays[0]` (the equivalent of `*(arrayOfArrays + 0)`), then we get a pointer. Specifically a pointer to an array (of size 5).

Note that this is different from something like `int[][]`. There's a reason we must pass the size of secondary parameters into functions (eg, `void foo(int[][5] arg)` takes in a 2D array where the second argument must be of size 5). This is because 2D arrays declared as such are actually contiguous blocks of memory themselves. The code shown above differs in that the arrays inside `arrayOfArrays` are all independent (and thus the 2D array is not guaranteed to be contiguous).

If you tried to use an `int[][5]` where we expect an `int**`, it won't work. You'll get an error like ""`cannot convert 'int (*)[5]' to 'int**'`"". Note how the actual type is a pointer to something of type `int[5]`?";;
Make much more sense. Thanks a lot. What would be some practical use of double pointers other than data structures or using it as an argument in a function to change the address stored?;;
Make much more sense. Thanks a lot. What would be some practical use of double pointers other than data structures or using it as an argument in a function to change the address stored;;
"As mentioned, you'd use it to take in an argument to a function. The main function does this:

    int main(int argc, const char** argv)

The `argv` (""argument values"") is an array of char arrays (aka a C string). `argc` is the number of arguments (the size of the outside array). The size of the inside arrays are not stored anywhere because C strings end with `'\0'`. You'd use it like:

    #include<cstdio> // Use #include ""stdio.h"" for C

    int main(int argc, const char** argv) {
        for(int i = 0; i < argc; ++i) {
            printf(""%s\n"", argv[i]);
        }
    }

Then if you run your program as `./a.out 1 foo ""hello world""`, the output is:

    ./a.out
    1
    foo
    hello world

Note that the first argument is always the name of the program.

Using this for dynamic arrays is the most common. You can also note that multi-dimension arrays that use this can be jagged (the individual arrays can have different lengths). That's the case for the above, where we have different length strings (remember that each of those C strings is an array).

And of course, you can have even higher dimension arrays. Eg, `int***` would be a 3D array. The fact that you don't have to know the size of the inner arrays makes this more useful than declaring your multi-dimension arrays on the stack (eg, with `int foo[5][5]`).

Off topic, but of importance is the fact that a considerable deal of real world code does not use arrays. In C++, `std::vector` is the preferred data structure for array-like data. It's far more featureful and includes ways to determine the size of the vector (a major annoyance with arrays is that you must pass around the size of the array everywhere). C doesn't have much of a standard library, so third party code or your own solution is needed.

Most other languages provide something along the lines of a ""list"" (eg, Java has `ArrayList`, C# has `List`, Python has `list`, etc). These usually work the same way as `std::vector`.";;
"So, everyone here is talking about arrays... but that's over-complicating things.

A pointer is a pointer. It is never anything different.  A pointer lets you say ""int \*foo;"" which provides you with ""foo is a named variable that points to the location in memory where there is an integer"".  If I were to change that to ""int \*\*foo"" you'd read that as ""foo is a named variable that points to the location in memory where there is a 'pointer to an integer' ""

So, what *are* pointers good for? they let you reference something, and change it.
Consider:

    int x, i, j;
    int *y = &x;
    int *w = &j;
    int **z = &y;

What can you do with this?  You can consider what is manipulate-able here.

    x = 5; // you can change the value of X
    *y = 6; // this also changes the value of X
    y = &i; // y now points to something different
    *y = 7; // this changed I

And the double pointer is no different, i just gives you more positibilites:

    y = &x;  // you change the value of Y
    *z = &i;  // you change the value of Y
    **z = 6; // that changed I
    *y = 7; // this also changed I
    z = &w; // Z now points to something different
    *z = &i;  // this changed W
    **z = 8; // this still changed I
    *w = 9; // because this changes I

So, why is that useful?  It means you have more options to pass things to and from functions:

    void foo(int x) {
       x = 5;  // this doesn't change anything in the caller
    }
    void foo(int *x) {
       x = new int; // this also doesn't change anything in the caller
    }
    void foo(int **x) {
       x = new int; // and this can't change anything either :(
    }
    // as seen above ""x"" itself can be manipulated in the function, but it doesn't affect the caller.
    // but when X is a pointer, it points to something you CAN manipulate
    void bar(int *x) {
       *x = 5; // this however, DOES change the caller
    }
    // So, you can, as above, change the value from the caller
    int y = 2;
    bar(&y);
    // y now equals 5. YAY!
    std::cout << y;

    void bar(int **x) {
       *x = new int; // this ALSO changes something in the caller
       **x = 5; // and so would this.
    }
    // And, as above here, you can now change even more stuff
    int *y = NULL;
    bar(&y);
    // now y points to a integer with value 5. YAY!
    std::cout << *y;

Purely habit for me because i think it looks the cleanest. Its not a big deal for a query with 3 columns but when you start bringing in many more columns along with aggregates, you're joining from 10+ tables, etc. things can get messy quick.

"You can group by C and count the number of records in each group. If there's more than 1 record in the group, then that group is a duplicate.

You didn't mention a specific DBMS (and that does matter), so I can't do more than point you in the right [google search query](https://www.google.ca/search?q=sql+number+of+group+rows). You'll need a nested query (although for all I know, there's a better solution -- SQL is not my forte).";;
[deleted];;
"There's standards, but they aren't well followed. A lot of the basics are the same across DBMSes, but the specifics get crazy different.

For example, Postgres has a really awesome keyword `RETURNING` which allows you to return a value after inserting, typically an auto-incrementing value (which you wouldn't know until you do the insert). That can be used to create references to the record. MySQL does not have such a keyword. Boo MySQL. Plenty of other differences in syntax, too (that's just one off the top of my head).

Eg, for updating from a subquery, Postgres has:

	UPDATE some_table
	SET customer = subquery.customer,
	    address = subquery.address
	FROM (SELECT address_id, customer, address
	      FROM some_other_table) AS subquery
	WHERE some_table.address_id = subquery.address_id;

Which is cleaner than some of the other options. As a result, it's often a good idea to take advantage of your DBMS's features. For yet another example, in Postgres, it's usually preferably to use `TEXT` as the type instead of `VARCHAR`. Under the hood, they're stored the same way.

In SQLite, the number of data types is much more general. `NULL`, `INTEGER`, `REAL`, `TEXT`, and `BLOB`. `VARCHAR` is nothing more than an alias.

And if you wanted a full text search, Postgres has some nifty features for this, namely the `TSVECTOR` (""text search vector"") and `TSQUERY` types, which make full text searches easy (they work on [lexemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme), not full words) and take the language into account.";;

I figured, I had enough knowledge to at least make a brief tutorial series on the basics, while applying what I learned from the course to an extrapolated view from what I've worked on.

>__Monte Carlo methods__ (or __Monte Carlo experiments__) are a broad class of [computational](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation) [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that rely on repeated [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random) sampling to obtain numerical results. They are often used in [physical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) and [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) problems and are most useful when it is difficult or impossible to use other mathematical methods. Monte Carlo methods are mainly used in three distinct problem classes: [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization), [numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wikiumerical_integration), and generating draws from a [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution).

>In physics-related problems, Monte Carlo methods are quite useful for simulating systems with many [coupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupling_(physics\)) degrees of freedom, such as fluids, disordered materials, strongly coupled solids, and cellular structures (see [cellular Potts model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_Potts_model), [interacting particle systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interacting_particle_systems), [McKean-Vlasov processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKean%E2%80%93Vlasov_process), [kinetic models of gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_theory)). Other examples include modeling phenomena with significant [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty) in inputs such as the calculation of [risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk) in business and, in math, evaluation of multidimensional [definite integrals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral) with complicated boundary conditions. In application to space and oil exploration problems, Monte Carlo–based predictions of failure, [cost overruns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cost_overrun) and schedule overruns are routinely better than human intuition or alternative ""soft"" methods. 

>In principle, Monte Carlo methods can be used to solve any problem having a probabilistic interpretation. By [the law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers), integrals described by the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of some random variable can be approximated by taking the [empirical mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sample_mean_and_sample_covariance) (a.k.a. the sample mean) of independent samples of the variable. When the [probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_distribution) of the variable is too complex, we often use a [Markov Chain Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo) (MCMC) sampler. The central idea is to design a judicious [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) model with a prescribed [stationary probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_probability_distribution)[.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_distribution) By the [ergodic theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_theorem), the [stationary probability distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_probability_distribution) is approximated by the [empirical measures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_measure) of the random states of the MCMC sampler.

If you can break a big problem into small problems and then express the solutions to those small problems in a language that computers can understand, you can code.

The disconcerting part is when there is no ""big"" problem to break down into smaller problems yet, so I'm faced with the smallest building block and am just trying to look at it from different angles. It's like, I'm not even trying to write a sentence yet, or even a word: I'm looking at the letter p and thinking ""Okay... that kind of looks like an upside-down ""b""... or maybe a ""d"" that's been rotated 180 degrees"" and trying to make sense of it!";;

The trick with programming is you have to practice it. You'll never learn to program by reading and doing already prepared exercises. You'll learn syntax, not programming. 

Come up with a small program you'd like to make. Maybe some sort of guessing game? Maybe something mathematical like a sequence generator? Find something that interests you and make it. 

You're going to get stuck, and you're going to have to go to those resources you mentioned. When you're forced to apply these foreign concepts to actually solve a problem, you'll begin to develop the logic side of programming.

"Hey! Glad you can relate. Makes me feel that much better that you also faced similar challenges.

I'm eager to start making my own projects. It's just that issue of ""You don't know what you don't know"", you know?

I'd like to make some kind of simple calculating program that lets the user input a)The total length of the video, and b)The speed at which they are watching it. In turn, the program would output how long the ""new"" video length would be, and how much time they would save by watching it at the respective speed. Unfortunately, I really just don't think I have the skills so execute this successfully yet, which is frustrating!

I've hesitated to post anything for a while, partly out of stubbornness and partly because I'm afraid of receiving ""Just fucking Google it"" backlash. I can't see myself daring to post anything on SO either (those guys look vicious!), but today was a particularly low day for me so I figured I could steal a little Reddit bandwidth for this question.";;
The trick I learned early on was to repeat an exercise if it didn't seem to sink in. Not immediately. Just like... Wait a week and then go do it over again.;;
"I was considering this approach, so I'm glad you brought it up. I took a break from web development stuff specifically to focus on more ""legit"" programming (please don't kill me web devs everywhere; as a beginner I really don't know how else to phrase it, but I hope you know what I mean) like Python, and when I decided to go back to the web dev stuff, it came to me much more easily. I think there's been research about spaced repetition or something like that, so I'm not sure if that's the same concept.

It can be frustrating to let go of a problem for the day if you've been trying to brute-force it into your brain by way of staring at it for hours, but this is most likely the smartest approach. Come back at it with a fresh brain the next day. Again, though, maybe I'm just having a hard time gauging my ability since I have nobody else to compare it to, so I'm not sure if I'm chugging along at an average pace or not.";;
What I hear is that, even though you think you aren't working on it, the silent half of your brain still is--like, taking what you learned and organizing it so you can use it more effectively next time.;;
"Don't forget that computer are the stupidest thing you can ever imagine. It's hard to learn how to talk to a stupid person in ways it can understands.

Imagine writing a recipe for a cook who never saw a spoon or food in his life. You need to explain to him step by step, and you can't gloss over things because he *will* do exactly what you told him to do, with no common sense, and he will do nothing more, and nothing less.

While dumb, computers have a perfect memory. So once you teach your cook how to peel onions, you don't have to teach him again. You can say to him ""now this is a task you know, if I give you onions you can cut them and give them back"". This is what a function is.

If/else does have the same meaning as you would use in English while you are writing your cooking instruction. 

TL;DR. Talking to stupid is hard.";;
"I got it to work.  Basically, you should create the element and then place it.  You should make it a jQuery object.  Here's the (rough) code that makes it work. 

    $(document).ready(function(){
      $('div').draggable({});
  
    var newDiv = $('<div>').draggable({});
  
    $('button').click(function(){
        $('html').append(newDiv);
        });
    });

You should probably refactor.";;
"This would lessen the amount of code but would take a good amount of refactoring on my program. Thanks for the answer!

EDIT: the example has been updated to your solution, however i'm not going to mark this post as solved just yet to see if someone can answer my other two questions.

EDIT 2: there actually is an issue though. This method doesn't allow me to append more than one div.";;
"To nest them, just make the div created when the button is clicked like this:

    $(document).ready(function(){
      $('div').draggable({});
  
      $('button').click(function(){
         var newDiv = $('<div>').draggable({}); 
         $('html').append(newDiv);

       });
    });

The above code works like this. When the DOM has loaded, first select all div elements and make them draggable.  Then listen for the click event on the button.  When pushed, create a new jQuery element that is draggable and assign it to the variable newDiv.  Finally, append that newDiv to the html.  When the button is clicked again, the variable newDiv is recreated because it is only scoped from inside the click handler callback function.

As for your last question, not sure about mobile editing.  The problem is that coding generally requires a good keyboard and the sites that have IDEs won't work very well and to my knowledge sublime/atom/vim/emacs and other text editors aren't very mobile friendly or able to be apps.  I could be wrong though.

";;
"Woooooooah, a new bug has arisen. The source of my example has been updated and something is horribly wrong. [Add multiple divs and try dragging them.](http://codepen.io/anon/pen/aOGOym) More specifically add two new divs, drag the third one and then try dragging the second.

Also, I figured a mobile friendly text editor was a bit farfetched but I figured i'd ask anyway. Thanks";;
"This seems to be an issue with having multiple draggable instances.  It depends on what's going on under the hood.  This is a discussion that talks about something similar: http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/multiple-jquery-draggable-instances/65390.

"Hmmmmm... The forum you linked me to seems more like an issue with .droppable and the github link looks like it allows an item to be dragged and drags another item at the same time.

EDIT: what's even more odd is that it only happens to the div that is furthest up.

" .NET very much does not rock

edit: lol lotta cranky .net devs here apparently ";;
Why do i hear about .net so often? What's the deal? How does it fit into the programming ecosystem? (Beginner programmer);;
.NET is a common framework and set of libraries that all .NET languages share. You don't program directly in .NET; instead, you write code in C# or Visual Basic and those are compiled into a general .NET/CLR executable. For example, I could write a C# server and a Visual Basic client which both leverage the .NET networking classes, and then reference those compiled projects/assemblies in F# for some other project, and it all just works together. (This is called language interoperability.);
.NET also has implications of locking you into a vendor and a lot of legacy bullshit around it as well as horrible things like VB and ASP aside from relegating you mostly to windows and more windows solutions. Aside from shit loads of money in licensing fees, etc, etc, etc.;;
"Ahh the good ol' anti-Windows bandwagon comes rolling in when someone asks what .NET is.

> .NET also has implications of locking you into a vendor

.NET works well with many non-.NET frameworks and languages, and it's only getting better.

> and a lot of legacy bullshit around it

Language interoperability and backwards compatability, to work with things that were made at a time where stuff wasn't as easy.

> as well as horrible things like VB and ASP

Don't use VB and ASP then. Mix and match however you want.

> aside from relegating you mostly to windows and more windows solutions.

Check out Mono, it's .NET for other operating systems.

> Aside from shit loads of money in licensing fees, etc, etc, etc.

Visual Studio Express and TFS Express are both free and licensed for commercial use.";;
I know its out there, I remember using Mono a few years ago and it was a POS. ;;
"I'll be forever grateful for the Microsoft (.NET) ecosystem that got me my first job and that probably can be said by a vast majority given the footprint Microsoft has. 

Like others have said, it's not going away. Microsoft has a huge stranglehold on large corporations so there, seemingly, will be a need for .NET devs. ";;
It's for sure not going away, the corporate world is locked in. Still feel bad for my buddy that is writing ASP and fixing/updating legacy VB. Don't wish that on anyone.;;
Yeah, that is a miserable part of the process. I started WebForms and worked my way up through the iterations of ASP.NET MVC to finally doing the SQL Server, Node and Angular stack I work with now but there's occasions where we see something come in using classic ASP;;
"The Microsoft ecosystem isn't going away.  Its quite powerful,  and the profession pays very well.  You may not like its ethos,  but its far from something to avoid because of ""a vendor."" This aint Johnny's crab shack and battery emporium. It aint going anywhere.  

If people like working with .Net, good on them.  The more people programming in anything,  the better. ";;
I'm well aware the microsoft ecosystem isn't going away, that doesn't refute anything I said. ;;
"Your comments in the thread are being largely dismissive of one the largest players in an industry. Its like ignoring samsung in the mobile market, or Toyota in cars. 

I dont program in .Net, but its good for people to understand that its a powerful thing out there. I would prefer a pure unix utopia, but its not a reality. Microsoft has a huge heap of the buisness market locked down with AD/Office/Exchange. Millions of businesses have built 100s of billions of dollars on top of this lockin, and most are salivating at a chance to hire someone to squeeze even more money out of it.

"Be more sensitive, man, really. Think of the starving families!

"This is kinda a stupid thing, but it confused me for a while while I was trying to learn - github is not git. There's git, which you can do entirely on your own computer from the command line without ever touching the internet, and then there's github, which is like a social network around coding, which uses git.

Learn git first, use it religiously on your projects for a while (locally, don't worry about seeing up remotes), and then check out github again. The Atlassian git tutorial is really great for learning (no link because I'm on my phone, but it's easy to find), and I think once you understand what git is and how it works, github will make a lot more sense. Atlassian also has a service to host your code (bitbucket), but I don't think it's any easier than github. ";;
I think in general, bitbucket is better for hosting code for yourself, you [get unlimited private repos for up to five people](https://bitbucket.org/plans), were as github is better for sharing code, you [get unlimited public repos with unlimited sharing](https://github.com/pricing). ;;
There's also github student pack, which gets you some private repos. Sometimes it can take a while to get verified, though.;;
Have been waiting 2 weeks already. :);;
Took me like 2 months to get it.;;
Really? Mine went through in less than a day.;;
"When they announced the student pack the waiting times shot up. I did mine a year before and had no issues. Some people I know registered as they needed access to UE4 and it took them over a month.

It also depends on what you put in there from what I've seen. I had to renew mine and it took less than a week, but I put in about how I wanted to use Github to collaborate on coursework projects. Others I know said ""I want to use UE4"" and had to wait.";;

That. Github pages now supports Jekyll, a static-site generator.

Linux and Mac for me.

When deciding between Linux and Mac... if you want apps like SketchUp, AutoCAD and all that, get a Mac. If you're okay without all that, Linux is just fine.

"When we hire interns or level 1s where I work, we only expect them to be able to learn. Not even particularly fast. It takes time to come up to speed on a proprietary system. You just have to be eager and demonstrate some aptitude.

You will almost certainly have access to more senior developers who you can go to when you have questions or don't know where to start. Learn who is receptive to that, and someone will be, then just go to them when you need something. Try to find the answer yourself, of course. Initiative is greatly appreciated. If you're given documentation to read, it will almost certainly be deathly boring. Try to slog through it though, it will probably come in handy later.";;

This x1000. Companies don't hire interns or low level engineers expecting them to know it all (unless they're a crappy company)... it's just unrealistic. They hire someone that seems like they're smart, willing to learn, and a good fit for the organization. If you can demonstrate your ability to learn and grow quickly, you'll do just fine!;;
"I'm interning right now and for me it was pretty much a given that I wouldn't know all that much(I'm a freshman), so our situations will be a bit different.

But in general I'm given a task that's rather abstract like go make a function that does ""x and x"", or go make a test for some other function. So if I run into trouble I usually spend 3 hours to even a day to essentially fill any gaps of knowledge I have.

Now because you are finishing your degree you will probably be expected to know a bit more, so I would ask your employer what languages you are going to be working in, and either purchase a textbook or two since you have 6 months. Conversely you could just use Google, but if you are sticking to just one topic (for example if you only wanted to learn Ruby) I would get a textbook as just googling will most likely leave you with a few gaps of knowledge, although they will be easy to fill if you are able to identify them (which is the hard part haha).

Basically if you are proactive and learn ahead of time you will be crystal. And don't worry yourself about getting fired or anything, they hired you as an intern not only because they wanted you, but because they need work to be done, and since its only 6 months it would probably be way too much hassle to hire and you find a replacement haha.

Good luck!!! =\^)";;

I'm a month and a half in now and I learn something new each day. 

I wouldn't think an employer would expect much from an intern, so it's easy to wow them. 
Just keep learning and developing your skills and don't be afraid to ask questions. My supervisor told me they like when interns ask questions cause they want employees that can communicate with and help eachother.

If you have any questions, let me know (as someone who's essentially future you).";;
"Internships have a large spectrum of difficulty. Some have lots of responsibility and are challenging and some are... well... less so in both regards. I've done 3 software development internships ranging from trivial to extremely involved.

Find out what your company uses in terms of languages, frameworks, OS and libraries. If you already have the internship, ask what your responsibilities will be and what's actually expected of you (I would ask those questions in the future during interviews).

I don't want to overwhelm you but... If you have free time and you're starting in 6 months. Have you thought about getting a sooner internship? My first two internships were only 3 months (I could've stayed longer and went to the next level of intern but I had already received  better offers).

"I'm currently an intern at a fortune 500, huge company. I'll be a junior cs major next year. My first month+ has been straight training. 40 hrs a week in class, or scrolling through documentation.

I also really want to learn how to program, and I've heard it's easier and more fun to  ""learn"" while actually making a program you need ATM/ one you'll use alot";;
"I hear that all the time (make a program you need.)   I'm not sure that's really good advice, and this is a terrific case in point.  

So this problem could be solved in a couple of ways.  

1. Use command line tools (like ffmpeg) and do a little bit of scripting to automate the process. This will solve the problem, but you'll learn very little actual programming, and the language may not be that great (especially in Windows - Batch programming in Windows is not a very complete language)

2. Use a low-level language to directly manipulate the data of the audio files.  This is a much more powerful approach, but it's not something that is appropriate for a beginner. 

So essentially you'll either make it too easy or too hard.  All to often, the experience is frustrating and you never really learn.  One day on this sub should provide ample evidence of this phenomenon.

The problem with 'real world' problems is that the real world is messy.  If you want to be a race car driver, what you should do is jump in an Indy car and just turn left while mashing down that accelerator.  That's a lot more fun and realistic than learning about how to drive, traffic laws, and how racing works.  

If you're a beginner, it's very difficult for you to know what's easy or difficult to do, and you're very likely to pick a project that you're just not ready for.

The best approach is to have an experienced teacher walk through a few ideas in isolation, then pick a  small project that requires only those skills.  Then learn some more skills and do a new 'real' project that uses only the accumulated skills.";;

Another way to put it, what is `1+3*5` 20 or 16? Why? * has a higher precedence than +.;;
"Precedence just means what happens first.  Consider the expression `x || y && z`.  Is this interpreted as `(x || y) && z` or is it `x || (y && z)`?  Precedence answers that question - && has higher precedence than || so it's `x || (y && z)`.

According to the accepted answer here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21060234/ruby-operator-precedence-table

He'll be up at 1 AM and he'll help you with your code, etc. Pretty cool guy. ""Once you've stopped the bleeding, you'll realized you've learned something."" is a pretty common saying about his class.";;
I had a class like that in second year. Maybe not quite as bad (average wasn't 25, yikes), but it was pretty infamous for having brutal assignments that required a lot of pain and all nighters to finish. It's still by far the most rewarding course I've taken, period.;;
It's pretty cool that the classes that pick you apart to the bone and make you want to kill yourself are the most rewarding haha;;
Same here, even down to Data Structures in Java. It was brutal, but I loved it and learned a ton.;;
"There is a difference between difficult and ridiculous, though. I am a Berkeley alum and I don't remember Hilfinger being considered a bad professor. If the material is presented to you then it is yours to study and learn.

That's why you have after hours access to Soda Hall.";;
Oh I never meant to call him a bad professor. He just has a reputation for being super tough.;;
Unfortunately, this would be a different scenario. There can be difference between difficult and incompetent haha;;
Oh I thought this post was about just like scary teachers not bad teachers. My bad;;
"yeah people seem to think im complaining about it being ""hard"" thats not the case. its INCOHERENT.  
i like hard. i like challenging. i dont like unintentionally difficult because of incompetence.

i was doing JUST FINE learning to program on my own. i could've gone out for some interviews by now. but i thought itd be a good idea to get a degree. -- people here act like the degree is supposed to be impossibly difficult.  Gettign a good grade in CS does nothing to secure a job.  PROJECTS and  PORTFOLIOs do.  im a little amazed at how much emphasis people put on ""going through bullshit"" to get a degree, rather than ""go through a really good program""";;
"From everything I've read, it's clear that you're both easily upset by trivial things and convinced you know better than your instructors. You've argued with people who have completed CS degrees about several things, and that doesn't help your case at all. We've all taken these courses and had bad professors. We know how it goes. Your case isn't unique. 

You're in an Intro to CS. That is not meant to be anything more than a primer on the absolute basics, which includes digital circuits. If you've learned to do a single output, multiple outputs shouldn't be mind blowing. While your university may be a rare case, I think that you're suffering from a very typical issue of an ego convincing you of things that aren't necessarily correct. The format you've described does not seem out of the ordinary, and a quiz that people did poorly on doesn't confirm an issue with the program. It confirms that the students did not know the material. When it comes to circuits at any level, that tends to be true.";;
"im arguing with people who apparently dont believe shitty teachers exist and im the problem. sorry for defending myself. i agree its futile.

and now you are implying im lying about the difficulty of the circuit tests and i have an ego? ?  

hilarious, another person with ""speculation"" to add despite not knowing the details beyond my post.  you know who also has a CS degree? MY CS TEACHER!  wow, CS people who think they are right? thats a new one.

you people are telling me what im experiencing is not what im experiencing. Who has the ego here?  so you're allowed to be ""right"" but i have an ego. gotcha";;

or maybe i just have a shitty teacher. nope, couldn't possible be that.  there is no way i'm smart enough to detect flaws in teaching.;;
You say you're ahead of the class but yet you're running into all these issues. Maybe you're not as smart as you think. ;;
or maybe i have a shitty teacher.  nope, couldn't possibly be that.;;
"Objective reader here, it reads like both cases are true.  You're quick to argue and put down the merits of a degree, which speaks of an ego problem.  At the same time, I absolutely agree some teachers can be frustrating, so I believe your original story.

You can't do much about the teacher, but you could benefit from being less defensive.  You're taking an intro to CS class, right?  Accept that you have a lot to learn (as do we all) and work on being less argumentative and more humble.";;
"i think people fundamentally miss the point that im not acting like i know more than the teacher about the subject. im just pointing out that there are plenty of flaws that ANYONE with an attention to detail will notice.  im a student right now. but i've also programmed java for almost 2 years now.  The way they are teaching is extremely difficult for the people who haven't done the work on their own.  I KNOW they are bad at teaching Java, because I already know what they are trying to teach.  So its not a stretch for me to imagine that hes bad at teaching the things i dont  know. it doesnt mean he doesnt know the subject. he just can't teach it.  im a teacher myself. communication is FUNDAMENTAL.

i have no problem with seeing my errors. but i take issue with people telling me im lying, exaggerating, or not trying hard enough.  I probably should just ignore those comments, because they are all Strawmen of positions i never held or asserted.

there is no question about whether my take on things is correct. ive verified it with plenty of other students.  i think some people in this thread need to strive to be humble and not assume they know more about my situation than i do.

im not putting down the merits of a degree. im putting down the fact that If i graduate from my school with a degree, and a guy down at the neighboring university graduates with a degree,  we both have the same ""certification"" but HE HAD A BETTER EDUCATION THAN ME.  the employers will only see the certification and the portfolios.  I have to see the shitty teaching i received.

we might end up being ""equals"" but id prefer the ""good teaching route"" rather than the bad, if all is equal";;

We figured out pretty quickly that there was no reason to go to class since we could download the slides. The first test was insanely hard - the class average was less than 10%, and the second test was super easy because he over compensated. The rest of the tests oscillated back and forth, eventually arriving at the appropriate difficulty.

why would i lie about any of this?  my school doesn't even offer an EE degree.  Circuits are a pretty integral part of computers. why dont you think that would be a subject? Its in every CS book.  Logic gates are at the base of every computer. how is that not relevant? 

""given how irrational you've shown yourself to be""  right back at ya. what did i do that was irrational?  explain. you aren't living my life and aren't taking my classes. i simply told you what im experiencing.  how can you begin to judge what is right or wrong in the situation?

edit: It's not about any one of these things. if it was just ONE of them, i wouldn't bitch and moan.  its that it seems like its something new every class.  They compounded each other.  There is a fundamental issue with his teaching.";;
This sounds like the kind of thing you need to take to the head of the department.;;
"> and why is #3 minor? the instructions were WRONG. Minor errors in an algorithm cause SERIOUS PROBLEMS. this is logic 101

It's a typo. I understand that you're upset about it, on top of all of the other things you're upset about, but it's not abnormal for specs to have typos and errors in them, both in school and in industry. The usual thing to do is to just ask for clarification then move on with your day.

> Circuits are a pretty integral part of computers. why dont you think that would be a subject? Its in every CS book. Logic gates are at the base of every computer. how is that not relevant? 

Well, a computer science degree isn't really about computers. Rather, a computer science degree is about _computation_. You don't need computers to study the mathematics of computation. Most computer science degrees _will_ have courses on the pragmatics of how computers work, but a full overview of circuits is usually reserved for EE or Computer Engineering majors.

That said, logic gates _are_ fundamental in many ways/intersect nicely with propositional logic, and so it's not surprising that to me that you're covering basic circuits.";;
"yeah its a typo.  a pretty serious one. He expects a super high standard from us, but then im not allowed to challenge his standards to point out a lack of consistency is his teaching??

on the second part.. how is that ""my mistake?"" the person i responded to was mistaken.  They were the ones who said it wouldn't cover circuits, not me.  Computer Science is an umbrella.  an intro class is most certainly going to cover the hardware and the software aspects.
";;
"It looks like you replied before I finished making my edits -- if you take a second look at my comment, I've moderated my language (I was irritable for an unrelated reason, and so my tone came out harsher then I anticipated. Apologies).

In any case, regarding computer science and circuits -- I don't speak for /u/maestro2005, and am neither defending nor attacking his/her argument.

My main point is that in many computer science degrees, circuits are commonly _not_ taught as a part of the intro courses, which tend to focus more exclusively on programming. I would also disagree with your assertion that all intro classes are most certainly going to cover both hardware and software. In my experience, that usually isn't the case.

My other point is that it's highly unlikely for a computer science major to be taught extensively about circuits, electricity, and such -- the most interaction with circuits most CS majors have is with the concept of logic gates. Learning about the physics of how circuits work is usually one level of abstraction too far to be relevant to the theory of computation. 

Operating systems, computer architecture, and assembly is usually as low-level as most CS degrees will venture -- I don't think circuitry is as fundamental as you think (though logic gates may be).

That said, it's certainly possible that your school is offering a hybrid of computer science and computer engineering and labeling it as computer science, which which case it may be reasonable to study circuits/dive deeper.";;
"the program branches out after the first year. you choose a concentration, but every CS major has to take this class. there are classes on circuitry in the concentrations.

i think you are ignoring the fact that EVERY cs program at EVERY school is different";;
In a question on recursion on a test, I asked the professor about a question which was surprisingly easy. He said he made a mistake in the question and it was supposed to be harder but he let us answer it as it was. ;;
Well... if you are in a CS degree program you need to learn to figure things out for yourself honestly.  Is there a textbook for the course? Was there reading assigned? This is how college works.  Not everything you will be tested on will be covered in lectures, especially in summer courses.;;
"Yeah, you don't get it.  You probably either didn't go to school, had a decent/good program, or you had shitty teachers that you are excusing for some strange reason.

there is no reason to excuse bad teaching (i get it, you think im the problem. but, im not. as everyone thats taking the class can attest to..)";;
Well I'm a software engineer, and I can tell you that most of your learning should be focused on learning how to solve problems.  Any problem thrown your way is meant to be struggled through. I never said you were the problem. I merely tried to lead you to what helped me for my studies, which I struggled and had entire classes banding together to help each other.  We all made it through the struggles.  The professor's job is not to spoon feed you the answers.;;
hes supposed to feed us the method. that is what a TEACHER does.  im not asking for the answers. im asking for the tools to GET the answers.;;
Jesus, I don't think you understand what higher level (assuming this is 18+) education is about.  You are no longer spoon-fed the solutions anymore. That's the big change.;;
"Ive made it explicitly clear that i dont need the solutions, i need the METHOD to get the solutions.  It also goes by the name of ""Teaching."" -- this is my second degree, so i dont need a lecture on ""what education is about"" since you clearly dont know shit about the program im involved with

"He's supposed to teach you how to find the correct tools, not hand them to you. That's part of being a CS or CE. Usually the assignments are explained thoroughly in the text books, alternatively use Google.

So you can justify being pissed off.  I'm not saying you're outright lying, just exaggerating and misrepresenting things.

It would be, but not in an intro programming class.

There are about 30 CS books within 10 feet of where I'm currently sitting.  Not one of them mentions logic gates.  More exaggerations.

You're throwing a tantrum about a very simple typo.  Seems like you understand the gist of the problem and what constitutes valid input.  Why is this such a problem?  Oh right, anything that lets you be pissed off.

I've had really bad CS teachers too and I bitched but then I became a tutor and realized how much people don't actually give a fuck, after years of it I'm sure it affects your teaching ability.

i wasn't looking to be challenged.  I'm pointing out a very obvious flaw in my schools program. and if you see, MANY people are sharing their own stories.

The lack of competence for a professor doesn't mean a student should be complacent.";;
"My prof in calc 1 flunked people's assignments if they didn't get certain questions right, and only he knew which questions mattered.

Higher education in sciences is supposed to fuck you over and make you feel stupid and inadequate. That's how they force you to become a scientist with the right attitude. Only 1/3 graduate CE in my country, only 20% finish in 3 years. Shit's hard.

I'm pretty self-motivated to constantly study on my own. its all I do. so its not like im ""slacking"" on the studying part.  I just wish the program would match up more with the experiences i've had from MOOC's and just reading books.  there is something so ineffective about a teacher that just wings it and doesn't seem to have anyone keeping them in check.  if his lectures were posted to youtube, they'd be riddled with mean comments and downvotes";;
#3 isn't wrong. It's just not what you were expecting. Maybe it's not what he meant. But having the program say something when the input is <0 isn't wrong, it's just not comprehensive. But maybe there is a reason for that. Maybe he was trying to test YOUR attention to that detail. ;;

(For the record, it was stuff I vaguely already knew: sets, math notation, etc. Honestly, I don't remember what he taught besides a bit of truth tables, sets and math notation)

2. My networking instructor hired a TA who ended up yelling at his every chance he could. He would also grade our papers insanely harshly. Partly it was fine considering it was senior-only class but he was just an ass about it. The instructor fired the TA during our final project when the TA was continually berating us. 

3. My intro to programming instructor was into super into cows (all of his examples were about cows) and the lab instructor made all of the labs about food (She said she did it on purpose because it was at noon). Not a horror story but funny

A has to be greater than 0. but then he says ""tell the user it can't be a number less than 0""

If you graduate with a degree in music, or computer science, but you have no skills.. then your degree means nothing.

My favorite classes were ones that forced me to learn how to learn the subject matter on my own with my peers.  We had instructors who spoke theoretically and in generics until we were unable to bare the sound of their voice.  That did not deter my peers who were successful and completed the degree.

i could go to college and get a degree which will arbitrarily allow me to get access to better job opportunities, and STILL bust my ass off like i would've if I just worked on my own.

I'm TOTALLY fine with going on my own and dropping out of school.  As with music, you don't need a CS degree to be successful. You need skills.  I ran a successful teaching business for years.  Nothing that school could've taught me.

its almost like they dont teach a single business class in some of these CS courses.";;
"My worst experience after my first year was just having a professor who was completely unrealistic in his expectations for his students. A professor should absolutely push his students, but when homework cannot be completed unless you go to office hours and the TAs, who are grad students, still can't figure it out, it's probably too difficult. Average quiz grades were a D, while the second professor who designed the class and wrote the book had at least a B. 

I love my school and major, but that really made me quite bitter. The professor is also my mentor, so I have to go talk to him once a year to talk about what I should do with my major. ";;
"At my school, CS101 is taught in Scheme (a Lisp derivative). This year, one of our (notoriously bad) tenured professors decided halfway through the semester to stop teaching his 101 class Scheme and switch to Python. If the class wasn't already confused enough, he also decided that lectures were an ineffective teaching method and started handing out packets each class period and saying ""read this, and talk to me if you have any questions"". He would then spend the class on his laptop doing other things, and no one asked him questions because they were all too confused and annoyed to want to. 

I coached a friend through the class before tests and major projects, but in the end I doubt she could even write fizzbuzz on her own, and I don't blame her for it. ";;

"My worst experience with a CS teacher was in a C++ programming course, literally the entire course consisted of a single assignment: writing a date calendar. 

Then I took his advanced C++ course thinking it would be more varied...

You guessed it, we programmed and reprogrammed a fucking date calendar for the entire semester.

He wasn't a *bad* teacher, but dude, would it kill ya to have some variety?";;
"Worst was probably the guy who gave us tests like he was teaching history. ""Name the programming language that was released in X year and was developed by Y."" He only mentioned those random facts in passing during class, while he spent most of the time actually teaching useful things. So all in all not that terrible, just a little annoying.";;
I had an Indian professor that you could not understand. The professor that was supposed to teach the class had other classes to teach at that time. The prof would put up power point slides that had nothing to do with the class (software engineering), do a whole lecture that no one could understand, and then do pop quizzes that everyone failed. Everyone in the class ended up complaining how bad that class was to the professor that was actually supposed to teach it. ;;
From the CS courses I've taken, this seems to be representative of the culture. I'm a junior in the EE/CompE department of my university. You're complaints are valid, but I don't see things changing anytime soon. The thing is there are A LOT of resources available online and you're gonna need to learn to use them effectively if you want to be successful in this field. Collaboration with your peers is also crucial. Many of the professors are out of touch with their students, or spent much of their younger years tearing their own hair out trying to learn this stuff. The latter group wants to make your experience as challenging as theirs was even if it isn't necessarily the most productive approach. Take it as a challenge and you'll come out a better person and a smarter student. Or you can find another professor who is actually a good teacher (which I have found to be rare).;;
Intro to C++ my second year. Teacher walks into class, opens the book to page one, and reads verbatim the first chapter. Assigned the questions at the end of the first chapter for homework and then ends the class. I figure maybe he was assigned the class late and wasnt prepared. So I do the homework, come in the next day, same thing. Walks in, collected homework, read the chapter, assigned the chapter questions. Went to the third class, got my assignment back from the first class. Gave me a failing grade because it didn't match the answer in it book. At this point I should explain that I started coding in C at the age of 13, so I might have went a little crazy, like adding colors to the console, ASCII menus, etc. Just had fun with it. But the code compiled, ran, and met the requirements of the question. Anyhow, I took the assignment to the department head, explained what was going on. He told me that this guy was the only person they had to teach the class this semester, so I just had to deal with it. Dropped all my classes the next day. Never finished school, and it took me nearly 6 years to land my first professional development job, but I still did luckily.;;
If you're truly upset about the performance of your instructors then you can always send a complaint to the board or head of the department. It's their job to make sure everyone is doing their job well. However, there is always a great deal of politics in any office, so all efforts could be wasted. But you could still try to improve the situation for yourself or others in the future. ;;
"im content to just send an anonymous note to the department, or one with my name to it,a fter ive finished his classes.  -- at this point, im just going to pass his classes. not trying to raise a stink in the middle of the semester.  shoot, he might retire by the time i graduate, hes an old guy.

its more about ""how much do i care about next years intro students?""";;
Yeah exactly. It might not do anything for you now, especially if you just wait until you're done with the course, but it's more about improving other students' experiences now. You're doing it for the greater good! I was in a few similar situations, so I know the feeling. Good for you for wanting to do something about it, I'm sure there are many who've considered it but haven't followed through. ;;
"I failed a structured programming class I had because the professor couldn't speak English very well. He was very knowledgeable about the appropriate material, but I could never really get an understandable answer when I asked a follow-up question about something I didn't quite get.

The entire class had this problem, nearly everyone would have failed the midterm if it wasn't for it being marked on a curve. My mark had been bumped from 76% to 92%, however I still didn't manage to know enough for the final. It might have been my fault, but it was still a pretty painful class to go through. It was once a week, and 4 hours long. One week had been cancelled due to snow, and the lecture that would have been for that week was taught the next week, with next weeks lecture at the same time. There was just too much information to learn in too little time without much help.

I kept the textbook so I can learn the content myself before taking it again, so hopefully I won't have the same problem next time.";;
"My last semester of CS 102 was a grind. My Professor gave us homework that he made instead of using the book, and was rarely available to answer questions about the work. He told us to do things we never went  over in class as homeowrk, such as adding elements to a link list backwards, and then got mad when the class didn't know what to do. He also didn't explain recursion, he just told us to do it. 

Worst of all, he didn't really lecture or explain concepts in the book. The class time consisted of us getting Java programs, and then us copying the Java program from paper to the PC. Was really weird, and a waste of class discussion.

All in all, it was a very frustrating semester, and the Professor was pretty outlandish, but I like the class and him. I liked him not so much for his teaching style, but more so for knowing the subject well and giving us liberal example programs. Ended up getting a B+ in the class, which was the only non A that semester; missed a 4.0. One thing I learned from that semester is reading course material well, and supplementing information. I had to be a Professor and a student. 

RIP to my other classmates. I talked to four that said they were failing after the midterm, and according to the monstrous curves he gave the class not a lot of people did well.

"My ""horror stories"" are:

My c++ professor always worded his questions as confusingly as possible, so that I would spend sometimes 2 hours trying to figure out what he wanted me to do.

It was so bad that I gave up and flunked his class the first go round. Only class I ever flunked in my life.

Second time I took it online. Same teacher, but being able to go over and over his assignments and video lectures enabled me to figure out what he wanted.

My networking teacher was really really nice, but a BORING lecturer. No matter how well rested I was I kept falling asleep in her class. She tried to tell jokes sometimes but she just wasn't funny.

Not too bad, really.";;
"CS1 Teacher here.

No doubt you really have had some bad experiences.  I can't defend bad teachers, but I can explain a little bit if you want to hear it.

First, research universities are not really set up for teaching.  In a top school, professors are hired and promoted entirely on research.  Teaching is not normally their highest priority, and this is made very clear to them.  If you don't get a major grant in the first few years, your career as a professor is over.  Nobody gets tenure on teaching.  

Further, I've never seen teaching ability come up as a major factor when hiring new professors or even evaluating graduate students.

So naturally what happens is a number of things.  

* professors teach classes that they don't want to teach
* professors make their grad students (who are often less qualified)
* The class is taught by lecturers or adjuncts

There are some very talented CS teachers out there, but there are strong disincentives for them to stay.  

Without a PhD, you can focus on teaching, but you will never rise through the ranks, and it's honestly hard to make anything like the living you deserve as a 'good' CS teacher.

I can earn about as much in a week building an app as I do in an entire semester teaching an app development class.  And at the end of the semester, I've just produced another couple dozen competitors for my app business.

I joke about it, but it's kind of true.  Just about the only way to NOT make a decent living with CS skills is to teach them to others.

After helping hundreds of students get through college I may have to give up teaching so  I can afford to send my own kids to college

I still do it because I love it.  Teaching CS and programming is what I was born to do.  But the university structure is not designed to attract and reinforce high quality teaching.";;
"My biggest horror story is based around the government trying to profit from education. Costs keep skyrocketing and school funding keeps declining.  Teachers want to make a raise here and there (who doesn't?) and sometimes their only option is to head to private collages.

"on the costs thing: im taking a calculus class and we have a pretty bad graduate student teaching the class.  She doesn't really teach, just kinda regurgitates. but thats ok, because the entire class is tested/quizzed on this computer system.  so while the teacher is bad, the software is actually pretty thorough so you can get all the help and reading you need within the software.

so i crunched the numbers on how much each class ""costs"" based on tuition. then you imagine that every kid in the class is paying 50+ dollars a class for this calculus class that is taught by a bad teacher.

so the school is literally pulling in 1000+ dollars a class, but they only can afford to hire a TA who doesn't know the  material.  ";;
"I had an ""Operating Systems and Language Translators"" (read: compiler) module. It was a fucking mess. I've done some very low level programming before at the bare metal level and have a lot of interest in operating system development, among other things. All they taught was pretty inadequate and thin on the ground material, even for a beginner level it was like ""huh"". It was not at all even at an intermediate level it should have been. I've learnt more just reading through source code and booting my own code.

Anyway, the ""compilers"" part was a fucking *joke*. It went roughly like this:

 * This is a language
 * A parser is used to parse it and do something with it
 * This is AST, LL(R) and BNF - Hmm okay, totally skipped over most of the basics on this and me and the rest of the class was incredibly confused.
 * This is some useless tool (I don't even remember the name, one of the many UNIX tools for making grammars or something)
 * Okay now you've had a couple of lessons go make a language that compiles to C and then compile and run the C to prove it works

WTF. Bearing in mind not even a few months earlier it was all ""This is a class"" ""this is an if statement"" lessons, what the hell? Granted not everyone was this unknowledgeable about programming but either way, it was such a ridiculous assignment. Getting a mixture of people who can't program and people who have done some programming to make *a whole god damn programming language* when the documentation was non-existent and we'd literally had a couple of lessons on BNF and all this other stuff.

Never again.";;
"I'm guessing you're in your first year of college? Your professor isn't there to feed you anything, and probably doesn't give a shit if you learn the material. College is all about self-study and going beyond the class work.

I tell you that the hard way as someone who nearly failed out my first year, got better, but eventually switched majors and dropped out after several years, two majors, and two schools.

And IIRC, Circuit Analysis was part of my first year curriculum along with programming and math. So it's not surprising it would be assumed you'd have some understanding of logic gates and circuit structure if that's still the case or is common at most schools.

"> the limit is set up in such a way that the loop will NEVER START because i = 0, the while part assumes i > 0.

Wrong.  The conditional part of a for loop doesn't execute the first time through.  Here's an exercise I'll leave for you though:  In Java, `for (int i = 0; i > 0; ++i)` will terminate.  Why?";;
"++i increments and returns the incremented value. if it was i++ it wouldn't return the incremented value, until the next time through the loop

?

i think i might have actually written the sign down backwards, i wasn't able to copy it down before he changed it so im goin on memory. there were a few issues he had to fix -- -- 
""for (i == 0; i <= 0; i++) ;  would be an infinite loop""

he eventually realized it was supposed to increment down, not up.";;
"For the example maestro posted, it will terminate as the condition i>0 will never be true.  

for(i = 0; i <= 0; i++) will do one iteration.

The i++ vs ++i is almost irrelevant unless you then read it in the same sequence point (Talking C language here.)

As the third part of the for loop is its own sequence point, and no read is made, you can use either i++ or ++i as they're equivalent.

If you do Array[i++] = x then i++ or ++i is very important, as the resultant value is then used in the same sequence point.

i = i++ is undefined in C.

"I had a professor that would lecture us on ""life stuff"" more than the actual course content. She was really unorganized and behind on the schedule. I felt very rushed and didn't learn much during the lecture. I learned more during the lab, which was taught by a TA. 

One time I arrived to class late. I sat down and my classmate told me to turn my assignment in at the front desk. I do it, and my professor stops talking mid-lecture and just stares at me. I just laughed in my head.

"Had a professor who was just plain awful. He would not answer his emails, had no power point slideshows (I know it's not mandatory, but every other professor did), had no website, nor any form of communication. He had a really bad Asian accent, and was awfully difficult to understand, and not just that, but like yours, his tests were riddled typos and whatnot. 

Since we only got the homework at the end of class and it was due next, and that he never answered his email (and I had class during his office hours), I ended up failing them. I knew the material too, but his questions were obscure as all hell, misleading with as to what he wanted, etc.

For instance, he asked us to create a function which took a number and an exponent, and if the exponent was negative, to recursively return the non-negative of it. So...

exponent(2, -2)

Would become

exponent(1/2, 2)

I still don't know what precisely he wanted, because everyone got it wrong. Had the base case and recursive part perfect. Plus it was on paper too, so I dunno what he wanted.

Anyway, when I asked him what I should study for, what pages in the book we should read, etc. He said ""You don't need the book if you pay attention and take notes in class"". I honestly tried to get hold of him via email (and I had more important classes during his office hours), and even asked him for what pages in the book we had to read. I dropped it in time thankfully, and I'll never take that professor again.";;
"To be honest it feels like you're trying to troll this sub.

1. getting a circuit question and not covering any circuits i get is a big deal. But thinking from a prof's standpoint, this is a summer course therefore it must be fast paced. maybe he teaches it during the regular school period and has time to cover it and just forgot he never covered that part of the curriculum. Prof's have lives too, and sometimes they get lazy with the curriculum
also, if there was a question on an exam that wasnt covered and when you confronted the prof he didnt say he was mistaken/should not have been asked, then that is a pretty good indication that he wants you to know that stuff. AKA learn that stuff since you didnt learn it for the first exam. Then if he announces another quiz without stating what will be on it, review the topics you dont know well(so circuits for the whole class)

2. im sorry but its not that big of a jump from simple math to the fib sequence. f0=0, f1=1 fn=fn-1 + fn-2. Now if you had to solve this with matricies i can see how that would be hard to cover and cover in such a short time (but again summer course so time is short), but even still its a pretty basic problem for an intro course.

3. said before in this thread, but there is nothing wrong with this. just because not all cases are outlined in the prompt does not make the prompt wrong; it allows for individuality and different interpretations for the problem. Also its not too hard to write a comment at the top of your program stating the assumptions you took before answering.

after reading through some of these responses on this thread it seems you are a bit stubborn. Take the responses on here with a grain of salt, im sure some of the people responding have gone through greater hardships and have much more experience.
Also, this is an intro to cs class, not an intro to java course. They are teaching you the basics of cs, not java so just because you have been using Java for 2 years doesnt mean you have been experiencing all the different aspects of CS. There is a reason that other languages are used rather than just java

HE SKIPPED LOOPS.  he skipped conditional statements.  just went from variables to ""do the fibonacci"" - everyone who is arguing that it is intentionally hard is missing the point that he IS teaching things. just not in a coherent fashion

In my experience, college was the wrong place for me to learn I.T. because it was like working on several different things, one hour each per day, which is like watching ten minutes of a movie per week where you're supposed to remember the plot three months hence.

"Haha... What college/uni still teaches intro to cs classes in Java?

Everyone has had their fair share of terrible professors/TAs in college/uni. I think that intro classes can be particularly bad too. Mostly because the professors/TAs might think they're above the material.

This is a great reason to talk to friends who have taken cs courses (or any courses for that matter) and/or an advisor to figure out who are the better teachers... And to figure out what electives have the best teachers (for next semester/quarter and the future).

huh my school teaches C++ through about 4 terms startign with basics all the way to OOP. No IDE allowed and you must learn how to use the linux terminal as well as debugging through GDB.

Eh, idk about that -- Python and Java are pretty much tied for the the position as the top teaching language (Python is in first place, Java trails a close second). Here's a list of the top ~50 universities in the US, and what languages they teach:

Nice link! I wasn't wrong though... I think more schools will go to Python (I know Tufts even teaches JS O.O). Academia moves slow. I think I would switch schools if I had to learn MATLAB in an intro to cs series (unless I was studying MechE, ChemE, or any of those physical engineering fields).;;
Yes Python or C, or C++ should be the first language. NOT Java.;;
Java doesn't need an IDE. It can be compiled and run on the command line.;;
Yes... I know it can. I'm just saying, in my opinion and experience, that's usually not how people write and compile java.;;
My own experience and opinion disagree.;;
All of my classes were Java-based minus the 4th year stuff.  It's a great language to learn on because of the sandboxed environment and how difficult it is to shoot yourself in the foot. Not to mention static typing and compile-time error-checking.;;
But... that's the really cool part about C. It allows you to do basically anything (and screw up basically everything). Also no interpreted language will allow you to really shoot you in the foot either.;;

ESXi gives you more options as far as networking goes.  

With that aside, since you already use VMware, you could certainly set up an Apache (or anything else you'd like) web server and get your site set up on there. This should work fine on Windows or Linux. You'll want to give your VM a static IP address (don't use NAT or anything like that). You'll need to use some sort of dynamic DNS service to update the DNS records out on the internet whenever your home IP Address changes (which it probably does a couple of times per day or week).  

Finally, you'll need to set up a NAT on your router/firewall to translate external IP/Port to internal IP/Port. For example, when someone sends a request to your external IP Address at a certain port, your router/firewall will need a NAT to tell it where to send that request (your VM).

Actually, all your variable shouldn't be in quotes. Having anything in quotes means its a string, so when you do ""age"" < 13, that'll be false because age is a string, and you can't do a comparison with a string to the number 13.

"Glad you got it figured out. 

Before you go further, you should try and understand the fundamental difference between variables, numbers, booleans, strings etc. 

So numbers, booleans and strings are all basic types. That is they exist in their simplest form. A number is always just the number by itself, no quotes, nothing else. Eg: 4. A boolean is either true or false. Those are the only two boolean values (it can get confusing here since some things can equate to a boolean. That is an expression, once evaluated is equal to, or is simplified down to a boolean, Eg: 4 > 3. This is always true, and you can consider it almost as simplifying it and instead of 4 > 3, you could just write true. That is 4 > 3 = true).

There are other types, but I won't go into them.

Now you have variables. There is a popular way of describing variables as pointers to things, but that is actually how it works, and perhaps a bit too complicated just now. To understand the basic concept, think of a variable as a box. 

    var myVariable = 4; 

Okay so here I have created a box called `myVariable`. In that box I've put the number 4 in it. Next time I try and use `myVariable` it will be 4. So I could do something like this;

    console.log(myVariable + 3);
    -> 7
    typeof myVariable;
    -> ""number""

Lets try another one;

    var myStringVariable = ""some string"";

Now in this box is a string. I would still access whats in that box by using `myStringVariable`, thats the name of the box. Notice we don't have quotes around the names of variables/boxes. The string is in the box.

    console.log(myStringVariable + "" appended"");
    -> ""some string appended""

    // see here the string was concatenated (joined together)

    typeof myStringVariable;
    -> ""string""

Note how this box holds a string, and thus the type of it is a string.




So what are the following types? 

1) 4 -> number

2) ""hello"" -> string

3) ""Hello 3 times!"" -> string

4) ""3 times"" -> string // just because we have a number character in our string doesn't change the fact its a string. It has quotes, its a string! 

5) ""3"" -> string // again, it has quotes, its a string, and has a number character in it

6) true -> boolean

7) 4 > 39 -> boolean


Now this is all relatively basic stuff, and one of the problems with JS is that as you start using it more and more, you will find weird and odd things happen when you are using different types of things in one expression. I can't go through a list of the odd behaviours but just expect it. Sometimes something won't work and it just won't make sense. Then you'll have to rely on your google-fu and you'll start leaning about the weird things!

I'm really not sure, DOWHILE is very confusing for me and I've been fine for the past 3 weeks until now. This fibonacci series is really throwing me off since it wants me to use it's formula and stop at the first number greater than 100. I honestly have no idea how I'd go about writing that";;
"Alright, well let's start at the top.

    a=0 b=1

that's good. Then you say you want to display a and b. But according to your problem, you only need to display a number that's greater then 100.

Let's concentrate on this problem statement: ""output the first number greater than 100 in the preceding series""

The preceding series is the Fibonacci series, where the next number is the sum of two previous numbers. So we need to output the number that is the sum of two previous numbers and this number must be greater then 100. Let's imagine pseudo code wihout the Do WHILE stuff first.

    a is 0
    b is 1
    nextValue is the sum of the previous two, or nextValue is a + b
    if nextValue is greater than 100 display nextValue
    now select the last two values, which is b and nextValue
    nextValue is the sum of the previous two, or nextValue is b + nextValue
    if nextValue is greater than 100 display nextValue
    now select the last two values, which is the previous nextValue and the current nextValue
    nextValue is the sum of the previous two
    if nextValue is greater than 100 display nextValue

"The Fibonacci Sequence is a very simple loop. 

* a = 0
* b = 1
* c = a + b
* d = b + c
* e = c + d

and so on.  Since you are continuously doing the same thing, (next value = previous two values), that's why you are doing the DOWHILE loop.

The code would be something along the lines of:

    a = 0
    b = 1
    print a
    print b
    DOWHILE c < 100
        c = a + b
        print c
        a = b //Shifts 2nd value into 1st place
        b = c //Shifts result to 2nd place
    ENDLOOP


Your resulting printout would be:

    0 (print a)
    1 (print b)
    1 (print c, a = 1 (from b), b = 1 (from c), loop)    
    2 (print c, a = 1 (from b), b = 2 (from c), loop)
    3 (print c, a = 2 (from b), b = 3 (from c), loop)

and so on until you reach 100.

EDIT:::  I misread your original post and see that the problem wants you to return the first number greater than 100.  My above psuedocode will print out all the Fib numbers from 0 through less than 100.  I'm leaving it so you can learn from it, but /u/Hexorg has answered the question correctly.";;
"in (4) you haven't created nextValue yet. Ok, here's the pseudocode for your problem. See if you understand it. Notice how I'm propagating the sum by swapping a and b, and assigning sum to b. That way, 'a' always holds second to last value, and 'b' holds the last value. 

    a = 0
    b = 1
    while (a+b) < 100 do
       sum = a + b
       a = b
       b = sum

"That's what the while function is doing.

WHILE test < value DO
as long as ""test"" < ""value"" is a TRUE statement, the loop will function. Once it stops being a true statement, the code inside the loop will not run.

0	1	1	2	3	5	8	13	21	34	55	89	144



Once a = 55 and b = 89, a+b = 144.  Since 144 < 100 would return FALSE, the code would skip to the ""done"" remark and continue from there.";;

"Ok, so you have to write a pseudo code algorithm that prints the first Fibonacci number greater than 100 AND your algorithm must use a DOWHILE loop.

You can see that you are going to have to generate a number using a loop and see if it meets the correct conditions and either continue the loop or print, depending on whether it passes or fails. You know you have to use a DOWHILE and you know you have to compare your output to the desired conditions, ergo, the ""while"" in your loop should cause it to repeat if ""the Fibonacci number I've reached is less than 100"". In order for the value you print to be the *first* number greater than 100 you must compute and test each Fibonacci number using your loop. Since you can't calculate the first two numbers in the sequence you know you'll have to declare them. You know that A=0 and B=1, and now you can start computing Fibonacci numbers in your loop, each time testing ""is A+B less than 100?""";;
"First off, I'm doing this in c++ because I feel its the easiest to parse out and tell whats going on.  
That being said,
Let's start this problem with first figuring out how to find/make the fibonacci numbers: Since we know how the series is equated and the first two values of the series we can say that  
a=0  
b=1  
nextval = a+b  

So, now with this information we can create a loop to make the fibonacci series:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
do   
{  
nextval = a+b;  
a=b;  
b=nextval;  
if(nextval>=100)  
{  
cout << nextval;  
}  
  
}while(nextval<100)  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
Doing this with a do-while loop will make sure that everything is evaluated at least once, and will only continue through another sequence if nextval is less than 100. Notice that we have the if-statement to output text at the bottom of the loop, this is done so that if nextval is greater than 100 for the current iteration of the loop it will be output before the while statement is read and the sequence terminates. If we put it at the top of the statement, we would be left with the fibonacci number that was directly before the first one greater than 100. ";;

"> Yet I'm reading on forums that **C++ is no longer a worthwhile language to learn**, because it's too difficult (even though I don't think it's completely true) and full of useless stuff, as well as too low level and, then, barely portable and so on. Furthermore, it seems to be used in few areas, like game development etcetera. 

Opinions are like assholes. Everyone has one and most of them stink. If you enjoy C++ more than you enjoy Java by all means use C++: having fun while learning programming is more important than which language you use.";;
"Personally I feel they all have their pros and cons. C is great because it is a super lightweight language that can run on almost every OS and has the potential to be the most efficient language out of the bunch as well as the fact that its getting close to having a half-century of libraries written for it so chances are if you wanna do something there is a library for it.

C++ is strong because it is more powerful than C and just as efficient. I personally believe there is no reason to use C when you can use C++ as all the libraries transfer over. Some things cant run C++ while they can run C but thats one of the few downsides of it.

While using both of the above you have to be sure to structure your program before using them if you dont your project will quickly go to shit.

Java is strong because it can run anywhere. While it is not such a good client side choice anymore with the security issues and their being more efficient client side universal languages e.g. Javascript. It is super strong in a server side aspect because of its scaleability and power as well as being able to run anywhere you put it.

Mh, I think you're right. And, since I would also like to learn more about algorithms and data structures, what language among those 3 do you think would be better? For example, R. Sedgewick wrote 3 books: Algorithms in C, C++ and Java. I could take advantage of it for deepening both algorithms and a programming language. For some reason, though, I've the impression C is not so much suitable for learning data structures, because of its OOP lack.;;
"Ya, as I said I really don't see the need to ever use C if you can use C++ so I agree with you there. I personally think Java is better for a generalist to learn as you can make pretty much anything in Java, although it might not be efficient as C++. C++ is good to learn if you want to go into game design or a field where efficiency is really important. Its really up to you.

Edit: Forgot to mention that in general use Java for high-level computing concepts and C/C++ for lower-level ideas.";;
So you think that, after finishing K&R, I should deepen my Java knowledge in order to set off against the C one, so that I can have both a low and high level understanding and covering many fields as well, and then, maybe, studying C++ which is used in more ristrict fields, if required?;;

As I said replying to rjcarr, I think I'll take Computer Engineering at university, therefore maybe I'll work with something like embedded systems, AI, robotics, image processing, high performance computing, enterprise information systems and so on.;;
C++ is probably the way to go since your most likely going to be working with lower level concepts. That said if you have never worked with Java before I highly recommend you get a good understanding of it. But given your goals C++ would be the most useful to learn.;;
Actually I've studied with Java concepts like OOP, generics, up-downcasting, runtime type identification, GUI, File I/O, exceptions and so on, in other words, I think, I may have a sufficient Java knowledge.;;

All right! Would you suggest me to buy an algorithm book like Algorithms in C++ by Sedgewick, or rather a C++ reference book like C++ Primer or Stroustrup's?;;
If you want to learn data structures, I would recommend C or C++. Implement a linked list, map, vector etc;;
Already done, in Java. Yet I think, like you, that it would be better in C++, since, e.g., you actually link the nodes by *explicit* pointers. This is why I think it'd be better to learn data structures in some low level language, maybe C++, since C is classless.;;

Those issues are irrelevant to applications, only to sandbox for browser applets. It has no relation to rest of the Java platform. On top of that unsigned applets cannot be run anymore. This argument is invalid, and was invalid for years. Repeating it over and over is stupid.

If we talk about real security, Java is gazillion times safer language than C or C++, because memory corruption is practically impossible in Java.

Quick note: C is more efficient than C++,  especially if you're considering program size. C++ has much more overhead ;;
In what way? Besides program size itself. ;;
Program size is important. The execution time of a c program will be faster than the c++ equivalent ;;
"Program size can be important. It's not like just having functions that are never called in your executable automatically makes it slower. Maybe slower to load into memory, but if that's your bottleneck, then you're in a really good place. 

Obviously if you're doing embedded stuff, you have to start worrying about executable size, but can you give some examples in desktop performance where you've actually measured a noticeable difference?";;
"I didn't say that you would notice a difference. My point was that C and C++ are not equally efficient. By that logic you could argue that Java and C are equal in speed,  because for most practical purposes you wouldn't notice a difference. 

I've never personally tested it myself,  but I do know that C++ makes a bigger executable, and larger executables take longer to run";;
"I mean, again, efficiency is somewhat overblown here. C++ does generate larger executables, but it's typically because you're using features C literally doesn't have. You'd have to write versions of them for yourself, which may or may not be faster, and may or may not bloat your code size above and beyond what C++ does by default.

Examples: 

1. Exceptions - Enabling and using exceptions can and will make your program size larger. Nowadays simply enabling and using exceptions doesn't actually slow your code down by very much, likely it will barely even be noticeable. However that exceptional path is very slow, as they cache it far away in the executable space, so as to speed up the general case. Finding where it is isn't the problem, the problem is that the exceptional code page likely isn't in your cache, and you're going to have to go out to main memory.

2. Run-time Type Information/Virtual: These features will cause some bloat. Every virtual call, or dynamic_cast now needs to take a cache miss, as well as simply more code to go to get the function pointer/type.

I could speculate at more, as I'm sure there are, but these are the ones I know for sure and are at the top of my head.

Also I'd like to point out that Java and C aren't really comparable by either of our arguments. Java doesn't have to do much of anything when compiling compared to C or C++. Java and C are just incredibly different between their ""executables"". As for my argument, I'm not really sure what I was arguing that would be transferable to Java. The fact is that I can actually just write the subset of C that works in both C and C++ and compile it with either compiler and look at the difference if I wanted to. Actually see where they diverge.

As for a small example (I don't have anything moderately sized written in C that I can port to linux for testing.), I've compiled this project statically on clang and clang++: https://github.com/playmer/delayio

And I've found a difference of 54 bytes. Disabling exceptions and RTTI doesn't seem to do anything, which isn't surprising, but I am curious where those bytes are coming from. I don't care to look at the asm at the moment as I'm doing this testing through a terminal to a server I host my website on but I'd be curious to look into that.

Also I want to be clear that I'm not really directing all of this at you, but for the general audience. I know you may be aware of these things, but for people who don't know C++ as well as you or I (And I wouldn't ever come close to saying I know C++ well.) simply saying C++ is more or less efficient isn't really giving the reader any useful or actionable information.

edit: Someone suggested I actually name the files with cpp rather than c. Clang did report to me that something funky was going down, but the warning wasn't particularly helpful. Either way, the difference is still only 54 bytes. (Initially I had said 50)";;
"Indeed, when I started programming, I suddenly noticed how the same program in C++ was much bigger than the C one. By the way, I would like to understand two things:

- What kinds of programs could make us notice a sufficient performance difference between C and C++, so that one had better use C?

- I've noticed Java is *way* slower than C/C++. An example is minecraft. Hence, how come some people assert Java can be as fast as C++? Also because I think it's virtually impossible, since bytecode needs to be interpreted at run-time, whereas C++ programs are compiled in machine code.";;
Did you actually rename the files to .cpp?  Otherwise, clang++ will compile them as C and the only difference is going to be at link-time.;;
"The warning for that was not clear, I had not initially done that because it seemed as though it was going to compile it as C++ despite it being deprecated behavior.

Regardless, it added only 4 bytes to my previous findings.";;
"The only place where I are interested in the program's size is when programming for embedded systems (systems with small amount of memory). 

An overhead that C++ has is the virtual table when using inheritance. But that is just one or two levels of indirection, only affecting runtime by a marginal amount. ";;
"Seems you're already pretty far along so it really is about preference and what you intend to do with your career.  If you intend to go into game development or (certain) sciences then I'd stick with C++.  If you plan on doing higher level stuff then go with Java.

I'd say if you're comfortable with C++, and everything else being equal, I'd stick with it.  I feel it is a superset of java, i.e., anything that is necessary learning in java could be learned as a variation in C++, but the opposite isn't true.";;
Well, I think that, after high school, I'll take an undergraduate course in Computer Engineering, so I think I'll end up working with stuff like embedded systems and robotics, but I'd also like not to limit myself to these two fields, but rather being capable of doing something else as well, having a general preparation which can be used for many fields involving programming, like server programming and so on. ;;
let's bring C# into this, thoughts on it vs C++?;;
I kind of regard it as a secondary language, maybe 'cause it looks like a Java/C++ mix usable only on Windows, even though it seems required for an high percent of jobs. What jobs do you think I should learn C# for?;;
The Windows-orientedness of it is a pity (though Mono isn't all bad), but as a language C# is basically an improved version of Java.  (Just like Java, it hasn't got much in common with C++.);;
">C++ is no longer a worthwhile language to learn, because it's too difficult (even though I don't think it's completely true) and full of useless stuff, as well as too low level and, then, barely portable and so on.

Too low level, hence barely portable. Yeah that's why major OSs' are written in Java rather than C/C++. right?

The portability that Java promises isn't true cross platform portability. It still requires a full fledged VM to run its code across different systems. Try running a java program inside that small chip that's working your AC or some other appliance. Or of you're talking about modern machines then you can be more productive with something like electron apps. But again I'm not here to argue about Java vs some other language but please keep your facts straight.

>Instead, Java is always more used and required, and its pros are simplicity, clarity (C++ code usually tends to look kind of cryptic) and portability, even though its cons (which can be pros for someone else) are above all the impossibility of using low level stuff like pointers and manual memory management, cons for which one couldn't realize what happens ""under the hood"" (even though I've already studied pointers, x-allocs, destructors, heap, stack and stuff like that).

I agree c++ code sometimes can look cryptic, but so can of Java. It somewhat depends on the programmer who is writing it. Java is great because of its support and long time stay. Some still say that it was a big mistake. And do not dismiss C# which is quiet a good language compared to these and is quiet cross-platform too- check out Xamarin.";;
">Try running a java program inside that small chip that's working your AC or some other appliance

You mean like the way Java runs on DVD players, blu Ray players, TVs, kiosks, printers, home appliances, web cams, smart cards, and cellular devices?

That statement is completely nonsensical.

You've taken one of Java's strengths and are suggesting the opposite.  There's more embedded Java on ""appliances"" and small footprint PCs and devices than anything else, probably by at least several orders of magnitude given the number of units produced in smart cards and phones alone.


>... Java vs some other language but please keep your facts straight.

Indeed.";;
"I know of the fact that java is used in embedded environment too. But I've seen far more such appliances that are either hardwired to do so, or have c running inside them in some way. I'm not dismissing the fact about java though.

Also I do not have sufficient knowledge, but how do things inside a DVD player and other appliance run java? Do they require a vm and is it installed as standalone isloated environment or on top of some other abstract code eg. some sort of small OS?";;
"I really like [RoboMongo](http://robomongo.org/). It works well and is easy to use.

"Just learned the basic not being properly all books are different focusing different subject. In my book it focused on basic tutorials such as how to enhance your page forms and use other languages such as Jquery and PHP.

"    console.log(""Great to see you, "" + name);
is correct :)";;
"I would write `console.log(""Great to see you, "" + name);`.  The code you linked looks like it was copied from a tutorial, and I'm guessing that the reason they wrote it that way was to demonstrate that you can add multiple strings together.";;
"Both are equivalent, but yours is ""better"" as it does one less string concatenation.  This is even better:

    console.log(""Great to see you,"", name);

As the `log` function prints all arguments passed to it without an initial string concatenation.

But really, all 3 are effectively the same.";;
So the comma outside the quotes won't show up in the console? ;;
Nope, give it a try!;;
"Correct, but it works slightly different than you may think. If you do

    console.log(""Great to see you, "" + name);

then you are passing 1 single argument to the console.log function. Precisely, you are explicitly taking ""Great to see you, "", and then concatenate whatever is in the name variable on to the end of it, and *then* passing that single string as one argument into the function.

However, if you do it like this:

    console.log(""Great to see you,"", name);

You are passing two separate strings into the console.log function, and then you are letting it do whatever it wants with them. The comma outside the quotes indicates to the function that you are separating two arguments. It just so happens that the console.log function is written in a way where it will take all the arguments and concatenate them together, with a space in between each.

The reason it is good to understand this distinction is because the first line of this below snippet is valid JavaScript, but the second is not:

    var x = ""a "" + ""b"";
    var y = ""a"", ""b"";";;
"""Unfamiliar""? Yes, everybody experiences it.
";;
I would call it familiarity (or rather, unfamiliarity), just like with spoken/written languages.  Kanji looks alien to people who have only learned to read and write English.  That doesn't mean it isn't possible to learn both, or that one is always better than the other, or that people who tell you to learn one or the other are wrong.;;
"Once you know C++ (or java, or C#, etc)  it doesn't take long to start understanding python.  They are all in the ""c style"" family, although python *is* a bit of an outlier with whitespace being significant.

I've been writing software for almost 20 years and I still have a hard time with the ""smalltalk style"" languages like smalltalk, ruby, and obj-c.  I haven't put much time into any of them, but at first glance my brain has a hard time figuring it out.

But just give it some time and it'll all become familiar.  All languages have their quirks and conventions you have to learn.";;

"You need to step back and start doing some basic stuff. I know most people probably read the title and decided to comment but you say you ""know how to get the data"" but don't know which language to use or how to make a UI.

"JSFiddle is for JS. Java is completely unrelated to JS. In the future, use something like Gist.

Firstly, because this is super important: **use accurate names**. `x` is a horrible name for something that should be `found` or similar.

Anyway, `union` does not return anything nor does it modify anything outside of the method. As a result, it effectively does nothing. Surely that's not what you wanted? I didn't check the rest, but it's probably the same error.";;
ah so do i use Set instead of void and return c? still gives me null for some reason.;;
"Post your code and the test suite.

EDIT: Your union is wrong. Recall that union simply joins two sets (without duplicates). Since your `addElement` should be checking if the element is already in the set (and doing nothing if it is), you can just add all the objects in each set.

Your code would *strongly* benefit from reusing what you've already written. There's a lot of places where you check if something contains an object. Don't reimplement that! You've already written `contain()` (which should be named ""contains"" to be more idiomatic). Use that.

EDIT2: I note that you're using `==` all over the place. This is almost certainly not what you want. You want to use `equals` so that classes that override `equals` will work correctly. As it stands, you could add `12345` to your set multiple times since what's being stored is objects of type `Integer` and they'll be different objects. Using `equals` will correctly identify that two `Integer`s have the same actual value.";;

I've been working with a small app company and we only have 2 engineers while we have 2 dedicated business people and a handful of business advisors it seems like it might be obsessive since the product is the biggest part right? no the structure of the company and how things run is super important if an app is gonna blow up because it doesn't happen over night.;;
"Welcome to the world of mobile app programming.  You aren't just a programmer, you are now a salesman as well.  

And no offense, but you need a lot of improvement in this realm.

"I wasn't saying you gave us a bad pitch, just that different apps have different target markets, different target markets require different marketing techniques, and that you gave us zero info on your app, so how are we supposed to help you get the word out to the audience you want to see it?

That said, now that we know your app is targeted toward the college crowd and is a social gathering app, the best way to grow it is to get college organizers to use it.  

The problem is if 1 out of 100 college kids download and use the app, that still isn't enough to have other people download it to find events to attend.  

So I would suggest convincing (either through a great sales pitch or just straight up paying) large college organizations that have regular meetings to use the app as their primary way to advertise their events.  They can use other methods as well, but they should be primarily be telling people to download your app to find the meetings.  

This also seems like a mobile version of meetup.com, that you can expand to a much wider audience than the college crowed.  Again the best way to get people to use the app is to get the organizers of events to use it as their primary way for attending people to find what is going on. ";;
That's some solid advice! That really is a good idea I should get in contact with some clubs and organizations that would love this. Thank you!

I would also like to recommend /r/Entrepreneur as another place to ask this question and get other answers because, at heart, you are asking a marketing question instead of a programming question. ";;
Just a heads up, you still have some Lorem ipsum text on the screenshots section of your website.;;
"This isn't easy. It's not really related to programming, though. The term you're looking for is marketing. You want to be able to market your app to raise awareness of it. Traditional ways to do so include advertising, reviews, and spread through word of mouth. It's also easy to fuck up and make everyone hate your app. I don't know enough about marketing to say anything concrete. All I can say is that it's not a programming issue, so out of the scope of this sub, so you'll probably want to look elsewhere to find qualified people to help.

Some apps have managed to take off with nothing more than word of mouth, but that takes a lot of luck.

Some people seem to have had some success in getting things going by finding a discussion where it's relevant to mention their app. You'll see this on StackOverflow, sometimes, where a user will ask for a particular tool and someone else will mention that they created such a tool. Probably best to do so with a mention that you're the creator and to avoid targeting such discussions, since nobody likes spam.";;
"I understand what you mean about this probably being the wrong sub, although this could be the right one too. I see it we are all people looking to learn how to code and more experienced programmers help, I'm adding some of them have been in this position and may have some advice.

"Mobile is full of dev's scrambling to be seen. Thousands of apps get uploaded every day. It's brutal. That's why large companies are using tv ads and putting hundreds of thousands of dollars into internet advertising. 

But you can still be seen by doing your own marketing. Talk to people directly who may be interested in your app. Leaving the link here isn't spam. your not going to get many downloads from it anyway but you may get some good advice. 

You have to be creative in how you raise awareness. It's brutal and is just as important as developing the actual app. Connect with bloggers, people online, people in real life. Generate traffic. maybe write a blog about your experience for other dev's. Provide stuff that is useful and use your app as the example.

If it's good and nobody uses it, well at least you can use it as an example of your work and maybe it will lead to some freelance jobs if you want that.

Mobile apps is a saturated marketplace and a lot of dev's have moved on to freelancing instead of trying to get their own apps seen.";;
"I'm afraid it's not very clear what you mean by ""create a spiral"". The ""7 8 9 6 1 2 5 4 3"" part doesn't really make anything clearer. You'll probably need a fuller example of what you want.";;

`1 2 3`

to this:

`7 8 9`

`6 1 2`

where 1 is [0, 0], 2 is [0, 1],...  9 is [2, 2]";;
"Ok, now that I know what you want, the simplest way to do this would be to merely hardcode it. Assuming that the example you gave is the only case, that would be the simplest approach. By ""hardcode"", I mean you do something like:

    Foo[][] newArray = new Foo[3][3];
    newArray[0][0] = oldArray[2][0];
    newArray[0][1] = oldArray[2][1];
    // ...

It looks like an unideal solution (and indeed it's not at all general), but there's nothing wrong with hardcoding things where it makes sense to (such as when we only need this case. The code will be simplier and faster.

But anyway, for a more general solution, let's look at the pattern:

	1 2 3    7 8 9
	4 5 6 -> 6 1 2
	7 8 9    5 4 3

	1  2  3  4      7  8  9  10
	5  6  7  8      6  1  2  11
	9  10 11 12 ->  5  4  3  12
	13 14 15 16     16 15 14 13

	21 22 23 24 25
	20 7  8  9  10
	19 6  1  2  11
	18 5  4  3  12
	17 16 15 14 13

You can do this kind of stuff on paper. It's easiest there. I'm assuming only square 2D arrays, since otherwise we'd have to deal with the fact that a perfect spiral won't fit. We'll worry about figuring out if this actually works for just any 2D array later.

Now, first thing I note is that the starting point seems to be at `[(row - 1) / 2][(col - 1) / 2]` (that's integer division, which always truncates, the equivalent of rounding down). Now that we know the starting point, the next point will be to the right one. Next thing I notice is that there's a pattern in how I move. So, from the starting point, here's how I move for the 5x5 array:

	1r
	1d
	2l
	2u
	3r
	3d
	4l
	4u
	4r

Notice how I increase how many times I go in a direction every time I change from going up or down? Perhaps this pattern will continue? Were I more cautious programmer, I'd try another matrix to see, but I'm not, so let's try and write some code to see if our presumptions are correct. So, first of all, let's make a function to create the non-spiralized array and a function to print the array out. Nothing special here. This will aid us in testing.

	public static int[][] create2dArray(int size) {
		int[][] array = new int[size][size];
		
		for(int row = 0; row < size; ++row) {
			for(int col = 0; col < size; ++col) {
				array[row][col] = (col + 1) + size * row;
			}
		}
		
		return array;
	}
	
	public static void print2dArray(int[][] array) {
		for(int[] row : array) {
			for(int element : row) {
				System.out.print(element + ""\t"");
			}
			System.out.println();
		}
	}

For example, output from `print2dArray(create2dArray(3))` is:

	1	2	3	
	4	5	6	
	7	8	9	

Ok, that looks right. Now for the hard part: the spiralization. We're going to use a `Point` to keep track of where we are in this spiral array (since we're moving around in kind of complex directions). As mentioned above, we know the starting point. We also know that we start by moving 1 step right. We know that if we're at the end of moving up or down, the total distance to move in the new direction increases (which means we must keep track of the total distance to move and how far we have moved). And of course, we know which way to change direction when we're at the end of a stepping in one direction.

We have to be very careful with our coordinates. Arrays do NOT use cartesian coordinates (which you're probably very used to). Rather, we start at the top, left corner and have positive offsets from there. The x coordinate is the *row* and the y coordinate is the *column* (opposite of cartesian!). Now, how do we get the values from the original array? This is fortunately quite simple since we're iterating through the original array in order. One neat trick is that if we have a single index for the 2D array, we can find the row and column with `[i / arraySize][i % arraySize]` (figuring out how this works is left as an exercise to the reader).

We now have everything we need to write our code:

	public static int[][] spiralizeArray(int[][] array) {
		int arraySize = array[0].length;
		int[][] spiralArray = new int[arraySize][arraySize];
		Point position = new Point((arraySize - 1) / 2, (arraySize - 1) / 2);
		Direction directionToMove = Direction.RIGHT;
		int distanceToMove = 1;
		int totalMovementInDirection = 1;
		
		for(int i = 0; i < arraySize * arraySize; ++i) {
			// Uncomment this line to see the position we're at in the spiral
			//System.out.println(""Spiral: ("" + position.x + "", "" + position.y + "")"");
			
			// Uncomment this line to see the position we're at in the original
			//System.out.println(""Original: ("" + (i / arraySize) + "", "" + (i % arraySize) + "")"");
			
			// Copy the ith value to the position placement
			spiralArray[position.x][position.y] = array[i / arraySize][i % arraySize];
			
			// We've exhausted a move in that direction
			--distanceToMove;
			
			// If we're changing from moving up or down, then the distance we move
			// will increase.
			if(distanceToMove == 0 && (directionToMove == Direction.UP ||
					directionToMove == Direction.DOWN)) {
				++totalMovementInDirection;
			}

			// Figure out which way to move in. While we're at it, figure out the
			// new direction if we've reached the end of where to move
			if(directionToMove == Direction.UP) {
				position.translate(-1, 0);
				if(distanceToMove == 0) directionToMove = Direction.RIGHT;
			}
			else if(directionToMove == Direction.DOWN) {
				position.translate(1, 0);
				if(distanceToMove == 0) directionToMove = Direction.LEFT;
			}
			else if(directionToMove == Direction.LEFT) {
				position.translate(0, -1);
				if(distanceToMove == 0) directionToMove = Direction.UP;
			}
			else {
				position.translate(0, 1);
				if(distanceToMove == 0) directionToMove = Direction.DOWN;
			}
			
			// And if we reached 0 distance to move, that gets reset
			if(distanceToMove == 0) {
				distanceToMove = totalMovementInDirection;
			}
		}
		
		return spiralArray;
	}

I've left two debug prints in there so that you can see the coordinates at each loop. Now to see if this is right:

	int[][] array = create2dArray(3);
	int[][] spiral = spiralizeArray(array);
		
	System.out.println(""ORIGINAL:"");
	print2dArray(array);

	System.out.println(""SPIRAL:"");
	print2dArray(spiral);

And the output is:

	ORIGINAL:
	1	2	3	
	4	5	6	
	7	8	9	
	SPIRAL:
	7	8	9	
	6	1	2	
	5	4	3	


Excellent. And for size 4:

	ORIGINAL:
	1	2	3	4	
	5	6	7	8	
	9	10	11	12	
	13	14	15	16	
	SPIRAL:
	7	8	9	10	
	6	1	2	11	
	5	4	3	12	
	16	15	14	13	

Sweet. Proving that this works for other sizes is left as an exercise. [Full code](https://gist.github.com/MikeHoffert/bb67af740626f594fe5f).";;
"you can use ATOMIC_VAR_INIT or atomic_init, the former can be used to initialize at declaration time. In C11

you can use either one, but the built in operators have the following behaviour:

> Built-in increment and decrement operators and compound assignment are read-modify-write atomic operations with total sequentially consistent ordering (as if using {lc|memory_order_seq_cst}}). If less strict synchronization semantics are desired, the standard library functions may be used instead.

basically memory_order_seq_cst is the strictest memory ordering, depending on what you want to do you probably don't want this, especially just for incrementing a counter, where relaxed semantics would suffice.";;

   ComputerOrder

   PartyTrayOrder)

ComputerOrder can only have ComputerParts, Peripherals, and Services

PartyTrayOrder can only have Fruits and Cheeses.

i tried writing a for loop with if statements but it just didnt work. 

";;
"When you say ""it didn't work"", you should include the code you tried and the errors you got.

That said, it sounds like you need to iterate over the dataCollection container, check the type of each item, and then add them to their corresponding lists. I'm not 100% sure I'm understanding you correctly, though.";;
"    public  void process(){
    		for(T g : dataCollection){

"It's still not clear what you want. Can you give an example of some data and what the sorted result should look like?

You say ""create a method that sorts dataCollection elements in to their specific arraylists"", but `dataCollection` is a generic array and you say that it stores `GenericOrder` objects.

Do you mean that you want to take all the items out of `dataCollection` and put them into the appropriate lists? Eg, put the `Fruit`s in the `fruits` list? If so, you'd want `instanceof`.";;

"It's me again :)

This is an interesting one, your nil comes from the line

    puts i.to_s ##

I'll leave this here while I write an explanation.
";;
"A couple of things you may not know first:

* *puts* always evaluates to *nil*, with the side effect of printing to the console.
* If evaluation of a method ends on something that isn't a return statement the last statement is evaluated and returned.

Consider the call *recursive_sort([a, b, c, d], [])*.

The first element is shuffled, then we call *recursive_sort* from inside the if statement (line 19)

The last three elements are shuffled in that call, and the array you want returned - but to line 19 where it is discarded.

The fix is to put a return statement on line 19 i.e.

    if sorted.length > 2
        return recursive_sort sorted, deshuffled
    end

But we don't return and continue evaluating the method.
*sorted == []* so the next if branch is skipped, the last line evaluated is
*puts i.to_s ##* which is *nil*.

&nbsp;

Edit: I lie, it's not the *puts* (though that does evaluate to *nil*), it's the *if* statement, which is skipped, which also evaluates to *nil*. Same idea though.

If you carry on programming you'll be asking yourself ""Where the fuck did that nilull come from?"" many more times.
Don't give up though, you'll learn to work them out.";;
Interesting.  I did not see that coming.;;
Can you read the FAQ and do some Javascript tutorials?;;
"JS would be well suited for interacting with the individual pages, but it'd be tricky to get it to work off of multiple pages for a single procedure (having some external server to hold things for you would make things easier for that). You could probably get away with having a set of scripts with [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) that look out for different pages that you expect to come up and work with them through that.

You might also want to look into [Selenium WebDriver](http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/). It's an API with support for multiple languages that would let you build applications for fairly thorough browser manipulation/automation, even without JS.";;
Thanks y'all for your suggestions. I read up a little more about it and ended up using python and writing a script.;;
Didn't you read the class descriptions before you signed up?  Wtf?;;
"Given the rise of the ""learning to code"" movement, highly doubtful...";;
"You can expect to spend a lot of time thinking ""man, this is easy"", and then a lot of time thinking ""I have no idea what I'm doing"".

Just because you're doing something easy on day 134 doesn't mean day 135 won't be insane.

And just because something looks easy doesn't mean you can actually do it when you sit down at a keyboard.

Stay ahead of the curve, do assignments early, test yourself and learn stuff on your own, and if you start to slide off the tracks seek help immediately.

People are less likely to help you when you've already derailed and are lying in a smoking heap at the bottom of a ravine.

Also, make friends early on.

Inside your field, outside of it, everywhere.  Join the programming clubs, the board game club, the soccer team, the anime club, the band, community service and volunteer clubs, whatever you're interested in.  Join several.

Introduce yourself to the other students in your classes, and to the professors and TA's.  Meet with the latter periodically, if only to say ""I think I get this, but can I talk through it for a minute so you can tell me if I'm wrong?""

And focus on the students who sit near the front.  The ones in back may not stick around long.

And be one of the students who sits near the front, and attend EVERY class.  Don't start skipping, because that works fine a few times and then it doesn't work at all and you'll be completely lost and never catch up.  And you have absolutely no way to predict when that will happen.";;
"Lots of mathematics, mostly discrete.
";;
We only had 2 discrete math classes, and the same 2 Calculus classes almost all other majors had to take.  There were 2 data structures and algos classes that used some of that stuff a little bit.  The vast majority was not what most people would call math-intensive at all.;;
"I would say that that is an unusual implementation of an education program for a branch of mathematics. At my university, we had one calculus class, two algebra classes, one logic class, one semantics class, one automata class, and a bunch of classes that built on those, of which some were more mathematical and others were more practical. For example the datastructures and algorithms classes sat on the border between being math classes and being practical programming classes involving a lot of mathematics, while the compiler technology class was more tool-oriented while still involving a fair amount of maths, and the computer architecture class was more practical.

Those were the mandatory classes, and then you picked the rest. Options included more calculus, more algorithms, constraint programming, software correctness proof techniques, neural networks, logic programming, and so on. Most of this is either pure mathematics or applied mathematics.

You could also choose more practical classes, like compiler technology, object-oriented programming, and software engineering. But the basic classes that everyone took were mostly either in themselves pure mathematics, or involved a lot of applied mathematics.
";;
"> I would say that that is an unusual implementation of an education program for a branch of mathematics.

You mean based on a wild guess, or you actually sampled a lot of Universities required CS classes?";;
"Well OK it's not like I have citations, but I don't live isolated from the world unable to absorb information so it's not a very *wild* guess. I have the impression that universities generally do not use misleading names for their education programs, but rather use names that indicate quite plainly what subjects they consist of.
";;
"> I have the impression that universities generally do not use misleading names for their education programs, but rather use names that indicate quite plainly what subjects they consist of.

Yes, that seems true but not really related.  Unless you mean the classes I mentioned usually aren't in a CS program...";;
"/u/hobackpack's description sounds pretty accurate to my university. There's plenty of mathematical intensive classes, but the key is that they aren't required. It's possible to have only a handful of math intensive classes. A typical student might do:

1. Calc I and II (separate classes)
2. Discrete mathematics and logic
3. Linear algebra
3. Introduction to statistical methods and probability theory (separate classes)
4. Algorithms and data structures
5. Algorithm design and formal automata
6. Image processing and computer vision
7. Computer graphics

And that's about all that a typical student might have for intensive math classes at least somewhat related to their major (I also had physics and a few unrelated math classes). There was a variety of classes that focused on programming stuff like the OS class, software engineering classes, info sec, web dev, etc. They aren't usually very math heavy.

Most of those classes aren't required (but a somewhat typical set of classes). There's other choices, such as more advanced algorithms classes, there's an advanced automata class, a class focused on intractability, etc. These classes are less popular, though, since most CS students seem to prefer programming over heavy maths.";;
"Good for you for choosing to major in Computer Science.  

Here's a video that talks about Computer Science, if you skip to about 1 minute 35 seconds in the video it talks about some of the general things you study in a Computer Science program.  
https://youtu.be/p53N8GTAy2o 

Mainly it ends up being a lot of programming(Java, C++, etc), web development(HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc), Math(Calculus, Discrete Math), and of course all the stuff you have to do with generals.  ";;
They are pretty much the same as far as you will use Racket for the book.  It's got a million other things that 'normal' scheme doesn't have.;;

"I think PTL is an older version which some people advise to use for The Little Schemer. Is that not so?

It appears you are correct in that PLT is an older version and it is now called Racket. As far as which is more advisable I'm not sure. I simply wanted to clear up what I thought was some confusion in your comment.;;
All online C++ courses/tutorials are bad, do not use them. Consider using [Programming -- Principles and Practice Using C++](http://www.stroustrup.com/Programming/), it is probably the best intro book to C++ there is.

"I could look into that. I never taught C++ so I just wanted to find a good starting book or something to just make sure I put the kids on the right track. I don't want to skip over something I forgot etc.

"Add an `id` attribute to your inputs and get them by that ID instead.

    document.getElementById('id-here');

Also, use jsfiddle.net or codepen.io for this kind of stuff. It makes it easier for us to see your issue and offer a solution.";;
The site I intend to try the final version on doesn't have an ID attribute for the input (only unique attributes for the input is placeholder and name). Thank you for the assistance, I was unfamiliar with jsfiddle, which looks like a much better code playground. ;;
"Look at every line and every *piece* of every line, and examine what types you're dealing with, what you think they are, and what you think they're going to do.

A few things are off here. First is that on line 23, you reference a function object (the function you're defining, in fact). You don't *call* the function, which would end in (), you simply state its name and terminate with a semicolon. That'll print out a description of it in the console and move on. Even if it was a successful call, though, why would you call it here? It's iteratively and recursively calling itself, which here will lead to nothing more than running out of memory (a stack overflow). I would take the line out of the function entirely, and leave it to after the function definition.

Next, the way you're attempting to reference the `fname` input and its value isn't valid, and wasteful as well. If you wanted to do it that way, it'd be

    document.forms['sign'].elements['fname'].value = myVar;

but I don't know why you'd bother looking it up that way at all. You already know that `inputs[i]` (whatever `i` happens to be at that point, since the if statement evaluated true) *is* the input. Just use `inputs[i].value`.

Even that's a roundabout way of doing things, though.

`var fname = document.getElementsByName('fname')[0];`
will get you the correct element in a single line ^1 . Or you could get some CSS selector practice in with `document.querySelector()/document.querySelectorAll().`

^1 getElementsByName() returns an array of all the elements with that name, so you have to reference it by index, even if there's only one matching element.";;
"The hardest part will be feeding inputs and data to your AI. You will probably end having to do some sort of image recognition and convert that to meaningful inputs. This is because 99% of computer games involve you seeing the screen. So you have to enable your AI to ""see"" the screen.

Once you can do that, you can put the data through an algorithm and spit out a result. Outputting that result into the game may require more image recognition (where to click) and possibly taking control of the mouse or keyboard to click and type in stuff.

You skipped these hard parts by doing the input/output manually.";;
"Are there any technologies you would recommend? Im guessing OpenCV? My language of preference is Python.

I guess either way, I will need to build my own representation of the game. That way the program will:

 take visual input -> process, translate and make choice-> control mouse/clicks etc";;
Check out the stuff from Al Sweigart (/u/alsweigart). Particularly, his [sushi bot](http://inventwithpython.com/blog/2014/12/17/programming-a-bot-to-play-the-sushi-go-round-flash-game/).;;
"I am not too familiar with image recognition software, sorry. Yes you basically have to create a model of the game for your AI to use.

There may be alternate paths instead of image recognition. If the game produces detailed enough logs or cache data you can parse this to understand the game state. Hearthstone bots use the game logs to get the game state. Eve online market bots use cached data to obtain information. 

If you are dealing with web apps you may be able to directly inject the command instead of dealing with controling the mouse/keyboard too.

If you have access to source code, it is also significantly easier as you can put in api calls and log/data dumps.

The more complex the game the complex the software needs to be (obviously.) A tic-tac-toe bot would be vastly easier to program compared to a league of legends bot.";;
"You'd better determine what do you mean by ""networking"". At low level it is about sending data through sockets etc - you can practice it a bit by creating client and server apps and making them communicate. There are tons of examples for both python and C++

It would be useful to try anyway. Will not take much time.

But if you are about higher level - e.g. building web-applications for example - you are to learn a bit about HTTP protocol itself and then about HTML for web-pages, and how your favorite language can generate HTML dynamically.

The following could be helpful to start, though you surely will need much more. But you need to start to understand where to dig further:

There are many - odin project, courses at coursera etc. You'll easily find them.";;
Thanks for the info, I was actually considering both. Building low level applications would be fun experimenting/troubleshooting, whereas high level programming might be nice in the future for building practical products.;;
It is important to understand low-level to help you easier debug the upper level. E.g. HTTP (high level) is working over TCP (middle level) over IP (lower level) over well, ethernet (physical level). When you have some trouble with reading HTTP response - it is good if you understand how socket timeouts work etc. E.g. it is good if you do not think HTTP is some kind of mystic but just a plain text going to and from over socket.;;
"Create a basic program that sends a string to the specified ip/port.

Create a second program that listens on that ip/port and prints out any received strings.

Congratulations you now know how every network works. The rest is security, data verification/validation, optimization.

There should be plenty of information on how to acomplish a basic network in any language. For C/C++ look up sockets. Here is a decent tutorial for them: http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm";;
If you're going to do networking coding, I'd suggest Java over C/C++, it's just the more sane way(easier) of doing it.   You can Google servers/clients to play with.  Networking on paper is easy.   The semi hard part is making your system secure against hackers, but you can learn that later after your stuff works as long as you're not publishing systems.;;

"It was more based around the theory of networking:

-Designing/building a network

-Learning about different topologies(star, bus, ring, etc)

-Network troubleshooting tools and procedures 

-Different protocols

-stuff like subnetting, supernetting, ports, full duplex, half duplex, etc.

"I recently graduated from Dev Bootcamp (DBC) Chicago. Don't fret about the interview.  

Successful communication is a successful answer; you do not need to solve the puzzles.  Explain your thought process as you work through the coding and logic puzzles, and ask questions about anything that gives you trouble.

The general philosophy of DBC is not to create an unsurpassable barrier to entrance.  DBC does not pride itself in low admittance rates; they would view that as a failure to teach.  DBC's goal is to take a diverse range of applicants and turn them into Rails developers.  The program is challenging, and you will work hard to get through it, but you are not a number, a piece of paper, or a solution to a puzzle.  You are a person with value, and the interviewer just wants to make sure you'll have a good experience in the program.

That makes sense, were it not such a golden opportunity; a completely paid for year-long course Java or C++ (no other languages) during work hours (one day and evening a week). Plus, I'm pretty excited to be learning something completely unfamiliar.;

"Java probably still has pointers.

The reason java ""doesn't have pointers"" is because the implementation of the heap and reference variables is jvm dependant. The most likely case is that your reference variables are, in fact, just a pointer.

Ugh. What language are you guys working in?;;
Out backend is in python which is at least easy to write. ;;
I've never written in python so I couldn't tell. I got spoiled in my second job with .net and VS and I'll probably never take another job that's not in that framework. VS kicks ass as an editor and I love entity framework / linq. ;;
"I haven't spent enough/any time in VS to actually enjoy it. I've done most of my C++/C development in Linux in a basic text editor and haven't any need for the .NET framework with VS yet. 

I highly recommend python though. I didn't know the language before I started this job three weeks ago and it is now my favorite language to write. You can write insanely powerful scripts in just a few short minutes with nothing but the base language. Like File I/O in C requires a bunch of imports. Python requires zero that you have to remember.";;

I'm 19 and doing my first internship. I had no idea what I was going to do at the company till my third day. I was rewritting old and unused code for my first couple of projects but now im in charge of making my own code I have to wing it and learn new things everyday.;;
"This article hits close to home. After teaching myself 4 programming languages due to different work needs, this has been the case all the time. Whenever I go to a new workplace, I had to learn a new programming language and I had to study a new codebase. I ended up taking a few mental notes on how to learn a new language really fast by doing standard stuff like, find the language's pointer equivalents, how dictionaries/arrays are defined, how objects and classes are defined.

Same goes with learning a new codebase. It has become a norm for me to read up other people's bug reports and fixes, and debugging code to understand the code rather than to debug it. And of course, inserting random lines of code to see how it breaks. Or studying the multiple modules that has been written for it, trying to look for their common essence.

And, with every new codebase you studied and with every new language you learned, you become more and more proficient at 'winging it'. I like how meta that sounds. When other people go deeper into one or a few subjects, we go deeper into the art of getting yourself just deep enough into a subject.

Learning the term 'winging it' really puts my heart at ease with what I'm doing. I was an electronics engineer, and now I'm in web development.";;
"Not 100% sure from what you've given, but you probably want this:

And as long as they started out as separate lists they will continue to be so.

that's a pretty weird assumption to make when the initialization line is also declaring myD6, so it can't have any other value.;;
"Hello and thanks for the reply.

Let me explain with an example what is happening and what I want to do.

     tempDiceList is [5,5,5,5]
     passing to myD6, now both ArrayLists are [5,5,5,5]
     after tempDiceList is cleared so it's empty.
     Second round the tempDiceList is [6]
     passing to myD6, now MyD6 has only 1 element, [6]

That's what is happening. That I want is after the second round
     
     myD6 to have [5,5,5,5,6].";;
Yes, then I'm pretty sure what I said is accurate.;;
"java class variables are references, so tempDiceList and myD6 are the same array list. You probably want to do something like 

    ArrayList<Integer> myD6 = new ArrayList<>(myPlayer.getTempDiceList());

which actually makes a new array list for myD6";;
Thanks for your help and reply man. I got it now.;;
"/u/rjcarr and /u/dacian88 are both correct. 

When you write
  
    ArrayList<Integer> myD6 = myPlayer.getTempDiceList();

    public ArrayList<Integer> getTempDiceList() {
        return tempDiceList;
    }
    
it is equivalent to

    myD6 = tempDiceList;

Which doesn't make two arraylists equivalent, it makes the variable `myD6` and `tempDiceList` point to the same ArrayList. It makes them the same object. So whatever you do to one variable will obviously happen to the other. Which is why `tempDiceList.clear()` will clear `myD6` as well.

"There are definitely a lot of options in the microsoft stack, however people generally have agreed upon which technologies are good to use and I'll to run through them:

DB: LINQ vs Entity Framework isn't a correct comparison because you can use LINQ in EF. LINQ is a query syntax that you can use with EF, other ORMS or even just an array. EF on the otherhand is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and actually knows how to talk with a database SQL Server. There are also mini ORMs like Dapper.

In general people use EF because it's easy to get started and does a lot for you (object tracking, etc). However, it does come with a performance hit (in version 6 at least, version 7 which is in beta is much much faster).

Now the better comparison is EF vs ADO.NET. I personally find EF to be more productive but ADO.NET does give you a lot of power. Not many people use DataSets/DataViews anymore, instead ADO.NET is used to fetch data and then it's loaded into a collection of models. 

You can use Stored procs with ADO.NET or EF.

Lists are just in memory data and not a database access technology, but you can use EF or ADO.NET to store your data in a List or an IEnumerable (base class for List and other collections).


Desktop:
WinForms works great but is outdated and has it's limitations. WPF has more features, and lets build much nicer and more modular apps. It's officially the replacement for WinForms. It has a pattern called MVVM to seperate concerns, and the UI is written in XAML which is very extensible. There is a slight learning curve, but you can use WPF drag and drop much in the way you do with WinForms. I wouldn't use WinForms for a new desktop project unless that was my only option.

Web:
MVC is newer and what most people are using. WebForms is mostly for legacy apps. In fact in the new ASP.NET 5 world, WebForms isn't even available. People on WebForms will go do the ASP.NET 4.x road.

So as to what the difference is. WebForms is an abstraction over the web. It's a framework that tries to make Web Development feel like desktop development. Button click handlers and what not. While this was cool 15 years ago, the web is different today and we want more control. ASP.NET MVC is similar to rails and other mvc framworks and gives you more flexibility, control and conventions. IT's what most ASP.NET shops are using to build new products.

Organization: This is right up my alley as a Software Architect. The truth is , it depends. It depends on the project size, scalability requirements, team size etc. In many cases a simple 3 tier architecture will work and you can call it a day. For larger apps I like use a more layered approach and follow something close to Domain Driven Design (DDD). However, on the flip side I don't like to get too dogmatic and follow everything to a T. At the end of the day it's about finding a way to make your code modular, with good seperation of concerns and unit testable. You want your code to be solid so that you can easily make changes without worrying. I've been in environments where people refuse to touch code because of intense coupling and one small change could bring the system down. That is not cool!

There's definitely more stuff to factor in (SOLID, Depenency Injection, IOC container chocies, testing framework choices and more). As you start working on this stuff you'll figure it out. Feel free to pm me if you have any questions.";;
"I kind of wonder if the OP was thinking of Linq to Entities? ...I mean, it's possible.

For the OP: Linq to Entities was an earlier ORM-like product from MS that was considered by some (...however many years ago...) to be better than EF (or, at least, it was when I was learning) because it offered greater control over how you queried the DB. Of course, that was like two or three major versions of EF ago...

Anyway, of course you can still use it today. I remember liking it, too. I just remember there was also more typing involved in using it. If I were going to choose an ORM for use with SQL Server right now, I'd go with EF, no questions asked. The performance hit isn't even a consideration; if I need something to be super quick, there's no rule saying I can't just query the DB the old fashioned way for that one case.

This is assuming 20 GB for windows 7 from their system reqs, and 5 gigs for Ubuntu. 

This will be the first time I get a laptop purely for school work, no games, etc, so I'm not sure how much space 256GB will actually be until I use it. ";;
"256 GB should be plenty. That's how much my SSD is on my desktop, which has both games and programming stuff installed. I only keep a couple of games installed at a time, though, due to space constraints. The drive dual booted Win7 and Linux Mint, although the Linux Mint partition is fairly small.

Without games, I usually have around 70 GB free (installing GTA V with its 60 GB download was a bitch because I couldn't have any other games installed at the same time).

Of note is that you probably don't need OS X for school work (university dependent). I've never used OS X for school. Almost everything is Linux compatible with a very tiny bit of Windows stuff (literally a portion of an assignment in one class).";;
"Yeah the only time I had something Windows dependent was one class where our professor required us to do our C++ in VS 2013. 

The reason I was considering OS X in the first place is that I have access to a proper unix terminal (although you could argue that I can just use Cygwin on Windows), but without the bugginess and troubleshooting of using Linux. I know for sure that Ubuntu never plays well with my stock Realtek WiFi drivers, and I always have to find something to rebuild it or something. 

My friend is of the opinion that OS X requires little to no troubleshooting which supposedly increases productivity, which seems to be his only reason for using it over Linux. Others have also said that unless you're part of the Apple ecosystem (I'm an android guy), then I might even hate OS X. The only real reason I have for getting a macbook would be that build quality is guaranteed to be top notch. ";;

OS X certainly does have good hardware compatibility, though, since Apple carefully picks the hardware (the average laptop doesn't use as good hardware and is usually meant for Windows -- although you can find laptops made for Linux). The downside is that the markup is extreme. You can get better hardware for the same price from other manufacturers. I'm also not a personal fan of the OS and it's design philosophy.";;

What do you think you need to have passed into the function?;;
"I have a text-to-speech component that is connected to a speaker.  So I'd need to be able to send the text to the ""say"" function.  Note: timer.setTimeout takes in two arguments: a time in milliseconds and a function to call (a callback).

    say (string text): void {
      emicSerial.write(""S"" + text + """");
    }

    // For lack of knowledge on how to bind a function callback with parameters, I'm going to fall back on javascript's way
    timer.setTimeout(1000, say.bind(""this is text to be said by text-to-speech module""))
    timer.setTimeout(2000, say.bind(""Beep beep, I'm a robot!""))
    timer.setTimeout(3000, say.bind(""This is even more text to be said!""))";;
Ok, what `bind` in JS gives you is a context to call the function. In C++ to do that you use functors (short for function object.) They are just a class that overloads the `()` operators and can be called like a function. You might look into something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1840029/passing-functor-as-function-pointer;;
no, bind creates a new function, there's no equivalent in c. Typically in C you pass the arguments via a void* when registering the callback. This depends on the api you use obviously.;;
Can you elaborate on this?;;
"in c setTimeout might look like

    void setTimeout(int ms, void (*callback)(void *), void *args);

then you can create a callback handler, your args and register them

    struct my_args { ... };
    void my_func(void *args) {
        my_args *casted = args;
        // use your args
    }

    ....
    my_args args = malloc(sizeof(my_args));
    // set args to whatever
    setTimeout(100, my_func, args);

i mean in C it's actually possible to write a bind equivalent but that requires generating code at runtime...";;
"> I need to register arguments with a function pointer that will be called later

You can't do that it in C. C doesn't have higher-order functions like Javascript does. C function pointers are just that - a pointer to a function. I don't know if there's a way do it in C++, but I know that you can't do it with a raw function pointer.

What I'd do (in C) is create a struct that contains your function pointer and the arguments, and write a routine that takes that struct and calls the function with the argument. If you have multiple functions and they need different arguments, have them all take an argument of void* and then cast that to the type you actually need inside the function. There might be a better way to do in C++, but I don't know much about that.

If you're using a library that takes a raw function pointer and doesn't allow it to take any arguments, you're pretty much out of luck - but I doubt any library would work like that since it would limit the possible applications, so check the documentation to see if it provides a way of passing arguments.";;
"Random thoughts on your post:

 * I'm pretty sure there are emacs plugins for eclipse that honor many of the same key commands, especially for editing.

 * I believe there is cygwin for windows that gives you a posix shell.  The last time I used it, over a decade ago, it was pretty shitty but that was a long time ago.

 * There's nothing requiring you, technically, to develop java in eclipse.  Why not just do your editing of the files in emacs and do whatever else you need (e.g., debugging) in eclipse?  At least until you're more up to speed.

"*Regarding Cygwin:* I am trying to use it. While it does address many of the issues that Windows's `cmd` has, I am still trying to sort out some weirdness (e.g. CLI interfaces that expect CR-LF but only receive CR not recognizing the newline). I am also combining it with ConsoleZ to try to get some tabbing mechanism going.

*Regarding editors:* I have tried to use the Windows port of Emacs in the past, and have found it really janky, with buggyonexistent support for some very useful plugins (such as tramp). I will install the Eclipse Emacs plugin as you suggested, and if worst comes to worst, I can just use the CLI-Emacs that can run inside Cygwin.

And you're right; while I am technically not *required* to use Eclipse (Atom actually comes packaged on my machine), in-depth Java code comprehension is vital to actually being productive in a complex and often poorly documented codebase. It feels like a crutch (plus an excuse to write incomprehensible code because the tooling allows me) and I don't like it, but pride goes before the fall.

3. Thats not true, SDL, which was written entirely in C and supports OpenGL is cross platform and provides a solid abstraction layer for the platform specific API's such as Win32. On top of that, a GUI library I am currently working on will hopefully address this issue. The plan for the library is too create some interactive GUI builder which generates clean and fast C code which can be put in your project, of course it wouldn't have to be used, but it would let designers quickly throw something together knowing its fast and cross platform. That being said, html/css are only ""cross platform"" because they are practically giant strings which get passed around, parsed, and interpreted by some web browser framework (such as chromium) which is written and compiled as native machine code. This is a horrendously slow process compared a language such as c/c++ which gets compiled into the processors assembly language, there is NO arguing that, period, saying otherwise makes you a fool, or moron. 

I would love it if people stopped writing high-level web crap, but sadly that's the state of computing these days. Personally I refuse to use web-apps such as Atom.io which is evidently slow with large files. This is why I don't use a smartphone and I opt to have a cheap flip phone, the damn thing is fast beyond hell, everything opens instantly and the device is responsive and lasts for a week on a full charge. My Android tablet on the other hand lasts a day at best, takes several seconds to load apps up, including the android keyboard which is just a solid color rectangle in the background and a bunch of characters, last time I checked, terminal based os's were doing that 30+ years ok just fine, don't see why its so hard for my infinitely more powerful tablet. Google made a horrible decision choosing Java as the primary development language for Android, and their lack of a proper NDK without any JIT bs is absurd. Apple, while no better got this right which is why a flagship iPhone can have significant less powerful specs than an Android and still perform better, half the battery, and an IPS screen, and still get better/similar battery life.";;
"TLDR most of that... I agree with your first point, but I already said that.

All I am saying is there's no GUI framework that looks native on all platforms, but Atom (yes, I know you hate it) comes close. Having used Atom and other Electron-based stuff on a daily basis for several months, I can safely say it is not perceptibly laggy--or not moreso than any other IDE I have used, anyway. I wouldn't use that for any application where performance was critical, but that's not applicable in any area I've heard of.

As for the battery life thing, we were discussing desktop apps.";;
"> As for the battery life thing, we were discussing desktop apps.

Does it matter? Why if your program can cut the cpu cycles in half it means the cpu has more time to go to sleep, saving power and reducing your electrically bill (a small amount). On top of that, My pc at anytime has dozens, if not hundreds of threads/processing running at any one time. If the devs of all those had the same mentality of high-level and web-devs of ""who cares about performance"" then my pc would perform much, much worse. 

Also, atom is still slow. Clearly you haven't tried out something like Vim/Emacs (yes I realize Emacs it's as up to snuff as Vim but it's still better than most crap).";;
"I guarantee you that none of those devs cares about performance as much as you'd like. It doesn't make economic sense. 

Actually, I use vim a lot. (I have a whole series of screencasts in vim; I've linked to them a few times here.) It isn't any faster. UI performance is the least of my concerns when editing code, of course; I'm usually waiting on linters and compilers more than anything else. 

How long it takes to reflow a block of text is an afterthought by comparison. :)";;
"You can already do this. 

Windows Universal apps, tidesdk, chromium embedded (some games use this like hearthstone), node-webkit, etc all let you use web based technologies for your desktop application. ";;
We can, for example by using [WebKit](http://www.webkit.org/).;;

[Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef)

"We do! 

Take [Atom.io](https://atom.io/), for example -- it runs HTML, CSS, JavaScript on what's basically a [stripped-down version of Chrome](http://electron.atom.io/). (More specifically, using Chromium, the open-source core of Chrome).

Other languages have similar libraries -- for example, Python has [cefpython](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/).

(of course, this approach also has some downsides -- a common criticism that people have is that the entire stack is too slow compared to native applications/that it feels like overkill to basically bundle a browser with your application. For example, I believe Atom.io was plagued with performance issues when it was first released, and still can't handle very large files (though I might be wrong about this))";;
"In theory you could however it would be easier to write such a platform from the ground up rather than removing things from the browser. And modifying a browser in such a way would be a lot of work.

Languages like C# and the .Net framework however provide a LOT of functionality that you just wouldn't have if you did something like this, so all that would have to be rewritten.

Also for some applications it might not be a viable solution in terms of performance.

So I guess the answer is you could, but it wouldn't get you much benefit.";;
Windows 8 and beyond allows you to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to develop Windows Store apps.;;
"That already exists in the form of things like [NW.js](http:/wjs.io/) (formerly Node-webkit), [Electron](https://github.com/atom/electron), and [Chromium Embedded Framework](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef).  A fair number of popular applications are build using these (e.g. Spotify.)
";;
"You can do this now in a couple ways.  

 * First, as /u/diesch says, you can simply embed a web renderer and whatever else you need (e.g., javascript engine) in your application.

 * Second, your application can essentially be a web server that starts up when the program starts and then opens itself up in the default browser.

The first option is a bit cleaner for the user but harder to do.  The latter is a bit unnatural but works fine.";;
"Somewhat relevant: here's an article I read which has an interesting approach to teaching web development: http://pgbovine.net/teaching-web-programming.htm

The author (Phillip Guo) deliberately avoids teaching his students anything about frameworks, with the possible exception of jQuery. For example, he starts off teaching backend programming by using Python and CGI, and teaching his students how to manually put together an HTTP response, headers and all, in an attempt to teach them the fundamentals, then as a concession spent about 30 minutes [teaching Flask](http://pgbovine.net/flask-python-tutorial.htm) later in his course.

It's a bit of an unusual curriculum and stands in sharp contrast to most popular ""learn to make a website"" courses today, though I think if executed properly, it could be a very good introduction/better then most courses currently available. It seems related to what you're trying to do/might be helpful when designing your curriculum, so I'd figure I might as well share it.

"There is definitely a balance because frameworks are extremely helpful in getting things up quickly. I think diving into http request headers might be a bit too deep.

Plenty of people have learned ruby through rails development, but I would want to know at least how the basic syntax of a language works before going into a framework.

Definitely don't need to master a language before learning a framework though.";;

">I just don't know what the next steps are

Make something. Any kind of project. No hand-holding tutorials or single file things, this time. It doesn't have to be a real world project (eg, you could create a POS system for a fake store).

Start small. Identify the core components and start by implementing one of them (or part of one), slowly expanding it into the full system. Don't try and plan it all out ahead of time in specifics.

In creating such a project, you'll naturally find problems to solve (and real world problems at that) as well as get an idea of working with a larger project (but gradually). Don't worry too much about if some approach might not be the best way to implement it (*do* try and pick good solutions to problems, just don't spend too much time and stress thinking about that). Remember that you can usually refactor things in the future if you find a better approach. For now, concentrate on getting something that works (and try to identify ways to improve the code).

Later, try contributing to a large existing project. Give yourself some time. Even simple changes can take hours at first because you don't know where the relevant place to make the change is. The first (and possibly hardest) part of your task is to find that place. You can do so by searching for relevant words and by following definitions and function calls of relevant looking things (it takes some guess work).";;
That's hugely helpful. Now I just need to figure out a good project. Would anyone suggest buying literature as at the very least a supplement to my coding journey?;;
"The first step is definitely just to get coding. Pick a personal project and work on that. It will mean spending non-work hours on something for work, but such is life.

Have you expressed your desire to move into coding at work? Maybe your manager would be able to help you find a path from where you are to where you want to be. Not all managers are cool with someone on their team wanting to move on, but if you feel comfortable having that conversation with him or her, you really should.

Do you have access at work to the back-end source (obviously, you probably don't have commit access to their version control repository, but maybe you have read access?) and/or your company's defect and work item lists? Maybe you could spend breaks and lunch hours informally assigning yourself work items and going over the code to try and find solutions to real-world problems. If you don't have access to these things, maybe you could make friends with someone on the development team. Just be very careful about your company's policies with respect to their code base. Don't try to talk anyone into, say, copying parts of the code base to a thumb drive for you to look at, or whatever. That's a good way to get fired. But maybe a friend on the development team could talk to you about problems they are facing and you could model that problem in a personal project to try and find a solution.

you'd better alternate color depending on `(x + y) % 2` - e.g. return `red` if it is `1` and `black` if `0`.;;
I'm not sure how that would help. According the the console.log the color variable alternates just fine. However, the actual color doesn't change until the next row.;;
"He means that `pickColor` could be:

    ((x + y) % 2) ? ""red"" : ""black""

It also works well: http://jsbin.com/devedifeqe/edit?js,output

EDIT: To explain why yours doesn't work, consider the order things are drawn in. x = 0 for the first inner loop while it's y that is changing. So while you are alternating colors, you're not drawing the alternated colors in the right location.";;

No that's not what functional programming means. First-class and higher order functions are part of it, but other concepts such as pure functions (functions w/ no side effects) data immutability, etc... are very important. ;;
"[JavaScript isn't Scheme](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/07/18/javascript-isnt-scheme/).
";;
Functional programming is more than that, but you absolutely can do functional programming in Javascript.  Start writing scripts that use recursion and don't mutate variables.;;
"While JavaScript does borrow a lot of inspiration from functional languages, and _has_ been leaning towards a functional mindset of late, I'd argue that it's in many respects the _antithesis_ of functional programming -- the complete opposite. 

Some of the hallmarks of functional programming include:

- First-class functions (and a strong reliance on using higher-order functions)
- Immutable data (once a variable/value is set, it cannot be changed)
- Strong typing (and languages like Haskell and OCaml also use a type system firmly based on mathematical principles (category theory, etc))
- Emphasis on purity and referential transparency (side-effects are explicitly marked and delineated from code with no side-effects/the language tries to eliminate side effects entirely/people try to write functions such given some input, you get the same output each time)
- A tendency to use recursion instead of loops

Out of all of these features, JavaScript only really has the first one -- first-class functions, and some basic higher order functions like map and reduce. Apart from that, JavaScript shares pretty much none of the other characteristics:

- Everything is mutable in JavaScript. The DOM is mutable, every single object you create is mutable, JSON is mutable, etc...
- JavaScript has notoriously weak typing. There's a good/funny talk which goes over some of the peculiarities arising from JavaScript typing system -- I recommend checking it out: https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat (it starts off talking about Ruby initially, but switches to JavaScript partway through). 
- JavaScript is all about side effects (the end goal is usually to manipulate or change something about the DOM, to request data from the server, etc). 
- You rarely, if ever, see recursion in JavaScript code.

(And while first-class functions and higher-order functions are nice, they're now basically become integrated into pretty much every single mainstream language -- JavaScript isn't particularly stronger or better in this respect. If you were to classify JavaScript as a functional language, you'd also have to classify almost every other mainstream language as a functional language as well, which doesn't really work)";;
"> You rarely, if ever, see recursion in JavaScript code.

What exactly are you referencing to here, or in what surrounding context is that statement? Are you *supposed* to see more recursion? I mean, there *is* recursion in JS, but I get a funny feeling as though you think it's ... not enough?";;
"The statement was meant to mirror and provide contrast to the last bullet point in the first group.

I guess it's not really a matter of whether or not I think JavaScript has ""enough"" recursion or not -- my main point was that if you compare and contrast JavaScript vs a programming language that skews very heavily towards the functional end of the spectrum, you see an interesting difference in how the languages approach the idea of looping. 

With a functional language, if you want to loop, you basically use recursion, point blank. While there may be explicit looping constructions, they're definitely strongly de-emphasized, especially in a lot of the introductory tutorials and course work you see.

In contrast, with JavaScript, if you want to use a loop, well, you use a for loop or a while loop (or I suppose window.setTimeout). ";;
"Wow! Amazing answer. Thanks :)

So it's fair to say having a background in Javascript is *not* beneficial to a job in functional programming?";;
"I agree with /u/smokefreeyear -- a background in JavaScript is mostly irrelevant. It's neither harmful nor particularly helpful. 

It might help a little in that it'll help you get accustomed to working with first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures, but that's about it.";;
">So it's fair to say having a background in Javascript is not beneficial to a job in functional programming?

No, I wouldn't say that. The parent post is being too broad. It's listing not only things that *are* functional programming, but also some features that are common in some very popular functional languages. Immutability is not required for FP, for example, and can be detrimental in some situations.

Scala is an example of a functional (and OO) language that doesn't require immutability. It emphasizes immutability, with that being the norm and default, but doesn't require it. Similarly, Scala also has regular loops.

With that said, going from JS to Haskell is not going to be easy. It'll be almost like learning to program for the first time. However, there's certainly some concepts that JS has that will be useful in utilizing functional programming in general, including in Haskell. For example, JS has functions are first class citizens, allowing us to pass functions as arguments (very common in Haskell) and also utilize higher order functions (eg, `Array.reduce` is roughly equal in functionality to Haskell's `foldl`).

To recap, JS *is* a functional language (amongst other paradigms). And yes, many languages are functional. I'm not sure why the parent post has problems with that idea.";;
"> So it's fair to say having a background in Javascript is not beneficial to a job in functional programming?

It is if you use it for functional programming.  Languages support different programming paradigms.  It's not really correct to say a certain language IS or IS NOT a certain programming paradigm.";;

Edited, let me know if you need anymore information, sorry for any confusion;;
"You didn't fulfill the requirements:

> Complexity: expected worst-case time complexity is O(N); expected worst-case space complexity is O(1)

You use `sort` and then loop over the input, meaning you exceeded the time complexity, and you make a new array of length N, meaning you exceeded the space complexity. This means you need a different solution.

Regarding your code:

- Avoid using `using namespace ...`
- `solution()` is a bad name for a function.
- Don't use `int` as an array index or size, use `std::size_t`.
- Don't use `i++` when you mean `++i`.
- Take a look at [`std::iota`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/algorithm/iota) for creating ranges.
- Why use `ans` and a `break`? Just `return` immediately.";;
"1. I figured using namespace was alright in this situation, though I do understand that using namespace ... is a poor coding habit outside of this.
2. solution() was the name of the given function on the test.
3. Okay, I'll definitely keep this in mind.
4. Can you show an example when this can go wrong? ++i vs i++?
5. Alright.
6. You're definitely right. Thank you!";;
"> Can you show an example when this can go wrong? ++i vs i++?

    
    for (auto itt = SomeClass.begin(); itt != SomeClass.end(); itt++) {}

In this case, if `SomeClass` is of some complex or user-defined type, the compiler will not always be able to optimise.

In your code, the compiled code for `i++` and `++i` will likely be the same. This is due to compiler optimisations, but there is no guarantee the compiler will help you. In general, `i++` can be slower than `++i` (and in some cases: must be slower).

However, the real issue is more basic. In your code, you mean `++i`. You don't want the effects of `i++`, so you shouldn't write it. This goes for all code you write: if there are two close to identical things you could write, stick to the one which best conveys your intentions to a reader.";;
"Your solution doesn't meet the space complexity requirement. You can only use a constant amount of space which means you cannot allocate a new vector. Your code also does not meet the time complexity requirement since sort has a worst case of N*log(N).

Have you considered a more mathematical approach? What do you know about the set of all numbers from 1 to N+1? What is their sum?";;
"I guess the vector wasn't even needed and that I could have just used the an int n+1.

Oh. I could have calculated the sum of all the numbers, subtracted all the elements in A, and returned the remaining answer.

You know b[i] is always i so you can do

"I have a few comments about your code.

1. Your function accepts a reference to a vector and applies the sort function, modifying the contents of the vector not just in the function, but outside the function scope as well. For this exercise it doesn't matter, but for a production level code, you most likely don't want this behavior.

2. The problem states that the code should have linear scaling. Since you use sort, you won't have linear scaling. Basically, there's a quicker code/solution. Think about is for a while and come up with a different algorithm.

3. Why do you initialize ans to a value that's never used for anything?";;
"1/2. Ah I understand. Meefims' comment helped me understand that sort wasn't necessary. Thank you!

"Angular and other similar front end frameworks' main advantage over back-end templating engines is that since they run in the front end, they're way more responsive to user input then a back-end framework alone can be.

You can do things like dynamically change the page as users type in search results, implement faster, more responsive auto-complete, allow users to change local settings without having to send a request to the server every single time, etc...

(it's also not usually an either-or sort of thing. Front-end frameworks like Angular and back-end frameworks like Express are complementary -- they each can do things that the other fundamentally cannot, and so it's pretty common to pair them together)

Note that Angular is not the only front-end framework you can use (though it's a very popular one). You have frameworks like Ember, React, Backbone, etc... and can always fall back to using only jQuery or JavaScript. The question of which front-end framework you should pick (and whether or not you even need one) is a complex discussion, and is something you should definitely research.";;

"> Benchmarks (micro- and not) say otherwise, they show that go is reliably slower than well written JS or python run on V8 and PyPy.


source ? ";;
"I've not see these examples of node and pypy running faster than go so I can't comment but this has not been the case in my personal experience.


However I will point out that getting good IO performance out of python and node requires that you write async/evented code which does FAR FAR more damage to your codebase than the lack of generics.
";;
So how does go take care of IO performance?;;
"Let's take a normal IO interaction... Forgive my overly verbose/simple example for the sake of clarity.

    def handle_request(request, response)
        data = request.read
        ok = validate_and_write_to_db(data)
        response.write(ok)
    end

This method has 3 lines and does IO 3 times.  First reading from the network, second writing to the database, third writing to the network.  Each one of these steps could block and grinding execution to a halt.  This is normally not acceptable b/c we want to service multiple requests at the same time.

Your choices are normally

**Threading** Create one thread per request.  This works great but your can only have dozens or hundreds of threads per server.  If you want to service millions of simultaneous customers you will need many thousands of servers (possibly at very low CPU utilization as each thread is blocking on IO).

**Async IO** This is the real solution for IO concurrency.  This is what's at the guts of Nginx and HAProxy and Node.js and Python's Twisted and Ruby's Eventmachine.  You basically have a tight C loop on one CPU polling lots and lots of file descriptors and calling callbacks on each one for IO.  It however forces you to write ugly evented code.  This is the same example nodejs-ified.

    var handle_request = function(req,res) {
      req.read(function(data) {
        validate_and_write_to_db(data, function(ok) {
          res.write(ok)
        })
      })
    }

Each function that performs IO is passed a function as an argument to be called when the function completes.  So any series of steps that at any point touch the network or disk require a level of indentation.  This creates really messy code but because you get to scale from hundreds of simultaneous requests to millions is normally accepted as totally freaking worth it.

Some languages create higher level abstractions to concurrency to allow you to avoid this mess.  Go uses **Coroutines**, Erlang and Scala have **Actors**.  In principle they are basically the same.  In Go you would just type

    func HandleRequest(req Request, res Response) {
      data := req.Read()
      ok := ValidateAndWriteToDb(data)
      res.Write(ok)
    }

This allows the code in the function to run serially - blocking - just as in the first example but go offers a lighter weight alternative to threads... In the calling function you just add the keyword ""go""

    go HandleRequest(req,res)

And that function is resolved asynchronously, maybe on the same CPU, maybe on another.  All the IO is handled using async syscalls under the hood.  You get the simple code of the threading model and the performance of the async model (better actually b/c node and twisted will schedule everything to a single CPU).  The language also provides channels as a way for goroutines to synchronize and share data without having to have race conditions, so there is no need for Mutex's or other deadlock-creating constructs.

So the point was: yes the lack of generics makes for ugly copy-paste in 5% of your codebase.  But callbacks make for ugly code in every function that calls any function that will eventually do any IO (which is pretty much all of them).";;
That's really interesting stuff/links you posted, thanks for sharing.;;
Can you elaborate on coroutines? I use Async alot in my personal project (node.js), and always hated the ugly code, being wanting to try out something else that is more maintainable, I read the doc, and wiki, but still not sure how it functions like async, seems to be that coroutines are very similar to generators, which is different from what async are doing;;
"Sure.  First the programming you do in go is synchronous, one command followed by another, no nesting... but the syscalls being made to the kernel are asynchronous.  When you call a synchronous IO function in go, another goroutine is scheduled to run on that CPU while the first one blocks.  This allows you to have millions of goroutines doing IO simultaneously but with simple serial code.


The tools they give you are channels and the ""go"" keyword.


If you put ""go"" in front of a function the function runs in another goroutine.  Secondly you are given channels which can be read to or written to in a thread safe manner. 


Ok overly simple code time...  Let's say you want to fetch URL1 and URL2 and the concatenate the response of both... but you want to download them concurrently.  (this example is kind of silly and verbose and ignores error handling but it should explain the concept).

    func FetchURLToChannel(url string, c chan string) {
      body,_ := FetchURL(url)
      c <- body   # send the body via the channel
    }

    func GetTwoURLSAndCat(url1 string, url2 string) string {
      c := make(chan string)
      go FetchURLToChannel(url1, c) # this runs concurrently
      go FetchURLToChannel(url2, c) # this runs concurrently
      return <-c + <-c      # this blocks until both downloads are done
    }

This allows you to easily think through concurrency problems without needing ""critical code sections"" and mutexes or callbacks.";;
"While a lot of the benchmarks are outdated, and I've no doubt go has improved since 2012 (hell python's json parsing and file io have both improved 2-4x in that period) [this](http://blog.hackingthought.com/2012/04/part-2-dart-vs-go-vs-python-and-pypy.html) shows that python and pypy both outperfom go in IO bound code, specifically opening, parsing, and doing a bit of work on a json document.

>async/evented code which does FAR FAR more damage to your codebase than the lack of generics.

I'm assuming you're talking about how goroutines are great, if so, then python 3.5 adds the async/await keywords from C# which do practically the same thing that goroutines do (as in, they're a first class way of creating generators/async code, and much clearer than yield and yield from)";;
"2012 is pretty old for go.  It had just come out and hey had done not performance work on it yet.


[These framework benchmarks](https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/#section=data-r10) are very recent and make for a good comparison of what each language/framework can do with a request-json-database-response cycle with no other business logic.


Glad to hear python got async/await keywords.  That's going to help a ton.  I'll look into it.

";;
">is in the same power/simplicity ballpark as Python

My initial impression of Go, just from looking at sample code, is that it is barely any simpler than C.";;
I would really encourage you to give it a second look.  Garbage collections, safe memory access, goroutines, channels, native maps and slices, polymorphism through interfaces, an amazing standard library.  Sure it looks like C and performs (almost) like C, but it plays like Ruby/Python.;;

I find it interesting that all the most popular languages on that list appeared in the 90s. It could be a coincidence, but the mainstreaming of computers really peaked in the 90s and we see so many people active/learning in that generation pushing where things go.;;
Computers definitely didn't peak in the 90's, just they exploded on to the scene. People could finally start affording them and a lot more people had access to them and becoming interested in them. There are definitely many more people active in computers today, and we're seeing things really explode right now.;;
What I mean by mainstreaming is the rate of change in saturation level - and I feel that the 90s was really when you had the fourth wall break down in a lot of ways where average users became a lot more computer literate.;;

Is that dataset maybe a bit biased? Kind of like how ruby was shooting through the roof around 2009-2011. There is likely a huge install base of java/c++/other language code and active work in other languages being done which isn't shared via github.;;
I wouldn't call it biased but it certainly isn't the whole picture, it only takes Github into account ;;
I don't really know much about web dev yet, I only know HTML/CSS and basic JavaScript and jQuery. But do you think using Javascript instead of Ruby on Rails will become more of a standard for the back end?;;
"This is a variation on a [pretty common question](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_which_programming_language_should_i_start_with.3F). If you go by the number of people who have 'starred' or 'watched' the Rails and Node projects on Github, Node has already surpassed Rails in popularity. I understand wanting to avoid betting on a losing horse, but the fact is the concepts and way of thinking you will learn while digging into any language and or framework will translate to most others. The better question is *what language/framework should I use for this next project?* That one has no obvious answer either, but you can factor in:

* What am I already a little familiar with?
* What has a lot of community resources (tutorials to follow, sample projects to ~~copy~~ adapt, people to ask help from, etc.)
* What ratio of *learning new things* to *actually building stuff* am I prepared to tolerate

Given that you have some exposure to JS and jQuery, the gentlest learning curve might be to stick with that. You can always pick up Rails when the right project comes along (say, a collaborative one where it is already being used and there are lots of other devs who can help you).";;
"You can write back end code in JavaScript using node.js.

But you can do back end code in a whole host of programming languages, most of which are rather more pleasant to write than JavaScript (Python, for instance).

The justification for doing back-end code in JavaScript is not having to learn more than one language, and being able to share code between the front and back end.

The justification for not doing back-end code in JavaScript is that JavaScript is a horrible necessity on the front-end and you have a wider choice on the back-end.

"Sorry, don't grok the question. Why is *what* needed?

Why is Node.js needed? I'm not sure it is. It lets JavaScript programmers write code and run it outside of the browser.";;
Ah no i meant the client side sorry, as in why JavaScript is seemingly the only one used for that. I guess HTML and CSS are both pretty standard too, but when one gets to back end stuff there are suddenly loads more language choices (or so it seems);;
"Well, they are like layers:

* HTML is the document.
* CSS is the way the document is styled.
* JavaScript changes how the document behaves in the browser.

If you've done it right, each layer sits nicely on top of the one before. If the JavaScript doesn't load, you can still read the content on the page just without whatever fancy functionality was needed. If the CSS doesn't load, you can still read the page, just without the nice colours and fonts.

There could theoretically end up being other languages used in client-side web development, but JavaScript is used for it because that's what the browsers support. The introduction of [WebAssembly](https://www.w3.org/community/webassembly/) may make it so one could have other languages run in the browser. And there are the compile-to-JavaScript languages too—CoffeeScript, DART, TypeScript, Scala.js, Opal etc. But JavaScript is the one that is used because it is the one in the browser.";;
Cool cheers, it seems as though it just is what it is then. If browsers had implemented lisp we'd use that, or python we'd use that. Rather than there being some kind of technology provided via JavaScript that isn't available with others;;
Ok this looks cool as fuck... but what am I looking at? How do I understand this? Is this showing the popularity and decline of languages over the years? Or the updates and hacks being created for and added to each language over the years? I'm starting with ruby and then going for app academy here in NY but not before I already have something built and am at intermediate level already. Overkill I know but there acceptance rate is sub 10% From there I was thinking about picking up PHP next... but open to advice from experienced programmers.;;
"Everyone saying it's *not* a ""must"" is imagining hypothetical scenarios where you create a website that looks like it's from the 90s.

If you're creating anything approaching a modern website, and you don't have another developer doing the front end for you, you *have* to learn JavaScript. Period.

Actually, you could avoid learning JavaScript by learning a language that *compiles* to JavaScript (e.g. Coffeescript, Typescript, etc.) but thanks to the Law of Leaky Abstractions, you'll end up needing/wanting to know JavaScript anyway.";;
Technical answer, no. Logical answer, yes. It's like asking can I build a car without learning how to shape and fabricate metal? Could you technically do it? Yes, but it'd be one clunky POS. ;;
It's like saying, can I build a house with only 2x4's? Sure you could, but you probably want some plywood.;;
It's like saying, can I clean my teeth without toothpaste? Sure you could, but be prepared for tedious brushing.;;
[deleted];;
what the fuck?;;
"It's like saying ""can I make a comment using only shiivan's thought process"" and the answer is yes you can, but it won't get many upvotes.";;
It's like making a joke with rape, sure you can do it but it won't be funny.;;
"Everyone else is saying you do not have to, but you should. I am going to came and say that if you want to build a modern Website, the answer is yes you do have to learn Javascript. I can promise you that there is not a single site you use on a daily basis that does not use Javascript (reddit included). 

That being said, jQuery is a great place to get started. It lets you do a lot of the DOM manipulation that you need. In fact, if you do not want to dig heavy in to Javascript, just learn jQuery and you will be set. 

Source: I work every day as a Software Developer and I primarily work on Websites. I would be severely crippled at my company if I could not do Javascript.";;
"I agree with this.  Javascript is optional in the same way that wheels on your car are optional.

My follow up point is this: Despite the shit javascript gets from the older crowd, it's a very capable language.  It's also hugely popular.  You're doing yourself a real disservice by refusing to learn it.
";;
It really is. Any basic coding I do, I always choose between Javascript or Python. Usually it depends on which has the best libraries to aid me in what I want to do. ;;
jQuery: JavaScript training wheels. (And a good place to start!);;
jQuery taught me to love JavaScript.;;
Have to; no. It's perfectly possible to make a web application that's fully rendered on the back-end through RoR for example. However; not knowing any JS will hinder you because you really want to at least validate user input on the client side.
Are there any other workable alternatives to JS for the user input side of things? ;;
There's stuff like TypeScript that compiles to JS, but you still need JS knowledge.;;
"I have to disagree with this.  If you're doing modern web development, the holy trinity is js, css, and html.  You need all three.

Rendering on the back end limits you to websites that look like they're from the 90's.  No updating without refresh, no dynamic sizing, no client side validation or user interactions.  

It's like saying ""can I write a book without the letter 'E'?"".  You could, but you probably shouldn't.";;

>___Gadsby___ is a [1939](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1939_in_literature) novel by [Ernest Vincent Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Vincent_Wright). The plot revolves around the dying fictional city of Branton Hills, which is revitalized as a result of the efforts of [protagonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protagonist) John Gadsby and a youth group he organizes.

>The novel is written as a [lipogram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipogram) and does not include words that contain the letter ""e"". Though self-published and little-noticed in its time, the book is a favourite of fans of [constrained writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing) and is a sought-after rarity among some book collectors. Later editions of the book have sometimes carried the alternative subtitle *50,000 Word Novel Without the Letter ""E""*. In 1968, the novel entered the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) in the United States due to failure to renew copyright in the 28th year after publication.

"There are compile-to-javascript languages like CoffeeScript and Script#.

They will help you write *less* JavaScript, but you usually have to fill in the gaps with some handwritten stuff.

Javascript isn't that complex. Just remember to use === instead of == and you'll do fine.";;
Great thanks a lot! I heard that the fundamentals are easy but that it is a nightmare to maintain code in it esp as the site gets bigger, or if you are maintaining legacy code so I got a bad impression of it from that. Can you recommend a course that teaches html, css and JS simultaneously, or am I better off doing html and css on their own first?;;
Managing large projects in dynamic langauges can be hard, but you can use Typescript as uutrecht suggested and also take advantage of the [ES6 module and class system](http://eviltrout.com/2014/05/03/getting-started-with-es6.html) which is coming^soon^TM;;
With transpilers, [now](http://babeljs.io/)!;;
I understand babel also has support for Flow which, if you already know JS, and just want typing is pretty great. ;;
[EVERYTHING'S AN OBJECT!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StTqXEQ2l-Y);;
You should really check out Typescript, there's a course on Edx on TypeScript, too.;;
">== is same value

>=== is same value and type

Right?";;
"No. Double-equal attempts to coerce the two operands to the same type before performing the comparison. The comparison that is performed after the type coercion will behave the same as triple-equals.

An example:

    function foo(bar, baz){
        this.foo = bar;
        this.qux = baz;
    }
    foo.prototype.toString = function(){return ""quux"";};
    var f = new foo(1,2);
    f == 'quux'; // => true
    f === 'quux'; // => false

Here the value of `f` cannot be said to be `""quux""` in any fashion. But since we have thus specified the way in which it is to be converted to a string, loose equality will nevertheless return `true` here.

Edit: Also, 'value' has a specific meaning in computing, and even aside from the sort of thing in the example above, loose equality still isn't comparing by value. `1` simply does not have the same value as `""1""`.";;
Quality explanation, thanks a lot.;;
learn jQuery it's SO EASY;;
no;;
"I disagree. It would be like building a car without understanding how to weld metal. Yes you ""can"" make a car by gluing and nailing pieces together, but the result won't be roadworthy.";;
"Web developping analogy - building a house. 

HTML is the structure, the pipelines, the walls, the roof 

Javascrpit is making sure doors open, water and electricity flows. 

Css is putting the furiniture In the right place, pictures and wallpapers decorating the way they should. 

You are going to need that for making a basic interactible web site. And then you ll need more, like php., for example. But for now focus on those. ";;
Yes. ;;
"If you want to do front-end development, you should know how to use JavaScript.

If you want to do front-end development that's accessible and rational, you should know how to not *over*use JavaScript.

Sadly, there's a lot of people who satisfy the former requirement and not enough who satisfy the latter. There's a lot you can do with just HTML and CSS, and as the web platform evolves, there'll be even more you can do with HTML and CSS.

Animation? Once you needed Flash. Then you could use canvas/SVG+JS, but now you can use CSS animations.

To learn how to do JavaScript *well*, read up on progressive enhancement, universal design, and feature detection. The alternative to this is barmy, overengineered JavaScript frameworks. Nasty.

We have content sites—newspaper sites etc.—where there's 2-3 megabytes of JavaScript being downloaded to display a 20K article. That's insanity. Don't contribute to it. Use JavaScript sparingly and sanely.";;
Great advice. I was actually going to ask if you could build a news site without JS if say comments aren't enabled, and it is all display?;;
"Yep. And it's the best way to do it.

You don't even need JavaScript for comments. WordPress and so on doesn't need JavaScript for comments: it's only because people are using things like Disqus that you'd need JavaScript.";;
thanks again dude. Just wondering what would you use to enable and manage comments in the online news site context, if not JS? ;;
You'd just build it into the back-end. HTML and a form to write a new comment.;;
wow, didnt imagine you could handle that through backend! thanks a lot for sharing your knowledge. had no idea this thread would have so many responses, and so many good ones at that.;;
There was a time before JavaScript started being massively overused.;;
Yes!!!;;
"Short answer, as others have pointed out, is yes. Long answer requires a bit of background. 

Up until a few years ago, the web generally worked like this:

    [Browser] Hey, Webserver. Give me the page called tellmeajoke.html.
    [Server] Sure thing, let me just get a joke from the database and wrap it in a nice page for you. It's got everything: stats, comments, some ads... It really is a very nice page.
    [Browser] Sure, whatever. Hey, I want to vote for this joke. I'll click this button.
    [Server] Cool, that button takes you to a page that tells me you want to vote for joke number 42. So noted. Now here's the joke page again, but with one more vote! Neat, huh? Maybe you want to write a comment too?
    [Browser] Nah, I'm good. I'm gonna go browse SomethingAwful instead.
    [Server] But I made you the page and everything...

In this example, the server is a piece of software that constructs complete web pages, and sends them to the browser. The browser waits for the user to click a link, which prompts it to request another complete page from the server. Rinse, repeat. Fast forward to today:

    [Browser] Hey, webserver, tell me a joke.
    [Server] Sure. Here's a pretty joke page, and a few buttons to click. I'll give you the joke in a sec.
    [Browser] No probs, I'll just draw the page while I wait. Also, looks like I need to load a font from another site. I'll get right on that.
    [Server] Cool. Here's the joke!
    [Browser] Heh, that's kinda funny. I'll keep track of what the user's up to, and make sure he doesn't write any dirty words in the comment field.
    [Server] All good, man. Just let me know when you have something, k?
    [Browser] Sure, bro.
    
    ...Time passes...
    
    [Server] Hey, you know that joke you're looking at? It's got two more votes and a comment. Here they are.
    [Browser] Ah, gotcha. I'll just redraw this, change this to that... Oh, and the user just voted for this joke.
    [Server] Excellent. I'll put it in the database.
    [Browser] Sounds good to me, buddy.

So, the key here is that the client is doing almost all of the work -- it only needs a few basic things from the server, and occasionally send some data back. You leverage the pretty impressive technology that is a modern web browser to react to clicks, move stuff around on the screen, and make various calculations on data *you already have,* only talking to the server when we really need to. This keeps things fast -- and scalable.

Now, a webserver can be written in any language it damn well pleases, but in the browser, you really only have one option: Javascript. For historical reasons, this is the only language web browsers understand. 

So, learn it. 

Then go check out [Meteor](http://www.meteor.com), because that is how you write web apps like a boss.";;
"You have to learn vowels to read.

It's like that.";;
"Short answer: yes. 

Long answer: I won't hire you if the position says UI or UX and you don't know Javascript, even if I forgot to put it in the job description. It's like saying you need to be able to use email to work as a secretary. It should go without saying these days. 

But I understand it's not necessary,technically. It's just that not necessary does not also mean practical. ";;
"Let me tell you what the guy who taught me .NET/IIS development told me, which was absolutely true when it came time to go job hunting:
 
""Once you're in the job, you might spend all day every day with C#, or you might be a DBA optimising SQL, or you might work server profiling and marketing with R - even in companies who only use those languages it doesn't matter. Nobody hiring for web development is going to put you past the first minute of resume culling unless you know PHP and Javascript""
 
It's almost funny how companies who shit on PHP on a regular basis (for good reason, PHP is [9 kinds of shit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lolphp)) still look for it on a resume. Javascript though is becoming one of those 'fingers in every pie' kind of deals, whether it's .NET, J2EE, Django/Flask,  everybody and their dog is doing server hit mitigation with Javascript (you can lower your server hits by having the end user's machine do partway validation with javascript, and have the server only do final/fail-fast validation) at the very least.";;
I've literally never seen a company I was interested in want PHP. Some suggested having primarily PHP experience was a mark against a candidate. ;;
Yeah, my last two web jobs were C# and Scala. In fact, PHP seems pretty unpopular in my area. When I was looking for jobs, most of what I found was C#, Java, or Python.;;
"Never said primarily PHP, obviously if you're aiming for x language then they'll want x language experience. I also never said they advertise that they want it.
 
The way it was explained to me was PHP can be learned by an established developer in about an hour to a point you could whip up a website that did some stuff - if you've made it through the whole of uni/college without doing so you must not give a crap. That and the people in charge of sorting resumes are usually not technical people, they just have a list of target points.";;
"At the very least you'll want to add jquery to your html and css learning. It's not that hard and extremely powerful. You'll pick it up quick and enjoy it.

edit: jquery";;
How does one go about learning jQuery without learning JavaScript?;;
You really don't, unless you stick to the out-of-the-box functions. If you start customizing things with object notation, declaring variables, and looping through things, which you can do during the course of using jQuery, knowing the JavaScript syntax will make jQuery make much more sense. This is especially true if you use jQuery for Asynchronous requests.;;
Interesting. How does one declare a variable in the jQuery language?;;
"jQuery is not a language; it's a JavaScript library. Somebody wrote an object called jQuery which has a bunch of methods. Without getting too much into its history or everything it's useful for, suffice it to say that jQuery is still JavaScript. So if you have zero understanding of events, the kinds of events that exist, and how to use event handlers/event listeners, you'll have a tough time coming up with new ways to solve a problem; you'll always need someone to spoon feed you the answer to very simple questions. See below.

        var $main = $('#main');
        
        $main.on('mouseover mouseleave', highlight);
        
        $main.on('click', function(evt) {
            $main.off('mouseover mouseleave', highlight);
            $main.html('<p>You shut off the hover effect.</p>');
            $main.removeClass('highlight');
        });
        
        function highlight(evt) {
            $main.toggleClass('highlight');
    }

**Edit:** Another example, using objects

    // create node
    $('<h2></h2>', {
        text: 'Hello from JavaScript',
        class: 'myClass'
    }).appendTo('article');";;
Yes, I know that jQuery is not a language. That is my point. It's being discussed here as an alternative to JavaScript. It is not. It's a utility library and nothing more. If you don't know JavaScript, you can't use jQuery. So, please, don't tell people in a learning sub that jQuery is a viable alternative to learning JavaScript.;;
"I think what they mean is that you can use jQuery as a pretty much standalone thing without having to learn all that much about JS beforehand.

As a way to be able to quickly make cool things happen on a page, jQuery is great and doesn't require a ton of knowledge of JS, and it greatly streamlines DOM manipulation (what most beginning front end devs are most interested in) over vanilla JS.

I mean, to create a new `li` element on a `ul` in vanilla JS you have to do:

    var newLi = document.createElement('li');
    var newTxt = document.createTextNode('stuff');
    newLi.appendChild(newTxt);
    var list = document.getElementById('ul');
    list.appendChild(newLi);

but in jQuery, you'd just have to go:

    $(function(){
        $('ul').append(""<li>stuff</li>"");
    }

    ";;
I wasn't doing that, and I agree with you. I wasn't sure whether you were being facetious although I had an inkling. ;;
"Cargo cult programming, e.g. assuming that $ is some magic operator in JavaScript.

It might be similar to the people who know rails, but not ruby (and so don't know what to do when they suddenly find themselves in a situation where none of [these methods](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/Object.html) seem to exist in their environment.)";;
"5 years ago, I would have agreed with you.  Unless you absolutely need to target IE8, I would no longer recommend using jQuery.  

If you already know jQuery, knock yourself out, it's a handy timesaver.  If you're just starting, it's just one more layer you have to understand and properly use to get up and running.

HTML5, ECMA5.1+, and CSS3 really remove the requirement to throw jQuery at every problem.  The native methods are cross platform, far faster, and usually just as capable.  

You will spend a little bit more time typing though...";;
"The other answers are all fine but I don't think they get to the point. JavaScript is probably the most common tool in web development so there is no reason to shy away from it. I would guess that 90% of sites if not more use it in some way. In programming, there are tons of tools to choose from for almost any job and you could avoid JavaScript if you wanted to but it is probably counter productive.

You really only need html and css to build a static website. And much of the simple stuff you would need to do with JavaScript you should be able to fumble through without actually having to learn to much if you don't want to invest the time (by re-useing code on the internet).";;
Codeacademy.com is a good free site to learn some basic JS. They offer other coding languages as well. I use it to keep myself familiar with coding while I'm not currently in a position where I use it very much.;;
Spend a good amount of time learning Javascript *first* and then find a good compile-to-js language that you enjoy using. Skipping the 'learn JS' part and going straight to a compile-to-js will probably hurt you in the long run.;;
yes, you need to know javascript, because that's the language used by the web browsers.  so unless you don't need the browser to do anything (other than rendering your markup) you do need to know javascript.;;
"Learn Javascript. There is no point in being a web developer without knowing it. It is the language of the browser. It is a bitch at first, but once you get the hang of its nuances, it is awesome for those reasons. I used to hate it, now I love it.

My suggestion is play with it, have it drive you crazy, learn how to use it.

Perhaps after you read the good parts then you can go back and pick up all the other parts here: https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS;;
I took a week-long course with the author of You Don't Know JS. It was really great to see how the internals of js work. ;;
YES.;;
You really should learn it, yes.  It's very very popular and for good reason.;;
It's good to have a well rounded arsenal of programming languages under your belt. JavaScript is not going anywhere anytime soon so you should at least learn the basics. This will only help you get (and keep) web dev jobs! Good luck!;;
For now, yes. As web assembly (wasm) comes online and tools are built, in the near future (say 5 years) you should be able to target the web using your favourite language.;;
No but yes.;;
Have? No. Should? Yes.;;
Yes. You should familiarize yourself with the role it plays and the general syntax. You don't have to become an expert though but it is a large part of web dev. ;;
Well, you could just learn Dart and Dart has a Jquery library I think.;;
If you're learning web development with the aim of producing websites, then no don't learn pure JavaScript, it will put you off, because it is a horribly verbose language. Instead  learn a JavaScript api like JQuery.;;
Unless you plan to work strictly on the backend, where a high-performance language like Java is used, JavaScript is essential for making interactive, modern websites.;;
It is really important to learn. Not only is it becoming more and more popular, but also knowing HTML and CSS and not Javascript would be like knowing how to build car without knowing how the engine works.;;
eugh, whot. still learn javascript? from what year are your books from? ;;
What technologies do you recommend for web development?;;
"In case this dude doesn't answer here's my 2c: For work I use ASP .net (C#) and boat load of Javascript on the client side. At a minimum I use JQuery and mostly I try to use frameworks like AngularJS or Knockout for larger apps as they make Javascript development much easier and far more effective.

Personally I use [Node](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013ode-express-mongo/) (Javascript server) and on the client side I've been toying with ReactJS bundled with Webpack but I'd recommend you try [AngularJS](http://www.airpair.com/angularjs/building-angularjs-app-tutorial). [modern web development is about javascript](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/the-birth-and-death-of-javascript) one way or the other.";;
Unequivocally yes. Knowing at least *some* javascript is 100% required. ;;
Yes.;;
No. it's not a MUST. BUT, you will be going about things the very hard way. and if you're even half serious about learning web development you will end up learn javascript at some point that's for certain.;;
No. Javascript needs to die. It is completely unsecured. Stop using it.;;
This is so wrong it's hilarious.;;
There is a reason why TOR and I2P disable javascript. ;;
"lol that's nothing to do with ""unsecured"".";;
It is a client side. It is easily be injected with malicious scripts from man in the middle. ;;
This is so painfully laughable ;;
"So can your HTML.... So can your Windows Update....

Yes, when using 3rd party untrusted routes, you don't want to execute code that comes through. Not much to do with javascript being good or bad.";;
I don't use windows.  Linux master race. ;;
"So? Oh your Linux distro repo isn't the same right?

You run `apt-get upgrade` while on a 3rd party untrusted route?

Linux won't automagically make you ""secure"" if you don't understand it.";;
Not if you SSL/SSH tunnel to the official repos. ;;
"You've taken the time to do that have you?

I'd hazard a guess that if you look in your `/etc/apt/sources.list` you'll see `http`.

These are pretty much beginners books. You have more than 4 years contact with Java, I would read more in depth books about algorithms. ;;
To be fair, Effective Java is pretty comprehensive. Pragmatic Programmer and Algorithm Design Manual are more general books, and yes I agree which is why I've also requested any suggestions for other highly recommended books that will get me up to par in other big languages used currently. My 4 years with Java is also very shallow - the way it was covered at Uni was sub-par (in my opinion), and the issue I have with my current job is most of the issues I run across are environmental or product oriented - I'm not pushing and learning new things about the language or other programming skills which is why I also feel the need to still cover some Java using Effective Java. Some of those books are also in almost every single top 10 programming books to read lists (i.e. The Pragmatic Programmer) so I don't think they are all just beginner books. Hope this clarifies why I've chosen the books I've got.;;
Sometimes when you can't find something on Google it's because you are using the wrong keywords. If you give example of your search queries I could tell you if they're good enough to return results or show you another way to write it.;;
The way you phrased that makes me think that just learning how to properly use google's search function may be the best first step in learning programming.  The basic baby steps.  The stuff some people came here for.  I'm typing this for a friend, btw;;
"The best step at learning programming is programming while reading documentation and Google is great for finding what you're looking for.

For example: If you're searching how to pretty print JSON in Python your search keywords will be `Python`, `JSON` and `pretty print` (not `pretty printing`), but there is no need to research by writing a query such as `""Python"" AND ""JSON"" AND ""pretty print""` so there's not much too learn except using the right keywords and keeping it simple. The more you had the more you filter.

The first result will be the best answer if your keywords are right: https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html  
In case you want Python 3 you can change that on the site directly or append `3` to `Python` when you search.

What you can't really learn by searching on Google is stuff you never heard about. If you're getting into C and you want to use a loop to execute a function only if it meets some requirements such as:

	'+' => add(int a, int b)
	'-' => sub(int a, int b)
	'*' => mul(int a, int b)
	'/' => div(int a, int b)

You can do that with an ""array of function pointers"", but unless you hear about this concept and those words you won't be able to do much research on it. But since Google knows everything I might be wrong.

When people ask you to read a man it's not because you're annoying them or because they just want to be rude to you, they are actually telling you what you should do to learn what you want to do and reading a man before asking for anything is required so you can discuss and ask for help while understanding what people are telling you.

**TL;DR**: Google points you where you want to go only if you know where you want to go.";;
  I understand your TL;DR, and that's my malfunction.  HOW DO I FIGGUR OUT WERE TO GO??  This is *something that a google tutorial in the sidebar faq or whatnot might help with?*  Seriously; and I mean *seriously* (the formatting help is actually helping me understand things) there are people looking for basic help here.  Basic help.  About how to google.  I'm ready to take the hit of internhate that I'm going to get for posting this, but **google basics** seems like it would fit in well with a collection of people that may not know much about how to relate with something as simple as a token/function/variable as seen in a programming/coding/whatevernment.  This is a learning environment, right?  No wrong questions?  I would like to ask my own questions to a robot and receive a dozen possibly correct answers due to my correct use of a search engine than have to wait 12 hours for someone to tell me I'm not looking the right way.  **Knowing how to Use Google With Proper Search Syntax May Keep That Learning Ball Rolling** 
"/u/SenpaiSilver makes an incredible point:

> Google points you where you want to go only if you know where you want to go.

Regardless of any ""Google basics"" or search awesomeness or spice you add to something, there's a good chance it's not going to help you out on things that you are completely oblivious to. Sure, it could help sometime, but when you can't put it a keyword on something specific, it's not going to help out your search.

That being said, searching and scanning is your best friend. If you don't know what the better keywords are for a search, then just put what sounds close, and use those search results to figure out better keywords. If you come across something incredibly relevant, bookmark it. If I search something that I'm not sure how to do, I open just about every result on the search page and read every page. I may even do this for 3-4 pages of tabs. If you can't find anything there, try reworking your search with an alternative keyword.

Lastly, Google isn't the only place to search. It will get you to a lot of places when you know the keywords, but if you can't find anything, it's worth it to focus looking in a specific area. Instead of googling something, look for it specifically on GitHub or StackOverflow.

If that doesn't work, then come here, or go to some kind of chat room. Say ""I am trying to do X put I don't know how to put it into words"".

I get stuck Googling all the time. It get's better with time because your knowledge increases with time.

Also, if you ""can't wait 12 hours for an answer"" then go pay someone at codementor or something to get an instant answer. Free help shouldn't have a time limit.";;

"I suspect it's going to be hard to find a good tutorial -- from what I can tell, most guides tend to teach how to use more advanced features of google.

If you can PM me a bunch of examples of search queries you've been trying from your search history (so I can compare how you use google vs how I use google), I can try writing a guide myself (if I detect a systemic difference between how you google vs how I google), or just write you several tips and tricks if it turns out that the only difference is minor things.

"How to properly Google isn't an unreasonable request.  Part of my computer classes in high school 10 years ago taught us how to search, back when search engines were terrible.

Anyway, not providing a link, but at least wanted to let you know you're not crazy.  People ITT seem to be taking Google search for granted, and you have a legitimate request.  For example, I believe you can add a minus sign in front of a word to omit those results, and you can encase strings in quotes to ensure it finds both in order.  For example, *fire truck* will search for both *fire* and *trucks,* while ""fire truck"" will match both in order. ";;
Sorry, I didn't realize you were telling everyone how humble you are so they know that's what you're doing.;;
"I don't know what you don't know, so here are some *very simple* tips for Googling as a programmer.

When you get an error message:

- Start by copy-pasting the entire message into the search bar. See if that gets you something useful.
- Otherwise, try to pick out the part of the message that doesn't change, and Google that. For example, maybe you get something like ""failed to load file. 109876 kb required, but only 99654 kb available."". The numbers (and perhaps the units) are likely different from message to message. Try Googling just the other parts. Add keywords such as the library/API or compiler that you're using, and the function/method names that you are calling.
- If that fails, you should probably have a look at the documentation. There should either be one place where all the error messages and types are described, or else the description of the particular methods you are using may describe the possible errors.
- If you *still* can't figure it out, try posting a question on StackOverflow. Someone will probably be a dick about your post being a repost, or not constructive, but at least that'll probably point you towards the correct post.

Also, what exactly do I mean when I tell you to find ""something useful""? Examples include:

- A StackOverflow (or similar) post describing the why the problem happens. Use this to avoid making the problem happen.
- A blog post describing the process of finding the problem. Use this to either fix your problem, or find a way around it.
- A bug report describing the problem. If it's fixed, find out what version of the software you need to upgrade to. If it's not fixed, look through the comments to see if there is a workaround, and use that.

One more thing: The tutorial you are looking for may be how to **debug**, not how to Google. Try looking up a some tutorials on debugging.";;

"There is nothing wrong with asking Reddit questions, that's what these forums are FOR. A big hurdle in learning how to program is the programming terms, methodologies, commonly used phrases, and just context in general. People are going to have a much easier time deciphering what you want than Google or any search engine is for, if you're brand new.

If you were new programming, how would you find an easy answer to this.

e.g. I want to find all odd numbers in an array and make them go highest to lowest? A newbie will need to know a quite a bit just to get this done.

Knowing the correct terminology will help tremendously with this question, otherwise the Google results will be way to vague. Words like ""Sort array, ascending, index, item, object"" would help, plus knowing how to use operators, which a lot of newbies don't know will help.

"The easiest possible thing I can think of is a USB or Bluetooth action button:

The advantage of something like this is that you don't need to write any code to hook it up - just plug it in or pair it using bluetooth, then use the included software to program the button to do something that your app can detect trivially - like simulate a key press, or something like that.

"The two options you suggested above actually sound perfectly reasonable and I'd highly recommend trying the ""spawn a process"" approach to start out just because it's so simple, would work with any language, and would make testing the C++/Java component in isolation easy.

See the [Node Foreign Function Interface](https://github.comode-ffiode-ffi) for one easy way to create these bindings, but it's also possible to write the bindings yourself at a lower level. The main downside to this approach is that it wouldn't work with a language like Java, you'd have to use C++.

"Summing an array is hard to parallelize because the speed will depend mostly on how quickly the CPU can load the array from memory. Summing is so fast that spreading it across two cores is unlikely to speed things up and will probably just slow things down.

Convolution sounds like a great thing to try parallelizing.

My suggestion would be something like this:

1. Write a convolution function and write a unit test for it so you know it's correct.

2. Split the convolution into two function calls - one on the first half of the data, one on the second half, then combine the results and check that you get the same answer. Write a test for this too, before bothering to do the threaded part.

3. Now learn to use pthread_create to spawn a new thread. Call pthread_create twice, one for each half of the convolution.

4. After calling pthread_create twice, call pthread_join twice - the ""main"" thread will just wait until both worker threads finish. You're done!

If the two threads write to non-overlapping memory, this should basically work. If you want to deal with interaction between threads, you'd need to then learn about mutexes, semaphores, and condition variables - but luckily you should be able to get by without them in the example above as long as you're okay with spawning worker threads that don't interact with one another in any way then waiting for all of them to finish.

Looks correct. You may have set the `-std=c++11` option incorrectly in the IDE. Double check where you entered it. There may also be a checkbox to indicate c++11 that you can just check, instead of typing in a raw commandline argument.;;

"If you write a foreach loop of the form `for(var prop in obj)`, you should use the `prop` property in some way.  (Otherwise, your loop is worthless.)

Since objects are essentially key-value pairs, the loop gives you the key.  In other words, `prop` is the key, and therefore `obj[prop]` is the value.";;

It's not a very good idea for a company to take a clean CRM installation and throw a newbie at it, and expect ANYTHING to come from it for a long time. They should've gotten help from someone who actually knows CRM, and has set it up before.

You should definetly try to find other people who are experienced in CRM, and reach out to them for best-practice and general advice on how to go about it.

I'm not trying to shit on your situation, i'm just being honest, since i have been in a similar situation myself (albeit with a lot stronger programming background and a couple of months experience on a big CRM project).

The key point is to not get carried away and promising the world. Be very critical of what people request. It's okay to say no, as long as you can explain why (it helps to have alternative suggestions, that accomplish what the REALLY wanted in the first place).

Remember, you're now the expert, and they should respect that you are the expert. Don't let them bully you into making the CRM ugly and messy (""but it works!"").";;
Well it's being set up and developed by a consulting firm, but of course they won't be showing me any of the back end. ;;
"Deploying to a CRM production instance without any prior knowledge of this business application is the first ingredient of a disaster.

You need to be trained by partners who knows CRM first or get certified and get at least 1-3 months of experience on the solution before starting.

I'm not designing it,  we have a consultation firm doing the development, I'm just the primary liason and will be the admin once the project is completed. I don't need to be able to develop, but I wish to learn to do so. ;;
"Good, make sure they follow the SDK and don't make stupid design decisions with customization. The XRM platform is extremely powerful when it's used properly.

"Haven't done much CRM work since 2011 but I found the documentation on [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh547453.aspx) pretty useful. Granted my work was heavily geared towards writing applications which integrated with CRM rather than implementing workflows/business rules within the application so YMMV.
If you do plan on writing a lot of code I would definitely read through the overview section and make sure you check out some of the best practices guides - it might not make sense immediately but hopefully will trigger when you find yourself heading down the wrong path later. 
Other worthwhile sections would be those covering client application extensions, generating early bound classes and writing plugins / workflow libraries. Should be plenty to get you started. 

Also, if you haven't already found it, the [SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44567) download package contains heaps of development tools you'll need (or at least you used to), as well as code samples so worth checking that out too.

I'm pretty sure they still do free trials of CRM Online which can be useful if you're just mucking around. Spin up a trial, create some custom entities and start building apps to mess them up. If you go too far wrong just export customisations, nuke the trial and try again.

I was not privy to the specifics.;;

"HTML isn't capable of this. 

You need to use a backend language like PHP and a database like MySQL if you wish to store the answers.

[Basic Form Handling in PHP](http://www.the-art-of-web.com/php/form-handler/)";;
What about cookies and local storage (HTML 5)?  I am sure this would answer what the op is asking.;;
Localstorage is local to the client.  What a single client sees will be available to that client again in the future, but no others. If you want to store data so that others will be able to see it, you need some type of server-side technology. PHP is the most common here, although Python is gaining popularity.  It is possible to do JavaScript on the server (Node.js) but it is really a different kind of programming.;;
"Well I guess then he has a choice between using local information for passing text between pages for a particular client, as the op asked originally, or we can expand that for all clients that can interact with each other and start using some form of SQL or nosql database on the backend.

Once again, I was not addressing ops question, but the fact that you minimized his request into a statement about HTML alone basically and then mentioned he might have to use other technologies other than just HTML, which all of us in the development world would have implicitly implied once the words ""blog from scratch"" were said. Which is why I pointed out at a minimum you could use just JavaScript and local storage to accomplish exactly what op is asking, as opposed to telling him what won't work and not really giving any direction at all.

If I were to answer him, I would have mentioned, frontend, backend, and middleware at a minimum, and possibly pointed him towards some open source frameworks already built in his language of choice for what he is attempting to do.  Once again I apologize for the misinterpretation.  My fault is that when having development related discussions with developers, I assume we all understand the basics and don't have to have explanatory discussions about full stack and the roles of each layer within the stack, which is what you are attempting to do here.";;
"HTML alone is not suitable for a blog, and neither is JavaScript as it is normally used.  While the localstorage mechanism is part of the HTML standard, it (like many of the important parts of HTML5) is actually a part of JavaScript.  And although localstorage does technically save content on the client side, it has limitations that make it entirely unsuitable for use as a blog.

In /r/learnprogramming, it's safe to assume that the OP is trying to learn programming.  A question like this implies a very common misunderstanding - that HTML alone is enough to solve problems which also require some kind of programming language.

The point of /r/learnProgramming is to help beginners.  
If you're implying we should assume they already know about programming, I'm not sure what we're doing here.

If you're upset that I didn't go into a longer description of how client / server programming works, I don't know what to tell you.  I do know a little about such things (I've written a half-dozen books on the topic.)   Here we answer the question at hand (can I build a blog with HTML? Answer: No.)  If the response to that question raises another question (especially from the OP) then we go farther.  If the responders start sniping at each other, we've become stack overflow.  ";;
That's still a no. You need to use Javascript.;;
What's wrong with JavaScript?  Op made no mention of it being explicitly excluded.  My answer stands.;;
">What's wrong with JavaScript?

Nothing. HTML and Javascript are 2 separate things.

I'm just saying you can't do it with HTML alone. I probably could've written that comment a bit better.";;
Developing a blog implies multiple technologies as it will contain a rendering ui, backend to store data, commenting and rich text editing, so it would inherently imply all of this, especially doing so from scratch.  We are talking 2 different conversations here.  I mistook your statement of HTML alone being your main answer, even though op mentioned nothing about this.;;

"Software architecture & design. 

Programming one-off scripts, or even entire applications is all well and good, but the next logical step of any programmer is to start doing more than making code work. Code should also be:

1. Receptive to change (i.e. maintainable, flexible)
2. Secure
3. Efficient
4. Readable & understandable
5. Have clearly separated responsibilities (no god classes or spaghetti balls)
6. Usable & re-usable (clean, modular, and intuitive API)
7. Loosely coupled
8. Testable
9. Have unit and functional tests to prove it works and to make it possible to refactor without causing an avalanche of uncaught bugs.

Look into [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_%28object-oriented_design%29) and [GRASP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRASP_\(object-oriented_design\)) principles to start.

Also practice [object calisthenics](http://williamdurand.fr/2013/06/03/object-calisthenics/) if you're primarily programming in an object-oriented language (note that this term is misnamed - it's not going to help you write better object-oriented code, it's merely meant to help make your object-oriented syntax code easier to read). A good book to read is Clean Code by Robert Martin.

If you are programming in an object-oriented language, you ought to also dip your toes into functional programming - take Clojure out for a drive. The coming apocalypse is processors with hundreds or thousands of cores. If you want to handle multithreading in that kind of environment, functional programming is going to be your friend.";;
Any easy answer as to why functional will work better on computers with many cores? Just curious;;
"Objects encapsulate state, and state is difficult to share between threads without causing race conditions or ambiguity over which state is correct.

Functional programming doesn't (isn't supposed to) have state - it's just atomic operations on input that return output, usually in an order that doesn't matter (but this is up to your system design). 

So you can just distribute those computations and operations across cores/servers/clusters to achieve parallelization more easily.";;
"interesting! 

Is this something you think will (can?) be ironed out by the time we have consumer access to hundreds of cores or will people have to shift to more functional style to use it? 

I can't think of a use case (other than some serious video or number crunching) that would warrant having 100+ cores.

"Yes, sometimes you have to just make up work. If you're not taking programming classes or programming professionally, you have to find your own motivation. It's important to find something to work on, though. Just like any other skill or ability, if you don't use it, you lose it.

i'm sure you have plenty of ideas at this point - but i can also advise since you seem intelligent project euler which is math challenges. this should keep you actively thinking about finding solutions to problems while you deciding on the project.";;
Build your portfolio!  Make it a goal to build a new project every 3 months.  Also, work on open source projects on GitHub.  Then when you are old enough to go off to college, you can land a sweet programming gig on the side while you go to school.  Then you can start making some good money instead of working a typical college job which doesn't pay as well.

I live in the United States and there are very few colleges that I think would have a space on an application for including something like that. If the school requires an essay you might be able to slip it in...but it would be weird to have link in an essay. You would be better off applying to programming competitions and trying to win in order to discuss that experience in your college application essay. That would be better to talk about then dropping a link in my opinion. However, many job applications (like google, facebook, etc.) I have filled out ask for a github link. ;;

"/u/lightcloud5 was dead on with the invisible `arguments` explanation, but I don't think he totally answered all the questions you had about how 2 and 10 are both being passed in, so I'll give it a shot. 

What's happening the first time through? You're simply passing 1 argument, 2. `arguments.length` is now 1. It passes the first conditional of being a number, then passes the check for `argument.length` because it's length is not 2, so we move on to function `v`.

You aren't invoking `v` at first, just defining. As you can see it'll take an argument (`x`), and pass it along with your already verified number (from the first conditional), `num1` to call the add function once more. But when you call `v`, you're not invoking it, just returning it. So `add(2)` would return this function `v`... so you can kind of imagine just replacing `add(2)` with `v` at this point in the flow. Immediately after `v` is returned outside of the add function, it's being invoked like so `v(10)` (remember `num1` was already passed as the first invisible arg).

Then it passes all of the conditionals and returns the sum of the two! ";;
"Yes, it's because of the invisible `arguments` object.

`arguments` is similar to an array, and it contains all the arguments that are passed in.  This allows javascript functions to take in *arbitrarily many* arguments (much like `printf` in C).

For instance,

    var myFunction = function () {
        for (var i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) 
            console.log(""args["" + i + ""]: "" + arguments[i]);
    }

    myFunction(3, 4, 5);
    myFunction(""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"");

Javascript syntax is otherwise as you would expect.  Only 2 is passed into the function, because that's how you pass in one argument.

    add(2); // one argument

Passing in two arguments looks like this:

    add(2, 10); // two arguments

I don't know what's confusing about 3, but I rewrote your function call for you:

    var myFunction = add;
    var returnVal = myFunction(2);
    var myFinalOutput = returnVal(10);";;
"A closure is created the first go around. What that means is that the reference for num1 is stored within the scope of the add function. 

So if you imagine that calling add(2) returns a function(x) that takes a variable and calls add(2, x) you can trace it back the second set of parentheses is invoking the anonymous function assigned to v with the value of num1 in the closure. 

tldr: the first value is stored in the returned function which Is called with the second value.

Edit: one more attempt at an explanation...
break it down to the first function call and you get 

add(2) == function(x)  { return add(2, x);}

You are then essentially calling:
(function(x)  { return add(2, x);})(10)";;
"> How am I able to pass in the number 2 to this function that doesn't have parameters? Is it because of the invisible argument object?

JavaScript does not enforce [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity), which means that it's not an error if the number of formal parameters that you declare the function as taking does not match the number of arguments passed when the function is called.  Regardless of how many parameters you list in the function's signature, the `arguments` pseudo-array always contains all the arguments that were passed.

> How does it know to only pass in one number, 2, at the very beginning, and not both 2 and 10?

Here is the call site:

    add(2)(10);

This is two function calls, because there are two pairs of parentheses.  It's equivalent to:

    (add(2))(10);

Or, giving a name to the temporary value:

    var tmp = add(2);
    tmp(10);

`add` is called with a single argument, 2.  The value returned is a function.  That function is then called with the single argument 10.  The value returned by *that* function is the number 12.

> When I hit and return the function stored in variable v, how does that function know to take in 10 next for x? and not 2? 

Because that's how the call site was written.
";;
"Have you tried setting a breakpoint / stepping through it in a debugger to see what the values are set to as it runs? E.g. make sure `doc` is what you expect it to be, then `images`, etc.

Edit: an alternative to using a debugger would be to add some type of logging to your code.

A few issues that stand out: on r/aww the thumbnail is a link to the image, and the link text is aslo a link to the image. Your code doesn't differentiate them or check for duplicates, so you might try to get some images twice, and sometimes there's no link text (e.g. when the link is a thumbnail, or you might be trying to use a whole `img` tag as a filename, which wouldn't be very good)

You are saying `op = new FileOutputStream(...` but you never seem to write to it, you just close `in` and `op` after that; you probably have to write from `in` to `op` while both are open.

You'd need a different parser, but you can also request JSON format from reddit just by adding "".json"" to the URL: here's [r/aww as JSON.](https://www.reddit.com/r/aww.json)

"Use proper syntax (you may not make up your own syntax).

It's good that you're using the triple equals (`===` and `!==`).

In javascript, as in other programming languages, an expression is something that represents some value -- for instance, `3` is an expression (representing the value 3).

As in math, you can substitute one expression for an equivalent expression -- e.g. you can substitute `1+2` anywhere you see `3` because they are equivalent.

In javascript, given two expressions `a` and `b`, `a !== b` returns a boolean expression of `true` if and only if `a` and `b` are not equal.

So `userChoice !== ""rock""` would yield true if and only if `userChoice` is not the string `""rock""`.

Then, in javascript, given two boolean expressions `a` and `b`, `a` && `b` returns true if and only if both `a` and `b` are true.

For instance, `3 > a && 5 > b` yields true if and only if `a` is greater than 3 and `b` is greater than 5.

Also, in javascript, the comma operator is a valid operator, but I'd advise against using it.  It has its place (particularly in `for` loops), but as a general rule of thumb, you can avoid using commas in your code (outside of comments and within strings).  In any case, the comma certainly doesn't do what you want it to do in your case.";;
"Try this:

while ( userChoice != ""rock"" && userChoice != ""paper"" && userChoice != ""scissors"" ) {

"It isn't required (except in XHTML), but it's the recommended style. There are a lot of things in HTML that will work in most browsers even though they're not technically correct.

There are a few reasons you'd want to do it anyway. For one, text editors will correctly highlight attributes if you use quote marks, making things easier to quickly read. For another, if you don't use quotemarks, you can't use certain characters within your attributes. What if you wanted to write `style=div > a {something}`? The `>` would close the tag. So you'd wind up having to use quotes sometimes, but not other times, which is messy and a potential source of bugs. 

Most browsers will still work without the tags, most of the time. But some browsers won't and all will fail in special cases. Just use them all the time for the sake of simplicity and consistency.";;
HTML is a standard.  The reason it is taught a particular way is because that is what the standard says to do.  A browser can choose to interpret the text it receives any way it chooses, which is why a page may look different in Chrome than it does in Safari or IE.  Surrounding your element-level style attributes in quotes may not always be necessary, but there are situations where the inline CSS may use a character that could be reserved for another purpose that would cause the lexical parser of the browser to render that block incorrectly.;;
"It doesn't work in Chrome.  The HTML standard does not allow you to put spaces in your style tag without the enclosing quotes.

Also, not having quotation marks makes escaping the content much, much harder, if the content is user-generated.";;
"[Here's the standard](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#attributes-2).  Attribute values do not require quotes as long as they don't contain spaces, single or double quotes, equals sign, less than sign, greater than sign, or the grave accent (aka backtick.)  Otherwise they must be quoted, either with single or double quotes.

So these are all legal:

    <div class=extraLarge>
    <a href=http://example.com/>
    <p style=font-size:50px>

Your example is not legal, because the attribute value contains a space.  The fact that one browser accepts it does not change that.

"It might help if you explained what clipconverter is, as not everyone here will know it.

I'm assuming it's some kind of site that converts media files into other formats?

I that case you need the following steps:

* Make a list of the format conversions you want to support. 
* First you need code to do the actual conversions. You likely don't want to write those from scratch, so look for libraries and tools.
* Forget about the website for now, get it working standalone first. Write code that uses the library or tool that you picked and converts a file that's already on local disk to the desired format
* Next write a web frontend where people can upload the media files. Alternatively they might enter a URL where the file is retrieved from.
* Hook the web frontend up to your converter so that the file gets converted after the upload is complete.
* After the conversion is complete, offer the converted file for download to the user. ";;

"[JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json) is useful for structured data. For console history, JSON might be overkill. A simple log file will do just fine.

JSON is useful for storing data from objects. Like if you had a bunch of car objects with many different attributes. It makes it easy to parse the data and load it back into your app.

A console history is much simpler. You would typically only have a timestamp and the output. Making using JSON kind of pointless. The log file is easy enough to parse already.

>What are the advantages of using JSON files as a ""database"" instead of a proper mySQL implementation.?

Apples and oranges. A MYSQL database is a service and JSON is a text file. They fulfill completely different needs. A database will give you a ton of tools to manipulate and store data.

All JSON does is store data for use. It can't do anything with it.";;
"I see, so if I understood correctly the difference is that if I wanted to change something in the JSON file I would have to do it within the program in a more manual way, while with mySQL it would be much easier to modify the data.

Is that right?";;
"Yes. More or less.

But you shouldn't edit the JSON file manually. You should create tools to help do data entry.

It's the same for databases but the SQL language will already have typical functions built in (sorting, selecting etc). Neither of these things are user-friendly and will require you to place a layer between it and the user.";;
"Tools like functions?

Sorry If I sound like noob here, I really don't know how to interact with a database, that's why I thought JSON would be a simpler way to do this.";;
"OK here's an example.

Table Name: ColoredShapes

ID | Shape | Color
---|---|----
1 | Triangle | Red
2 | Triangle | Blue
3 | Triangle | Green
4 | Square | Red
5 | Hexagon | Blue
6 | Triangle | Orange


 You could ask MySQL to spit out all shapes that are blue...

    SELECT * FROM ColoredShapes WHERE Color = ""Blue""

And it will spit back....

ID | Shape | Color
---|---|----
2 | Triangle | Blue
5 | Hexagon | Blue

You could sort the Shapes column alphabetically etc.

But with JSON, which is just a file format you have to do all of this yourself.

A database is like a text editor + text file. With all of the neat little functions like Find and Replace. 

Whereas JSON is just a text file.

If I made an app using mySQL and tried to run it on other computer, would I need to install mySQL there?

I'm asking this because although JSON seems definitely more complicated to handle, I would have no problem giving my app to someone to test.";;
"> If I made an app using mySQL and tried to run it on other computer, would I need to install mySQL there?

Yes. A service has to run in the background and handle all of the work you throw at it. MySQL is intended to be used on servers as a service after all. So that's how it's built.

There are alternatives like [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) that are serverless. The data is stored in a file and you would manipulate it using a library.";;
Thank you, It seems like SQLite or JSON is the way to go then, since I don't want to rely on a server, right?;;
Yes. You don't want a service running in the background if it's unnecessary. Especially something as complex and resource hungry as a MySQL service. ;;

"Json is fine but it doesn't scale if you need to store a lot of stuff.  For instance, imagine you had a `person` object and needed to store 100 million such records.

You'd use a database, not a json file.

There are many things wrong with json files; amongst the largest ones is the fact that you cannot do a random seek since the file contains text of arbitrary length.  So for instance, given such a json file, it would require scanning through the entirety of the file to determine how many records were contained within.";;
I see, but I won't use large amounts of data and I can't rely on a server. Would you recomment JSON then?;;
Depends on your use case.  A json file is fine if you don't have a lot of data and don't need super fast performance.;;
The alternative would be something like SQLite?;;
"Sure that would work, as would a variety of other techniques, including well-known standards (e.g. XML, or just a CSV file), or you can roll your own.

As one example, you could imagine that text files compress really nicely, so maybe instead of json, you want to create the json string and then compress it into a binary file.  That can be overkill though, if your file never exceeds a few kb in size.

Note that one example of where text files do better than certain other storage formats is that they tend to be human-readable (and also human-editable).";;
I see, thanks for your help.;;
"There are non-relational databases that might work better for you than SQL. Check out mongo (mongodb.org/). Its internal representation is JSON-like, and it's stupidly easy to set up in Python.

Could be changed to:

    if(discriminant <= 0){
      System.out.println(""discriminant is less than or equal to 0, no solutions found"");

I'd also try to split up your code into different functions a bit.";;
Yeah we have to use them because he wants us to have an error message come up if someone puts in an invalid number ... It can't crash ;;
You can certainly print an error message without using exceptions. You just have to check for the invalid input before using math.sqrt, and don't call math.sqrt if the inputs aren't valid.;;
"What /u/Wizzad suggested *is* an error message.

Also, you may want to split your logic into:

"The linq .Select method extension can take a Func<T1,T2> as an argument. Since a collection of chars is IEnumerable, you can project your enumeration of letters into an enumeration of colors like this. This is also known as a 'map' operation.

I assume I would want a function to read the current array, check for a condition. IE: if element is ""A"" then then set the first position of another array to a chosen color.

(Actually that wont work like that, because it'll sort it as it goes and I want to keep it unsorted. 
So, I'll have to figure something else out for this problem) As you cannot change the value of an element in an array correct?

If you were to pass this to your character array's .Select method, it would return a new enumeration that was all blue.

"One thing that stands out right away: use curly braces for multiple statement branches.

Unless whitespace is significant in your parser, it's probably always going to run that last line.

The way it's indented in your gist is deceptive if that's the case, and it shouldn't hurt anything either way to add the curly braces to clarify your intention.

Edit: and just to make this more clear, the way your gist would probably be interpreted by your compiler's parser is something like this code:

    if (temp.retrieveAt(i+r) == null) {
        currentValue = productCoeff;
    } else {
        currentValue = (temp.retrieveAt(i+r));

    currentValue = currentValue.addComplex(productCoeff);

If you only want it to run that last line when the `else` branch is run, as it was indented in the gist, do something like this:

    if (temp.retrieveAt(i+r) == null) {
        currentValue = productCoeff;
    } else {
        currentValue = (temp.retrieveAt(i+r));
        currentValue = currentValue.addComplex(productCoeff);

"If you're creating web applications, you pretty much only need HTML, CSS and JavaScript on the client side. PHP isn't necessary and you don't need C++ necessarily. You'll probably want a JavaScript framework like Angular or Backbone, or at least using jQuery.

You'll also need a server and database to handle requests, storage and processing. For that, you have a lot of options such as Python, Ruby, Java, and JavaScript (Node). Each of these has frameworks to make the work easier as well such as Ruby on Rails and Express for Node.

For the database, you have plenty of options. If you're familiar with SQL, that is a very common solution. There are many flavors of SQL such as MySQL and PostGreSQL. There's also NoSQL database languages such as MongoDB which uses document-based records instead of tables.

You can program a full web application using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript by using Node/Express and Mongo on the back end.

Thank you so much for your helpful answer!";;
"It's not necessarily more or less straight-forward than SQL. The choice depends on the needs of your application, although if you're just trying to make a small app to learn then either choice will be perfectly fine. If you want to concentrate on JavaScript, then Mongo and Node is perfect.

Unfortunately, server-side code is pretty much mandatory for anything beyond a static website. Certainly anything app-like that needs databases and data retrieval will require server side code. There are web-based services such as Parse and Firebase that can act as back ends for your app, but I don't personally know much about them. Sooner or later, if you want to be a web application developer, you'll either need to write server-side code or hire someone to do it. I'd recommend checking out Udacity's *Full Stack Fundamentals* course to get a good overview of the concepts and practices. The course uses Python, but it will at least give you an idea of how things work and piece together. Their database class is also useful if you end up going with SQL. ";;

In a start up or getting a phd?";;
"I can second startups. The one that I've been working at for the last year has been pretty fun since the team is small (so I carved out a few areas of expertise pretty easily) and I get to work on almost every aspect of the product (brand, frontend, backend, project management, qa, etc).

Usually you'll get more responsibility at a startup because they don't have the resources to hand hold. That might be a good idea for you to explore, OP.";;
I'll definitely look into that;;
Do something about your current situation. You keep saying that there is a lot of old problems so why not refactor some of the code? You can focus on making the future code better, and newer?;;
It's harder than it seems because I don't have a lot of time to spend there, and it's basically refactoring the entire framework the original team designed, impacting every single app. But yeah, I've thought about it before !;;
"A few things come to mind:

1. Good programmers working on good projects spend time refactoring and improving the quality of code. You don't want to let things slip just because the cold wasn't clean. Consider finding work with some place that is working with cleaner code.

2. Many industry jobs will go beyond stuff like implementing new buttons. It sounds like your job just sucked. You need a better one.

Academia might provide more challenge for you, provided that the atmosphere and paycheck suits you. You can also find more creative positions in industry, although it's more difficult to identify these positions (since job postings lie through their teeth about the creativity involved in a job).";;

Find an organization with opportunity, a place that will give you some freedom of choice as you move forward with your career. Search for ""Best tech companies to work for"" and apply to them.

Although you may be able to handle the responsibility, it's a bad business decision to load up a newbie with mission critical tasks. Too much risk. Bide your time, show initiative.

Yes, this is what my colleague calls ""dull and stupid enterprise coding"". However this is not the end. Basically you need to change the job several times - so by and by you will see better what opportunities there are besides adding buttons to UI or columns to database. I've moved (in Java sense) to backend-related projects based on microservices architecture - it is more interesting sometimes, involving some funny modern platform solutions etc... You, however, can go further and thread the paths of bigdata, probably data-science etc. I do not mean this is going to be easy change, of course.";;

Looking at the actual ECMAScript/JavaScript spec will show you step-by-step how internal functions work. [Here's the latest version](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html) (published June 2015) and [here's the part about `String.prototype.split`](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/6.0/index.html#sec-string.prototype.split).;;
awesome this is very helpful thanks;;
"The other guy linked the spec. However, I would personally say it's better to refer to a ""real world"" document like those in the MDN, which will reflect how things actually are. The reason for this is because not all browsers might follow the spec or have even adopted it yet. There's also features that are non-standard (some that are available in all the major browsers, so just as usable).

Granted, none of those are source code. I'm not sure if there even is a source code. I would expect many standard library functions to be native code (ie, not JS) for efficiency.

With that said, many standard library methods can certainly be implemented in JS (and many cannot). If you search online, you can probably find general algorithms. For example, a way to implement a basic split on a single character would be along the lines of (and this is pseudocode):

    partitions = []
    workingString = ""
    for character in string
        if character != splitCharacter
            workingString += character
        else
            partitions.add(workingString)
            workingString = ""

And this could be expanded for other things, such as if we want to split on a sequence of characters or for splitting an empty string to split every character.";;

"In any case you're getting a "" at the start of your list because initially your list is something like

    aaa -> ccc -> bbb -> "" -> null

e.g. you have a dummy node at the end, and this is getting caught up in the bubble sort.

Consider on the first pass. With the last element ccc (after being swapped with bbb), ccc->next is not null, this means that ccc and "" will be swapped because "" is less than ""ccc"". 

This can be seen easily by adding something like `	printf(""\""%s\"" \""%s\""\n"", a->data, b->data);` to your swap function.

I think I solved that part thanks! Now I have to fix the memory leak!;;

"All files are binary files. However, some files contain a restricted set of possible binary values that humans can read and that many utilities treat as ""text"".

> Were they using the phrase wrong when they said this?

Yes, or you misunderstood them. Bash source files are always textual.";;
"In those contexts (that is, compiled languages) where executable files are non-text files, they are often called ""binaries"" or ""binary files"". He may have just slipped and accidentally used the same word for a human-readable executable file when he should have said ""executable"".
";;
"Some terminology:

>this file was still in of bash

More accurately, we'd say that the file is ""plain text"" (Bash is the programming language that the file contents are written in). As /u/exoticmatter mentioned, all files are stored in binary. But we often differentiate between plain text files and non-plain text files (which are often called ""binary files"", as well).

The reason for this distinction is that all plain text files can be opened in a text editor (provided that the text editor supports the used encoding) whereas binary files cannot be opened in a meaningful way unless we know the format. For example, a bitmap file has some metadata in a particular structure, then a matrix of pixel colors. If we didn't know how to read a bitmap file, we wouldn't be able to display an image (but we *could* open the file and look at the binary data, although it won't be human readable).

To elaborate on that, encoding refers to the mapping of binary data to characters in a plain text file. Eg, in UTF-8 (the most common encoding), code point 65 is the character ""A"". This is how plain text files are stored in binary: the files can be thought of as nothing more than a sequence of code points.

Also of note is that some people will use ""binary file"" to refer to an executable file (like a windows EXE file). This is probably the definition your quote refers to. This is quite a common usage in the context of file downloads (""downloading source code vs a binary"").";;

"The language is completely cross platform. It's libraries that aren't. There's some very popular libraries that are used for creating GUIs which are Windows only. This is no different from how things are with C++, except that these libraries are much more popular than using the Windows API in C++ is.

It's entirely possible to stay cross platform if you avoid these libraries. An example is how the Xamarin stack is used to create C# applications for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone. It allows most code to be shared (with a small amount that can't be shared due to platform differences -- this is not a limitation of the language).

Also of note is that Visual Studio is the de facto IDE. Nothing comes close to it in quality. As a result, most C# dev happens on Windows. Even people using Xamarin to create iOS apps (which requires a Mac due to Apple's shitty licensing) often still develop on Windows and use programs to push the code to the Mac for compilation and packaging.";;

"You're most likely going to end up learning about all 3 of those languages (and more) at one point or another, so I wouldn't really worry about which language to start off with. Just pick a domain/topic that you're particularly interested in, pick a language that looks interesting, and go from there. 

But to answer your specific question, if you were interested in game dev, some languages that might be useful are...

- C and C++ (both are low-level and so are necessary when you want absolute speed and performance)
- C# (Unity uses C#)
- Java (If you're going to learn C#, might as well learn Java -- they're not that much different)
- Lua (frequently embedded in game engines to do scripting)
- JavaScript (if you want to make HTML5 games)
- Python (there are several online tutorials that teach Python + making games, which makes Python an accessible place to start. 3d modeling software like Blender also let you script using Python).

If you wanted to do web development, some useful languages to know would be...

- Ruby and Ruby on Rails (a lot of people like using RoR and you're probably going to have to interact with a RoR project in the future whether you like it or not + lots of useful tools are written in Ruby)
- JavaScript and Node.Js (JavaScript is the only programming language that runs in your web browser; there's a lot of people excited about Node.js; there are many tools (Grunt, Gulp, etc) written in Node.js)
- Python (not as trendy as Ruby or Node.js, but has a mature set of web development libraries. Python is also used in way more domains then Ruby or JavaScript, making it a useful general programming language to know if you're interested in more then just webdev)
- Java (Larger companies will tend to use Java for stability + performance reasons over Ruby or Node.js)
- PHP (Many websites are written in PHP/you're probably going to interact with PHP code in the future whether you like it or not)
- SQL (Not really a language, but essential for interacting with databases)

If you're interested in server maintenance, some useful languages to learn would be:

- Bash (for Linux/OS X scripting)
- Powershell (for Windows scripting)
- Python (for more general scripting)

But for now, since you're just starting with JavaScript, I would stick with that for the next few months to a year. I would only look at branching out either after you've completed a few non-trivial projects in JavaScript + feel somewhat comfortable using JavaScript.

PHP allows the site to be served dynamically and speak with a database (so you don't have to manually make a million pages, you make a template that follows rules of how to serve the HTML and CSS of a page). JavaScript lets you change the page without reloading, eventually you get into angularjs and stuff like that which makes it easier to make your site RESTful (I'd say don't look at this for awhile, it's quite a bit more complicated and you should get the basics down first). MYSQL is the database on the back end of all this, it stores stuff like ""what products do we have in the store"" or ""what is this persons username and did they enter the correct password"" (by checking a hash hopefully not storing the password, that's a big no no). When you say HTML/CSS I'm not sure if you understand that those are two different things that are closely related. It's the idea that you can take any page regardless of content and style it a certain way by separating the content (the HTML) from the design (CSS).

"    __init__(self):

            self.value = value;

You create a new Person with:

    p = Person(5)

So you can set the initial values and state of the instance of that class by defining things in the init method

When you see

    class Person(Object):

You're defining a new class that extends Object. Object can be any class really.

while you're right, inheriting from `object` does have a bit of a special meaning in python 2. It turns the class into a [new-style class](https://docs.python.org/2/glossary.html#term-new-style-class), allowing it to use some more features.

"You should go read something on python classes and object oriented programming in general.

The class acts as a blueprint or template for the object(s) to be created.  When you do:

    s = Stuff(""scene 5"")

You're creating a new `Stuff` object and assigning it to the variable `s`.  The `__init__` acts as a constructor in python.  When you call the above line python will create a new object for you and call that constructor function with the string you pass in (in this case, I used ""scene 5"").  That is then available in the `scene` variable in the constructor function.  Oh, and in python, there isn't an implicit `this` referring to the current object but it is passed to every member function as the first variable.  The convention is to use `self` but it could be anything.

Hope this helps!";;

"XML is a form of data representation. It is meant to allow for the storage of many types of data in a format that is both human readable and straightforward for a machine to parse.

To look at you might think it is HTML, and you wouldn't be far from the truth. It's been around for donkeys years now and shares a common heritage with HTML, in fact XHTML is a dialect of XML. By dialect I mean it is possible to use your own 'version' of XML by choosing your own data structure and naming conventions to suit your needs, and as long as it meets the relatively simple XML specs it can be handled by any application that speaks the language. Think of it as choosing your own element and attribute names and nesting structure to represent data how you see fit. 

XML was once thought of as the holy grail of data storage but has been supplanted in recent years by JSON, which in many cases achieved the same thing but in a far more efficient format (XML can be very verbose with any sufficiently complex structure). Still, for complex data sets and for times you need interoperability with other XML formats it's still very popular. It's easy to learn and very well supported by a lot of software. ";;
"It's simply a way of structuring data. For example, your app needs to know what permissions are needed (eg, can I use the camera?). Instead of putting this data in the code (because it's plain old data and thus doesn't need to be in code), I could put it into a file. The file needs some kind of structure so that I know how to retrieve the specific data that I want. That structure is XML.

XML has other advantages, such as allowing you to make changes without recompiling the app. This is because the XML file is read at run-time and thus changes will be read when you re-run the app. This can speed up development sometimes.

Note that XML isn't the only format we can use to structure data. JSON is an example of an alternative format that's been largely replacing XML in some places (it's less verbose and closer represents lists and dictionaries).

Websites don't usually use XML. Some web APIs do, but the web is one area where JSON is *way* more popular (particularly since it's so easy to create and parse in JS). HTML is like XML, but not the same (the similarities are obvious, but it's possible to write valid HTML that is not valid XML).";;
What do you mean by plain old data as opposed to code?;;
By data, he means simply information, opposed to code, where the most part are instructions that work with said data. ;;
"That's actually a little hard to answer. Mostly defined by having no interactivity (it's not a programming language where you'd specify actions.

[Some answers here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/642357/whats-the-difference-between-data-and-code) do a better job at explaining this subtle difference (note that code is data, too, but code is usually defining behavior in addition to storing information -- here, we're just trying to store information).

I use the distinction ""plain old"" to try to refer to this lack of behavior. It might make more sense to state that XML is not a programming language and that's how it lacks the ability to define behavior (but it can store information that a programming language could use).";;
So for the Android tutorials they seem to use XML files to specify the layout of your UI. Would it be meaningful to store something like camera permissions and UI layout (different types of data) in the same XML data structure, or is that something that's not done?;;
The reason the UI layout is done in XML is so you don't have to write the code for the UI yourself.  You can just edit an XML file and create a new layout.  This is pretty common in UI designers, but isn't the only option (AFAIK, I'm not an android developer).;;
"That's not done. It could be done that way, but it's not the approach the designers of the Android SDK used. There's a good reason for this.

Android apps instead have a ""manifest file"". As the name implies, it details metadata about the app, including the target SDK version and permissions. The reason for this is because when we obtain an app, we need to quickly figure out the permissions before we execute any code. The manifest file provides an easy way to do so. APKs are zip files and the `AndroidManifest.xml` must be in the root of the archive.";;
"One major advantage of XML compared to earlier file data storage ideas, is that if you read an XML file, instead of reading the whole file, you fetch the data you actually need.

For example, if there is an XML file like this:

    <contact>
       <name>iamiamwhoami<ame>
       <forum>learnprogramming</forum>
    </contact>

Your program might expect only those 2 values, but if you get instead:

    <contact>
       <name>iamiamwhoami<ame>
       <forum>learnprogramming</forum>
       <status>friend</status>
    </contact>

You won't choke because of the additional tag... you just will ignore it.

"HTML/CSS are just markup and design languages. You can't ""calculate"" or ""figure out"" anything with them.

Let's take a small example: 

You want two input boxes. A user can fill out both and then submit them to find sum of the two numbers.

So let's break this down by language...

#HTML:

    <input type='text' id='number1'></input>
    <input type='text id='number2'></input>
    <div id='submit'>submit</div>
    <div id='answer'></div>

    <!-- these are where you will put your two input boxes for numbers for the user to input, and a div for the user to click to submit and find the answer -->

#CSS:

    input[type=text] {
        width: 100px;
        height: 40px;
        border-radius: 5px;
        /* this decorates the input sections */
    }
    
    #submit {
        padding: 8px;
        background-color: #444;
        color: white;
        border-radius: 5px;
        /* this decorates the submit button */
    }
    
    #answer {
        color: red;
    }

    /* notice that CSS is ONLY used for adding style */

#JavaScript:

    function addNumbers () {
        num1 = parseFloat(document.getElementById('number1').value); // gets the value of the first HTML input box and parses the string into a number.
        num2 = parseFloat(document.getElementById('number2').value);
    
        document.getElementByID('answer').innerHTML = ""The answer is: "" + (num1 + num2); // calculates the answer and then puts it into the div with the id 'answer'
    }
    
    document.getElementById('submit').addEventListener('click', addNumbers); on 'submit' click, run addNumbers function

So as you can see, with HTML I added the input boxes, submit button, and the div where the answer will be.

With CSS I added styling to all the elements.

With JavaScript I actually calculated the numbers and put it into the answer box.";;
So without Javascript, the website would only be static, right? Is that what Javascript does to webpages and makes them more dynamic? By the way, thanks for the great comment explaining everything part by part. ;;
"Right. JavaScript brings the ""intelligence"" into your page. With HTML and CSS your page will always look the same (unless you add media queries in CSS to change the layout with different resolutions). With JavaScript you can do anything. You can scrape the web for information and display it on your page, contact other servers, calculate things, manipulate HTML and CSS. Pretty much anything.";;
There are a few things you can do with CSS but yes, you've got it.  JS adds dynamic things to the page like on the fly color changing, re-sizing and advanced stuff like node allows you to only update parts of a page instead of re-downloading it when you load;;
depends on what you mean by static - some people extend the meaning to sites that don't load content dynamically (think early 2000's). ;;
"The way I like to imagine it is HTML being the skeleton, JavaScript is the muscle, and CSS is the skin. 

Edit: and if you're one for Mnemonic devices just remember it like three S's. Structure, Strength, and Style.";;
Hahaha, nice analogy!;;
So what about PHP? I can do what you just did with JavaScript, but with PHP instead. Should I stop with PHP and start learning JavaScript? Does JavaScript have some capabilities that PHP doesn't or vice versa? ;;
"There are two parts to a web application, the server and the client.

The server is another computer somewhere else, that you talk to over the internet. PHP runs on the server, and it generates HTML (and potentially other formats, CSS, JS, etc). These are downloaded to the client computer.

In this example, by using PHP and a form submission instead of javascript, the browser sends a network request, the server renders a new page, and the browser has to download the whole webpage again.

With javascript, it happens on the client-side, in the browser itself. This means nothing needs to be downloaded, no additional page load. Anything dynamic that doesn't need it's own URL or page load can be done in javascript for a smoother experience.

Both server logic (backend language, PHP for example) and client logic (javascript) have their place, and both are valuable in their own way.

----
**Edit**

Real-world examples -- 
The collapse button on reddit comment threads. That's done with javascript. To do that with PHP would mean the entire page would need to reload just to re-render the page to toggle it.

There is also the case of a 'mixed' approach, known as AJAX. The reddit upvote/downvote buttons are a prime example: on click, javascript changes the style/color of the button, and javascript sends a background network request to the server (which is written in python, btw), to tell the server you voted, without reloading the page.";;
Thank you for your answer. JavaScript is now on my list.;;
But if say I have a form that just takes user inputed data. Their name and gender for example and I just want to put it in a text file should I write it in PHP or JavaScript?;;
Writing files should be done on the server, so PHP.;;
Have been asking the same question myself.. (I have done html/css since January so I am a beginner still). ;;
"PHP calculations are done on the server side vs client side for JavaScript.

This means for instance that if you wanted to do the calculator with PHP, it requires a page reload every single time you want to calculate the numbers. JavaScript however calculates right ON the page, so you can do everything in JavaScript without ever leaving/reloading the page.";;
"PHP is going to run on the server, whereas JavaScript is largely client-side, with some specific frameworks being server-side like  Node.

Where you use each one is a little harder to define, but if you are going to fetch things from a database (mySQL) you are going to use PHP.  If you want to do something on a web page without reloading, JavaScript is the language.  Inputs from the user you can do it with either, but php is going to need some method to get the submitted data.

I'm sure someone can explain this better...";;
"With php, being on the server there are some things that you don't immediately have access to. For instance, if you want to animate elements on the page when a user clicks or drags an html element, you'll need access to the DOM and browser event; Because the DOM is actually rendered in the browser and events are generated in the browser, it makes the most sense to use javascript (which has immediate access to both) to animate the elements.  Many other event driven actions can probably be handled in the browser as well unless you need to get or store data on the server.

Aside from animating elements on user interactions. You may want access to browser information that is not necessarily available in php. Changing browser history or updating the hash (#) location are things that you would want to do in Javascript. 

I will say that I lean heavily towards recommending learning Javascript over php. You don't have to stop at one or the other, but javascript can be used on both the server side and the client side, where php is strictly server side. Javascript is becoming even more ubiquitous as the IoT(Internet of things) becomes more prevalent. 

Php is not likely to leave the web any time soon, but as nodejs gains popularity you can expect that more companies will be looking for the rockstar utilitarian javascript developer who can do both server-side and client-side programming over the developer who is mediocre in both php and javascript.";;
"All php code is run on the sever, before the user ever sees the page. Its useful to load up content (like in reddit, for example) where the contents of a page are pulled from a database.

JavaScript is for making changes to a page AFTER its loaded. ";;
Hey, one more thing... Does javascript work more efficiently when using jquery exclusively. Or could Javascript do a better job at the front end than jquery?;;
"Define efficient really. Time efficiency means you should choose jQuery because it is way faster to write. However since jQuery only builds on JavaScript's fundamentals, it can't possibly be faster.

That said, if the quality of code you write is worse than jQuery's code, maybe jQuery would have an advantage. ";;
"jQuery *is* javascript. It's just a library.

Raw, plain javascript is much faster (execution-wise), but takes a little longer to write. Also, different browsers have differences in the javascript APIs they expose, and jQuery abstracts away these differences so you don't need to worry about them.";;
You'll get your big taste of it when Odin has you make the etch-a-sketch.  It will be very clear then, so keep on going :);;

Get the full error code, because my guess is that another table or tables FKs to your counterid and another session is trying to update that table.  The lock sp will acquire a lock in the table you specify and any other table that a modification of the specified table could affect.

"Firstly, as you probably already know, tests won't stop bugs from happening (but can help ensure your code is correct and avoid what would otherwise become a bug) and if the tests are automated, they can prevent bugs from being reintroduced (""regression"").

Debugging will mostly come with practice. With that said, it sounds like you need to expand on the tools front. Get a debugger. Your IDE probably has one. Learn how to use it (google). Learn how to create break points, watch points (aka conditional break points), how to step through your code, etc.

As you experience and correct more bugs (which will take time -- no avoiding that), you'll naturally begin picking up patterns. Stuff like what an error message probably means (since error messages are often inaccurate since they may be caused by a different issue that interacts with the part that failed).

Also, familiarity with a system is incredibly useful. There'll be times when you can hear a description of the bug and have a good idea of what is wrong before you've even looked at the code. This, too, will come only with experience (in the system in question).

One other word of advice: don't give up early. If you're turning to forums because you haven't figured out what's wrong in ten minutes, that's too early. Some bugs can take a really long time to identify and correct. As a beginner, it's often worthwhile to put quite a bit of time into trying to solve the bug yourself. Being given the answer on a silver platter won't have the same learning impact.";;
You try and you practice.;;
"You mentioned that you are testing your code which is a great start! But if you still run into problems, here's why:

 1. Your tests are insufficient or
 2. You don't know what to test

Unfortunately, these are things you'll encounter for your whole programming career. However, you can learn to write better tests. Even if you don't want to do pure test-driven development, I would recommend at least reading about the best practices of TDD. My favorite book on this is [*Test Driven* by Lasse Koskela](http://www.manning.com/koskela/).

You might also consider using an IDE. Print statements can get you far, but sometimes it's much easier to just look at all of the variables at a given point in the code.";;
"learn to read error messages, learn to search them in SO and google so you know what it means and possible solutions. 

That's about it :)";;
"I find the trick is to break everything down into small chunks that you can thoroughly debug it.  

If your functions get too long or do more than one thing it becomes hard to isolate the error.

Stepping through the buggy code in an IDE, so you can see what is causing the unexpected side-effects or daft over-sights is extremely useful.";;
Stepping through the code helps a lot.;;
"These are excellent starts.  Here's a few more tips to consider:

* before you run the code - anticipate EXACTLY what you think it will do.  Compare your expectations to the actual results.
* try to trace the code without a computer.  Use a piece of paper and write down each variable at the top of the paper.  ""Run"" the program in your head and each time a variable changes, write the new value.  See if you can see why the code is doing what you think.
* learn to use a real debugger.  If your IDE has one, by all means use it.  If you're in JavaScript, keep the developer console open all the time and learn how to use the debugger.  Even an old-school command-line debugger like GDB can be invaluable.  Use this tool to step through your code one line at a time, watching the values of all the key variables.
* Factor your code.  If code isn't working, break each idea into its own line.  A line of code that does a dozen different things may look cool, but when it breaks you don't know which of the clever things on that line broke.  
* Comment out suspicious code.  (this goes hand  - in - hand with factoring)  If your code is not running, comment out suspicious code until you get it running again, and then move the comments until you find the spot that's giving you trouble.
* Google your exact error message.  Error messages are often cryptic.  Copy and paste that sonofagun and see who else has run into that error and see if there are any commonalities to your code.
* Some code isn't worth saving. This is psychologically very difficult, but sometimes there's a logic or syntax error you just can't see. It might be faster to start over than to repair the code. It's amazing how often this works.
* Have another programmer look it over. If you made an error the first time, you may not know it's an error.  Some really tricky things are obvious to a programmer who hasn't been staring for two hours.  I've been programming for 30 years, and the other day a relatively young programmer found a stupid error that had been bugging me for hours (I was accidentally sending the wrong parameter to a function.)  If you don't know anyone in person, go online.
* Explain your problem to your dog or cat.  Insane, but it really works.  Just the process of explaining exactly what you want to do and what's not working will help.  Pro-tip.  Dogs are less judgmental than cats when it comes to code review, but neither are very good at debugging.
* Get experience.  Sounds like trite advice, but it's the best.  The more often you code, the more often you'll find patterns you recognize.  The more mistakes you make now, the less mistakes you'll make later.  Gotta pay your dues.

Though of course you should avoid abusing people for example by repeating your mistakes. E.g. if you are told once that your coding style is very poor, it is bad idea to tell ""but I do it for myself"" and then ask opinions about another code which is also poorly styled and you have no intention to improve it.";;

these challenges are really awesome. i've worked through the first five. really great way to ease into algorithms while exploring different libraries ways needed to accomplish tasks. for instance by challenge four i was already writing a bot that saves web text to a pdf file having selenium navigate urls.

Wow!  Programming challenges on the Ubuntu forums? Very nice!  I will have check these out.  Especially since I am trying to learn more and more about Linux. ;;
Try Codechef.;;
Here, maybe. Also, I've found that--when the problems aren't too insane--I get pretty good commentary from /r/dailyprogrammer.;;
I've heard good things about exercism.io, and I've had a lot of fun with CodeWars.;;
You need to decide which platform you want to target (Android phones?  Firefox plugins? etc).  And then google tutorials for building simple applications for those platforms.  There are thousands of such tutorials that Google will find for you.;;
"Writing a web interface involves the most pieces but is the most accessible.  But you'd likely need to write your calculator in javascript or make server calls for simple things.

What language are you starting from?";;
I only know python and C.;;
"If you know C you know C, but for low-level programming it's the specific platform you need to understand rather. So read about the Linux kernel. A search for ""Linux kernel"" on Amazon finds several books that look good, some newer than others, several published by O'Reilly which have a good reputation generally.
";;
I'll have to check that out, thank you!!;;
What problems do you have exactly that looking at kernel code would help?  That doesn't sound like it would be that useful for sysadmin stuff.;;
"Fair question. Well, for example I believe I MAY HAVE stumbled across a bug with an older kernel (2.6.18-404) involving the bonding kernel module, and the bnx2 module. Basically, if you use them in a certain combination, the modules simply will not load and kernel won't even see them as present (even though they are). 

As it stands, the issue has been in Red Hat's hands for several weeks now. They're doing their best to help (and this is in no way a dig against them), but without being able to actually look at and understand what is going on under the skirt, I am more or less beholden to them figuring it out. I think i know what's going on, but I can't confirm it because I don't know anything about what the kernel is trying to do when it fails, and where the failure actually occurs. I'm just kinda handing it off to the vendor and saying ""Is broken, pls fix."" In the meantime, I have servers in our QA lab that aren't able to function properly because they aren't running the same OS stack as our other machines, so any QA testing on them is currently invalid.

Basically, I want to be able to understand what is going on underneath so I can ask better questions, and therefore get better answers. I hope that makes sense.";;
Mmmm!;;
"/personalDetails for multiple and /personalDetails/{id} for single. This is only one of many ways though - nomenclature is ultimately up to you.

You could also use one endpoint and have a conditional statement that checks if the request data is an object or an array, and then perform the necessary actions based upon that.

Question 2 is a little unclear to me. Can you elaborate on what you are trying to do?";;
"In this case, both will need an id parameter. Imagine the request payload looks like

    {
        ""id"": ""..."",
        ""name"":""...""
    }

I would like to use the same request payload for both single input and multiple inputs:

in your suggestion, with /personalDetails/{id} means I will have redundant id parameter, 1 from the URL and 1 from the request body?";;
"It sounds like it would be simpler to always pass in an array then. If you want to update a single person, the array would just have 1 element. That way you would only have one endpoint (/personalDetails) that would handle single or multiple updates. 

Does that solve the issue?
";;
yeah, always passing an array is a solution. Was just thinking if the endpoint can be magically smarter, I guess not :);;
"You might be overthinking this. Just use one endpoint that accepts 0 to many items. 1 is part of this set, so you're good to go.

Less is more. Now you'll only need to document, maintain and debug 1 endpoint. Your clients will only have to implement 1 interface.

http://threevirtues.com/

";;
"Ideally ... but do you have suggestion on how to write a single endpoint that accept 0 to many items. In this case I am using Spring in the back end.

the @RequestBody in the @Controller parameter will need to be either an array or an object, if I want to accept multiples I'll need to have it as an array, which will reject single object input.

I tried:

    public ResponseObject doSomething(@RequestBody RequestObject... requests)

but that endpoint will fail if I pass in a non-array input.";;
If you want to send 1 thing, send it an array of length 1?;;
Yeah, I might have to go down that path. I just thought if there's a better way to handle it without forcing the request payload to always be an array.;;

"Subreddits are just another table in a database.  When you go to reddit.com/r/whatever the router notices the pattern and knows to send your request to code that is going to search the database for a subreddit called ""whatever"" and then get the threads that belong to it

Reddit is also open source - https://github.com/reddit/reddit and has a redditdev subreddit - /r/redditdev";;
It is likely from web server rewrite rules that know how to turn `x.reddit.com` into `www.reddit.com/r/x`.  ;;
i was thinking it was way harder than that. I love that feature, I was wondering why all sites with sub-sites don't use that model.;;
"It is pretty much what /u/rjcar said along with a wildcard dns record (to map `[anything].reddit.com` to the server). As to why more sites don't do it, there are a few reasons. One would be if you want your site to support SSL. Typically you need either a different SSL certificate for each sub-domain or a wildcard certificate. The wildcard certificate at [Symantec](https://www.symantec.com/page.jsp?id=compare-ssl-certificates) costs from $2k a year to $5k for three years. Another issue (which is easy to solve, but still something that needs to be done) has to do with cookies (i.e. session or ""remember me"" login). They are domain specific and each subdomain is a different domain. Since reddit only does a redirect, this is likely less of an issue.";;

Most programming languages are general purpose. Languages which are *not* general purpose are called [domain specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language). See also the notion of [Turing-Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).;;

"Efficiency is important when it is necessary to be efficient. Sometimes efficiency is so important that a very complex design is required to get that efficiency, but most of the time that's not the case.

Efficiency, readability, simplicity, are all aspects that must be prioritized based on the particular situation.";;
"I think its more a question of know *where* and *how* to optimize.  A lot of programmers, especially novice programmers, tend to fall into a trap of looking for *microoptimizations*.  This might mean a code change whose performance impact is truly negligible - perhaps optimizing a single loop, or optimizing some subroutine that spends most of its time waiting on something slow anyway (like user interaction, network communication, etc.)  Many times, these are optimizations that the compiler can make for you behind the scenes.  Often these microoptimizations do make for more complex, buggier, difficult to maintain code - which is why experienced developers discourage ""optimizing"" code at the expense of readability and simplicity, *unless* you can quantify the real performance benefit of the more complex code.

Given the speed of modern processors, I'd argue that most performance problems occur at a higher level than single loops/functions/classes - simply because the CPU is unlikely to be the bottleneck these days, in most applications.  Instead, most opportunities to optimize would be in the form of things like:

* Limiting or optimizing IO bottlenecks, like disk access, networking, etc
* Optimizing memory usage to avoid needing to swap
* High-level design/architecture issues

I think what I'm really saying is there is a skill in and of itself in knowing where to look for performance problems, and how to fix them in a way that you get the most bang for your buck - and often, performance problems really aren't in the locations that a novice developer would first look.

There certainly are exceptions to the rule in certain specific areas, but I think this applies pretty well to general application development.";;
"> As long as the code appears to work instantaneously, why bother? 

If your code interacts with a human, this is certainly true. Unfortunately, a lot of code (most?) actually interacts with other machines, not with humans. For example, if you are writing trading applications for an investment bank, I guarantee you will worry about your transactions going through far faster than what a human would perceive as ""instantaneously"".

Also, ""easily readable"" and ""efficient"" are not mutually exclusive.
";;
Good point, I guess I've never had to code in that kind of environment yet.  I see why trading apps need maximum efficiency, great example!;;
"Well for example if you are talking about animations on a webpage, jQuery will do things 100x slower than JavaScript.

However, that may mean the difference between 1,000,000 calculations per second and 10,000.

Seeing as animations only need x smooth frames per second, it's not a big deal that jQuery is way less efficient. In that case it is more efficient to write with jQuery because it's way less code and way cleaner.

On the flip side for example I was calculating daily statistics for tens of thousands of days of stock market activity. Using loops I was running in n^2 time which was noticeably slow for companies with over 20 years of data (x > 1s). However when I switched my code around I started running in n  *log* n time which saved a very noticeable bit of time.

In that case efficiency was more important. You will run into operations that are inherently intensive. The key is to make the most time consuming things efficient and don't sweat the small stuff &mdash; just make it readable.";;
"Great answer.  I guess I haven't been programming with huge data sets yet.  

Also what you are saying with the jQuery animations is very useful!  I ran into this problem a year ago while developing a web page and I never could figure out what was making my damn animations so slow and laggy hahahaha.   I even opened up a Stack Overflow question at the time and nobody told me about jQuery being slow with animations.";;
"Well it's also easy to use jQuery incorrectly.

For example here's an issue lots of people have:

$(window).scroll(function () {
    $("".xyz"").animate({'property' : 'setting'}, 500);
}

Basically they mean to say ""when the user scrolls, animate this"". Well the issue is that when you scroll, the action basically fires every pixel you scroll down. That means that the line inside is going to fire at minimum dozens of times.

So basically you are trying to perform the same animation 50 times all at the same time. Talk about slow.

So then you can use 

    $("".xyz"").stop().animate({'property' : 'setting'}, 500);
    
to tell all previous animations on the div to stop. That sort of takes care of the issue. However you are still running this action like 50x times.

So then you use a callback...

    if (animationBool === false) {
        animationBool = true;
        $("".xyz"").stop().animate({'property' : 'setting'}, 500, function () {
            animationBool = false;
        });
    }

So now, the animation won't run until the animation is already finished because it is waiting in the callback for the `animationBool` to be false again before it animates again.

So jQuery can be great if it is used in the most optimal way, but it's wayyy too easy to abuse it.

Hope that helps.";;
"Wow, this is totally useful info for me.   

Thank you so much!!";;
Glad I could pass on some useful information. :);;
"I agree and I think design and readability are more important than efficiency.  Keep in mind we really don't know (most of the time) how our software will be optimized so it doesn't make sense to waste the time optimizing it.

That being said, you shouldn't be using an O( n^2 ) algorithm when you could be using an O( log n ) algorithm, even if they both *appear to work instantaneously*.

This is because there might be some edge case where you have a lot more processing than you expect.  Or, as software is iterative, and you start adding more things to do, your inefficient code, that was harmless before, starts becoming the bottleneck that's killing your application.

But generally, I agree with you, unless you're doing something that *requires* efficiency and performance, computers are so fast this days with so much memory that it isn't the biggest concern.";;
"I guess the intended code is

    loop do
        break if even == 0
        even -= 5
        next if even % 2 == 0
        puts even
    end

You've got a = where there should be an ==.

The *break* needs to come first other wise it is skipped by *next* and you'll loop forever.";;
Can you elaborate on this? The skipping over break? I thought next if skipped over the values you instruct it to. Not other conditionals in the loop / code. What's the relation?;;
"If you had

    even = 200
    
    loop do
        even -= 5
        next if even % 2 == 0
        puts even
        break if even == 0
    end

Then when *even* = 0 the *next* branch is executed and it skips so the *break* line is never executed and you loop forever.";;
"
(number % 2) is 0 if the number is even.

So, if you have

    next if even % 2 == 0

then if the number is even   (  number % 2 == 0 ) then it will go back to line 4 of your snippet.

If the number is odd  (number % 2  is 5,  ie != 0)  then it will not go back to line 4 and it will go to line 6 and write the number)


And if you have

    next if even % 2 != 0

then if the number is even   (  number % 2 == 0 )  then it will not go back to line 4 and it will go to line 6 and write the number)

If the number is odd  (number % 2  is 5,  ie != 0)   then it will go back to line 4 of your snippet.


";;
"Skipped by next? This seems to be the piece I'm missing concept wise. I had no idea next if was going backwards in the loop. I thought it worked like so... 195, 190 (next if will skip), 185, 180 (skip again) and so on to the end of the method... so basically in my original version of the code when next if meets with a number % 2 == 0. It starts the loop / code over instead of skipping over the value? Why? If it works for ""!="". Meaning don't skip then why isn't ""="" working. Meaning skip. I'm missing a concept. Gears are turning tying to get it to click.";;
"The loop executes its body (lines 4,5,6,7) in order repeatedly until something causes the loop to end.

The 'break' statement is what causes the loop to end.  If the 'break' executes then the program will continue at line 9 - the line after the 'end'

The 'next' statement makes the loop restart - ie. jump back to line 4.  In your case your 'next' is on line 5.   So, if executed,  it will skip lines 6 and 7.";;

"- React describes itself as the V in MVC, not exactly a full fledged SPA framework like Angular, Ember, Backbone. 

- Angular: By far the most popular of the big SPA frameworks. Backed by Google. Angular 2.0 will be a major change from 1.x but in my opinion it's changing for the better. It wasn't originally made to be what it is used for today so this change as necessary to get rid of some of the major flaws from 1.x. This is the one I use. 

- Ember: A Rails like framework, probably second in popularity to Angular. I use it at work and honestly am not a huge fan. It feels a lot bulkier than Angular and I'm not a big ""convention over configuration"" guy. But to each their own. 

- Mustache is a template system, not a framework. 

- Meteor: From what I understand more of a full stack solution than anything. A Meteor/Angular combination is fairly popular from what I've seen. 

Sorry for being broad, Angular is the only one Im really knowledgeable with. No one had commented in an hour so I figured I'd give you something :D. ";;

It's worth noting that React can now be used to create native iOS/Android apps in JavaScript (using React Native). This differentiator put React onto my short list of framework to explore (along with Angular, Ember, and Meteor).;;
I believe Angular does the same thing with Ionic;;
"Yes and no.  Yes because you end up with an app that runs on a phone.  The no is a bit longer.

With Ionic, your applications runs in a WebView container, which you can think of as a stripped-down web browser.  All of your UI interaction is implemented inside of this container, so you don't get the same feel to the app since you're not using native UI components.

React Native integrates more closely with the native layer.  You structure your views with react, but the result is native platform views (rather than DOM in a browser) that interact asynchronously JavaScript application layer.  Right now it only supports iOS, but the same principles will apply to any other platforms that are added later.

The philosophy with React Native is that you learn the concepts once, and then you can apply those concepts to other platforms easily.  They insulate you from platform specifics while still letting you write apps that are tailored for each platform's strengths and UI patterns.  This is actually very similar to React in the browser where they insulate you from having to worry about maintaining relations between state and DOM.";;
"Fair. My understanding of it is limited but it's really the only cross-platform sdk I have experience with.

I do believe that you can implement it with native code as well. I've yet to do so but that's what I'm told. It's a neat little tool regardless.";;
"> React can now be used to create native iOS/Android apps in JavaScript (using React Native). 

That's nice! Do you have any idea how closely they feel like native built Obj-C/Swift apps? I've seen some PhoneGap applications and I guess React Native is a big step from that world?";;

"React + the FLUX pattern + React Router is basically a full SPA.  React's JSX files are great, too.

So don't discount React if you need / want a full SPA.

We love it here, some of us coming from Ember, others from Angular.  React makes the ""view"" portion so mind-numbingly easy, and a VERY clear separation of concerns makes customizing the other layers a breeze.  React view simply provide state (local to the component) and props (passed down from other components).

FLUX takes this further and tells you that the UI can perform actions, which update a store.  And the React view only reads data from the store.  It's one-way communication with immutable states.

It offers you a ""pure"" kind of functional programming feel without being a hassle at all.

React --> Action --> Store <-- React...  Let your stores be the single source of truth :)

I remember being excited about Angular components because the way things were organized made building larger apps easier, but get far enough and Angular becomes a complex, stateful, actually quite messy ecosystem that needs a lot of work to be configured.  I don't know about Angular 2.0, however.

In our case, we have ran into problems with React, but have yet to run into a show-stopper.  Our feature delivery has been smooth and consistent since switching over.";;
And look at alt.js if you want a library for the flux part. It takes care of a lot of the boiler plate. ;;
I agree. Angular is by far the easiest framework I've used to get going with, but big applications feel like enterprise java in all of the worst ways. React/flux is much harder to learn, but makes big apps simpler and apps that would be slow in angular because of all the two way bindings are fast in react. ;;
2 way binding (dirty checking and the like) will apparently be very comparable if not faster than React in Angular 2.x. I'm basing this completely off of podcasts and a tech-talk demonstration, though, so who knows. React really interests me but I'm trying to stay focused on one thing (Angular at the moment) and become an expert at that before branching out.;;
Interesting. I knew they were making doom updates faster, but I didn't think that it would even be possible to make the two way data binding as fast single direction data flow. I guess we'll have to wait and see. ;;
"Being the guy who just posted about React here, let me tell you that React and FLUX are really dead-simple.  I'm no where near an expert, but I'm already using React in practice and we even replaced our Angular in one app completely with React.

Becoming an ""expert"" in Angular, IMO, would not help with React.

That being said, many people are using Angular and knowing it would boost your employment prospects...";;
I just want to say that i fucking love angular. ;;
Is there a set date for Angular 2 yet? I've been apprehensive about picking it up with a total rewrite coming.;;
Pretty sure it's reached the point where the syntax won't be changing too much and you can confidently start learning 2.0 without being afraid of more major changes. As for learning 1.x, I still think it's worth it for the time being. No other reason other than I think I've become a smarter overall web developer while learning it.;;
^ ya its dope;;
To add to this, React usually goes with some version/implementation of Flux, which is a system for organizing data. It's not a full fledged solution on its own but when bundled together with other libraries it will do the job very effectively.;;

On the front end you could use angular or react js.on the back end, you could use express. You could serve the blog content from either flat files or a database. ";;
Why? How on earth would the overhead of downloading Angular/React improve the user experience of reading a blog? It's pretty much *the* canonical example of something that doesn't need much—if any—JavaScript, let alone big bloated frameworks.;;
He wants to be able to update the blog and add content without having to change source code. That's going to require some kind of templating engine and some way to spite and retrieve data at the very least. ;;
"Yep, but why does that need a front-end JavaScript framework?

Database (or flat file), back-end administration and templating. But you can do all that without ever writing a line of JavaScript.";;
It doesn't need front end templating. It needs templating somewhere and the front end I'd as good of a place as any. Using angular, it's not any more difficult than back end templating. ;;
Sure, but why do it on the front end? Why have a JavaScript dependency just to read some blog posts?;;
It's not any more difficult and there's nothing that makes a reasonable JavaScript dependency worse than a back end dependency. Front end or back end templating are both fine choices. ;;
What happens if JavaScript is disabled? Or the JavaScript doesn't load? Or the person's computer is old and slow? Why download all the logic for rendering templates to a user's computer when you've got a perfectly good server sitting there to do it?;;
This isn't 2005. Very few people are worried about computers or devices that can't or won't load JavaScript. They are worried about things like paging or commenting without reloading the entire page, both of  which will likely require JavaScript anyway.;;

"> What frameworks and such would be required for me to be able to build a nice-looking personal website that features a blog that I can update regularly without having to dig into messing with the source every time I want to update things?

You shouldn't need any JavaScript frameworks for a blog. A blog is simply text rendered on a page. If you reach the point where you need React or Angular or any of those things, you are doin' it wrong. The only front-end technologies you really need for a blog are HTML and CSS, and possibly trivial amounts of JavaScript.

Pick whatever backend language or framework you like. Python and Django are pretty nice. Not saying you shouldn't use back-end JS. Just that it's not necessary. Use it if you can find a good reason to use it, not just because it's JS.";;
">You shouldn't need any JavaScript frameworks for a blog

OK, and I'm probably going to sound *so* naive here, but how can I update the blog without having to open the site's source files, type some stuff up, and re-sync the whole thing via FTP? 

I'm sure there's a way this can be done, I just have no idea how to do it. I don't really want something as complex as WordPress, but I also want to have something relatively streamlined when I want to just blog about stuff. ";;
"There are basically two approaches:

1. A static site generator. This is basically a bunch of scripts that automate the process of updating your site. The most popular of these is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is written in Ruby. You run some command line code and it turns blobs of HTML, CSS, Markdown and so on into HTML and then uploads them.
2. A database-backed, dynamic web application. WordPress is okay. If you want to build your own, a framework like Django or Rails lets you do that easily. You'd then have an admin site (Django gives you one for free!) that lets you update the site by posting new entries etc.

The static site generator runs *on your computer* while the dynamic web app runs on the server.

With either of these options though, JavaScript frameworks (which are designed to let you built complex front-ends) aren't required at all. They solve a different problem entirely.

(On the WordPress front - I find it altogether too complex and bloated. It was once a nice lean blogging system that's become too complex because of so many strange plugins and CMS type use cases people have attached to it. My solution is to use Django instead: it gives me enough control to write what I want, but without forcing me to try and fit everything into the WordPress box. Oh, and it's Python and not PHP.)";;
"Thanks for the thorough reply! 

I have pretty much zero experience in back-end stuff, so it looks like Jekyll is going to be the way to go for what I want to do. I want to learn Rails, but that seems pretty far down the road for me at the moment :)";;
What's your favorite guide for learning Django?;;
"I just used the tutorial on the website and built some stuff.

But *Two Scoops of Django* is worth reading once you've gotten used to Django.";;
"Some good answers so far, I'll just expand on some of them.

AngularJS - someone mentioned this being the most popular, and with good reason. Its power is in its ability to do two-way data binding. You have a gmail account? Ever see your inbox UI pull up new email without having to refresh its page? That's what two-way binding is; it updates the UI with new data (in a ViewModel, part of the MVVM design pattern). Angular 2.0 will incorporate aspects of React -- namely the idea of using a ""[Virtual/Shadow DOM](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21109361/why-is-reacts-concept-of-virtual-dom-said-to-be-more-performant-than-dirty-mode)""

React - Facebook's brainchild. It's a framework for rendering only the view. Ideally, you want to use this in addition to another backend framework like: Backbone, Knockout, or jQuery(it has the capabilities) or whatever. It is causing a paradigm shift in how pages render by keeping a snapshot of in something called the Virtual DOM. The long and short of it is: React will only render parts of the page where the data has changed. Very performant. 

Knockout/Backbone - I'm grouping these two together because I'm not an expert, but I have used them enough to know their application. They are great back-end frameworks for data binding, each with their own philosophy. I would say the primary difference is that knockout has two-way binding capabilities like Angular.

You wana get into some Javascript frameworks? Now is the time. It's experiencing a crazy boom right now especially with the advent of [NodeJS](https:/odejs.org/). This is a whole other world with its own continent of frameworks. 

Let me know if you want me to clarify anything, but those seem to be the bigger frameworks. 

";;
">It is causing a paradigm shift in how pages render by keeping a snapshot of in something called the Virtual DOM. The long and short of it is: React will only render parts of the page where the data has changed. Very performant.

I think you're over-simplifying on the wrong talking point.  React is definitely introducing developers new ways to reason about their application, but it's not because they use Virtual DOM, rather it's how they use it in conjunction with the one-way data flow that makes React programs easier to think about, design and maintain.  Using Virtual DOM is actually kind of a necessity with the way React programs are written.";;
You're right, I was oversimplifying. Was just trying to capture the zeitgeist of where a lot of JS frameworks are headed. Thanks for the correction!;;
Can you really describe knockout as a backend framework though? ;;
Why not just learn and use javascript and add frameworks as you think plain javascript is lacking in something?;;
Well, I'm already familiar with plain old JavaScript. And I'm not trying to solve a particular problem here, I'm not usually a front-end guy, I'm just trying to learn a bit about what's out there and how it operates to flesh my knowledge out a bit. ;;
"If you don't identify with front end development, you might not know as much JavaScript as you think.  I'm sure you can get around but there is a lot to learn and a bunch of interesting patterns and browser APIs to dig into.

People often underestimate vanilla JS.";;
Browser API's are like frameworks in that they're not vanilla JS;;
Yes, you are right. But OP seemed interested in browser technology, hence the mention.  It was sloppy wording.;;
"You're almost certainly right. I've read a few books on it but haven't done anything really involved or heavy in JS so I'm sure I'm missing out on a lot.

JavaScript doesn't actually do integers. All Numbers are represented as double precision floating point numbers, as per the [EMCA specification](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-8.5). ;;
"What you are observing is lack of precision -- in JavaScript, every single number is represented as a floating point number. That means that when you have a very tiny number with lots of decimal places, or a very large number with many digits, you start losing precision + will not be able to accurately represent the number.

For example, try doing the following:

    var a = 10204506520767624
    console.log(a + 1);  // 10204506520767624
    console.log(a + 2);  // 10204506520767626
    console.log(a + 3);  // 10204506520767628
    console.log(a + 4);  // 10204506520767628

The solution to this is to use a bignum library -- try [bignumber.js](https://github.com/MikeMcl/bignumber.js). 

You can find some additional tips for dealing with floating point imprecision both in general and with JavaScript here: http://floating-point-gui.de/languages/javascript/";;
Thanks for the response but sadly bignumber.js is useless as this number is more than 15 digits long. ;;
"?

Did you try using it? The following seems to work perfectly for me:

    var a = new BigNumber('10204506520767624');
    console.log(a.toString());  // 10204506520767624
    console.log(a.plus(1).toString());  // 10204506520767625
    console.log(a.plus(2).toString());  // 10204506520767626
    console.log(a.plus(3).toString());  // 10204506520767627
    console.log(a.plus(4).toString());  // 10204506520767628";;
"Yeah, all I get is

Wait, I'm an idiot. I wasn't passing it as a string when I was testing it just then. Anyway, all I needed it for in the end was an == comparison with another string so it turns out it actually doesn't matter.... ;;
"IEEE double precision floating point numbers can only represent the integer range [-2^(53), 2^(53)] without loss of precision.  Your number is greater than 2^(53) so it can't be represented exactly.  For numbers between 2^53 and 2^54, only even integers can be represented, which is why ...25 rounds to ...24.  And for numbers between 2^54 and 2^(55), only every fourth integer can be represented, and after that only every eighth integer, and so on.

Edit: side note, you should never use `parseInt()` without specifying the radix.  It leads to things like numbers with a leading zero being interpreted as octal.
";;
"I've been using Vim for about 10 months now. The big difference between Vim and other editors is that Vim has modes (aka it's modal).

In other editors, you're always in what Vim calls *Insert mode*. You type keys to insert/delete text one character at a time and that's it. If you want to do more, you gotta use a hotkey with ctrl/alt, or reach for the mouse to do highlighting, or search through menus for a useful feature.

In Vim, you're usually in *Normal mode*, where [every key on the keyboard has a function](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif). This makes the mouse way less useful, because anything you need is just the reach of a finger away, and it means you can do *so* much more, and *so* quickly.

There's also text objects, buffers/windows/tabs (different than the typical one file = one tab thing every other editor uses), infinite undo history, multiple registers for copying text, multiple registers for recording macros, the ability to count certain actions, the ability to repeat actions easily, and the list goes on. Not to mention the hundreds of community-made plugins which add on top of or improve the aforementioned features. It would take me forever to explain all these features, because you would need a lot of context, and it's just better to learn for yourself over time.

If you are legitimately interested in using Vim, there's [this Github gist someone set up](https://gist.github.com/bpierre/0a0025d348b6001394e0) (coincidentally recently) which is full of resources on what to watch, read, and do exactly to learn Vim. I hadn't heard of Vim (or even vi) October of last year, but now I'm an enthusiast. You never know unless you try! (also ps Derek Wyatt's tutorial videos are the bomb)

edit: Oh yeah, and it's really old and ubiquitous, so you can run it on a toaster and it comes with almost every version of Unix. Vim is incredibly tiny, and yet can handle multi-megabyte-sized files without flinching, unlike some modern text editors ^^^*cough* ^^^Atom ^^^*cough*.";;
Awesome, thanks for the cheatsheet and the gist, definitely saving them for later!;;
"The biggest is that it's available damn near everywhere and via a terminal, which means that if you need to access a headless server or a raspberry pi or something you can probably use vim.

Beyond that you're looking at starting up the old emacs vs vim war.

EDIT: It's worth noting that it's been around and open source for a long time (decades) and is made for programmers by programmers. At this point it has a metric shit tonne of features, plugins and the like built over the years.";;
"Insert the same thing on the start of many lines? Easy.

Doing a find an replace over a range using regular expressions? Awesome.

Movement *on the keyboard without moving your fingers*.

Change one thing on the next 20 lines? Not that hard.

Most text editors push you to edit the line you are on - I think of it as editing and movement in one direction - then you use your mouse or arrow keys to move around... meh. As you get better with vim, you can move and edit vertically and horizontally, and even across the whole file or multiple files.";;
"Vim keystrokes are fantastic for navigating around a file, and the learning curve isn't all that high for this particular case. Managing buffers, panes, file navigation, etc, takes quite a bit more work before you're blazing fast with it. My suggestion would be to try Sublime Text and then put it into vintage mode. This will allow you to learn to navigate using vim keystrokes but you'll still have Sublime to fall back on for the less common cases that may drive you up the wall when using straight Vim. 

To more directly answer your question, it's just extremely effective for touch typists for text editing. Every IDE or text editor I use I immediately find a plug-in that allows me to use Vim keystrokes because it's far more comfortable than having to use arrow keys or mouse for getting around. ";;
You can do everything without a single finger leaving the keyboard to touch your mouse. Much faster.;;
"This is a specific example, but it helps show the versatility and power behind vim.

I had 15 files spread across 15 different sub folders that needed the same change:  I had to prepend a string to the beginning and append a different string to the end of a variable length block of lines.

Sounds like a lot of work in a normal editor, right?

What I ended up doing was first queuing up all the relevant files with ""vi */text_file"".

I then selected the correct block of lines in Visual Mode (ctrl+v), then entered the following vim command:  "":<','> s/^/string1/ | <','> s/$/string2/ | wnext

The first part prepends string1 to each line in the visual block.  The second appends string2. The third part saves the current file and moves on to the next file in the queue.

What could have taken 30 minutes of mind numbing work was done in a few minutes.  Vim's power comes from trimming mindless work with macros.";;
That sounds really cool! Thanks for the explanation. While other people have talked about this, nobody actually gave an explanation, so that was super helpful in making me understand the power of vim.;;
"As /u/gyroda says,  It's available damn near everywhere and via a terminal.      

As for features, the biggest in my opinion is the way the features operate together. Once you get what is going on you can start chaining basic commands together to do complex tasks.

";;
"The high learning curve is part of the pros as well, because if you program a lot with it, the reward you get by mastering it greatly overshadows the pain you had in the beginning, while with a modern IDE the curve quickly reaches a plateau and you're not that much more efficient after 100 hours or after 1000 hours of using the tool.
Basically with vim (and the proper mindset) you learn new tricks constantly, even after decades of usage.";;
"...That isn't a feature of vim, that's a *bug* in human psychology. We shouldn't *like* getting small rewards repeatedly after lots of grinding. Similarities between your text editor and freemium MMO games are not *good things.*

Having said that, I do like vim--mostly because it doesn't require me to move my hands a lot when typing.";;
"It's a grind for the first like 5 hours, once you have navigation down you're already moving faster than arrow keys (let alone key+mouse).

The experience then just gets progressively better semi-indefinitely. The seconds per operation you can potentially save are well worth the initial hurdle.

The only potential downside is that it will annoy you to use anything else.";;

What I meant is that it would, theoretically, be better if the discoverability of features in vim were such that you knew all potential knowledge in a shorter timeframe. :P;;
The most important pro is that you can lord it over other programmers that use IDEs like children.;;
It just makes it incredibly easy to navigate and change things in your code without ever having to take your fingers off the keyboard. Being able to do things with just a few keystrokes like change things like the inside of block (`ci{`) or select everything to the semicolon later on the line (`vt;`) or perform repetitive task with macros like adding a semicolon at the next 50 lines (`qqA;<esc>jq49@q`) . I don't know, I'm sure there's other workflows and software that will allow you to do this kind of stuff, but vim is the one I know, so I feel much less productive when I'm forced to develop without it (which I am sometimes :-().
I'd recommend running `vimtutor` on the command line and picking it up.  Be patient and go through the steps, and you'll start to see that you can do very fast, powerful things with a few keystrokes.;;

The big feature/thing about Emacs is how extensible it is. *""Emacs is a great operating system, but lacks a good text editor""* is a common joke people make about Emacs, but there's a hint of truth to it. Emacs is very capable of becoming a decent IDE, if you want. People have made (arguably) [the best Vim emulator for it](http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil), so at that point it really is Vim *plus* ***all*** the features of Emacs. It comes with an incredible [organizerote taker/planner called org-mode](http://orgmode.org/) which many people swear by.

So you can construct your Emacs to be very personalized and you do almost anything with it (via extensions/plugins/configuration). It is sort of like its own operating system.

Do you really need that complexity for a configuration file? I've been using the .INI format (from which toml is obviously derived)  for many years. It's served me well, and it's trivial to write your own parser for it, or use one of the many available open source parsers.;;
"There's plenty of reasons to use a more complex format. INI doesn't have very easy ways to deal with lists of complex data, for example. Much easier to use a format that supports the structure of data that you need than to deal with possibly complex string parsing yourself.

OP could consider JSON for an alternative that would probably fit most of the same needs and certainly has C libraries. JSON lacks comments, which is a major limitation, but it's not too much work to allow comments yourself (programs like Sublime Text do this).";;
"> INI doesn't have very easy ways to deal with lists of complex data, for example.

Therefore with the restricted computer I would honestly suggest starting with C or C++ to learn, because your computer should already have these compilers and you just need a text editor  such as notepad in order to create programs and learn the basics.";;

">Why do comments in HTML look like this <!-- (text) -->

Because in HTML everything is either text or a tag that's delimited by a < and >. The HTML comment tag is easy to recognize as a comment by an HTML parser and easy to catch the end of since --> is unlikely to show up anywhere else in a document.

C style comments use /\* \*/ for the same reason: It's really easy to match, and also has the benefit of making it clear where a comment ends to anybody that couldn't use syntax highlighting. (Which in the early days of C was hardly impossible.) The later C style comment of // (I think C++ started that?) was fewer characters and the idea is that it's both fairly easy for the compiler to parse the end of the comment (the EOL) and easy for a human, with syntax highlighting or no, to see the end of. 

Comments preceded by a # are fairly common in UNIX shells because / has special meaning a directory separator to UNIX. Using /\* \*/ or // would be more obnoxious to parse, especially considering that somedir/\* is a valid token that **shouldn't** begin a comment. ";;
"They need to pick something, and it generally needs to work with the syntax first and be easy to parse as well. HTML/XML uses something starting and ending with <> because all tags start and end like that, it makes writing the parser slightly easier and makes things work better, it's especially important when spaces don't matter, you can't use new lines to end a comment.

\# is a single character and not used in C like languages, // is easier to type, both can be ended with a newline. Other languages use something like ;;, but in C that could be correctly parsed as empty statements so it doesn't work.

TL;DR: it's about something that's easy to type and easy to parse";;

Why? I really don't understand your question. Ideally, you want your programming language to hide all messy details from you while also being super efficient in terms of both time, space and other constraints. It turns out this is not really possible, so you sometimes need to make tradeoffs, but I'd be very happy if I could write all my code in a language as easy to use as Python is.

Yeah I can understand this, I guess that I meant some of the concepts that often go with them, such as recursion, indexing arrays and stuff. Perhaps key words are what is meant by fundamentals though.

">People often say once the fundamentals are established one can learn other languages, there's a difference between programming fundamentals and language though, as python fundamentals might include standard library, PEP8, virtual environments and such...  I'm not too sure what programming fundamentals are either - I would imagine implementing algorithms and stuff - though perhaps people literally mean printing out 1 - 10 in a loop and understanding what key words such as if, while and others do.

By fundamentals of programming people mean the conceptual basis of logic and thinking required to determine what to write. If I say: ""Print a list of all prime numbers between 1 and 100"" the 'fundamentals' would be the thinking in your head that breaks it into the sub-problems and determines the most reasonable way to solve it. 

>Do others feel that python is a bit too nice in this sense? And that perhaps one should move onto something else from it ASAP when learning?

I think Python is too nice to learn everything, and that naturally someone intending to be a great programming must eventually move into other languages. Personally I'd go straight from Python to C. (Or if you prefer a trial-by-fire start with C.) C is a really technically simple language; very little syntactic sugar or any of that 'niceness' but also very little in the way of complicated advanced features. It makes you learn a good amount about how the machine actually operates to use it, but it makes you learn little else you don't want to. If you know C you start to understand how the higher-level languages work and I find value in that. 

Also great in that C is the root of a lot of other languages and concepts.

>I don't know C# so perhaps this is regular, but from what I'd read about people saying how nice it was I assumed it was a prettier java for some reason (I get that something can be nice for reasons other than terseness...)

That's all taste. Personally I find Having.Seventeen.Period.Separated.Words.Just.To.Import.Some.Generic.Class to be aggravating and perhaps more importantly just dislike any language almost exclusively maintained by a corporation, but I understand why people do use those languages and do even see them as being elegant in their own way even if it makes me want to shove forks in my eyes.

Yeah I can agree with this, I don't really like the idea of Using C# in Visual Studio on Windows 8, just feels a bit skewed. 

I plan on sticking with Python for now, though I'll go onto something else (as I'd like to try phone apps at some point). One day I might even learn some eLisp :)

"You asked if the less efficient C# version would be more typical. The answer is definitely *yes.*

Sort functions need to be highly optimized because sorting is a huge waste of time for a massive variety of applications. You wouldn't want to write them yourself; someone else will have done that work for you, and you don't want to repeat it--not least because theirs is gonna be faster. 

This is true of most complex algorithms. As a result, most of your code will represent business logic, which tends to be trivial, at least with regard to computational complexity. There's no reason to worry about efficiency, so you instead concern yourself with how easy it is to read and maintain.";;
Thats cool - the first one looks higgledy piggledy to me! The second seems a bit more reasonable though. ;;
"I know that the python community likes to pretend it is, but terseness is absolutely not the only (or even good) measure of what makes a programming language good.

Your post was nothing more than ""yet another python programmer making sure you know python is terse"". Nobody gives a shit if python is terse aside from the python community.

The sooner you learn that, the better.

Tooling and support is what makes a language good and this is why python will die well before java ever does.

Just the same, readability doesn't make a language good either. Many attempts have been had at 4G languages in order to increase readability and they've all suffered the same fate (SQL aside).";;

"Google this question and find a plethora of discussion, advice, opinions and explanations.

It will basically boil down to:

Swift is usually perceived as having a simpler syntax and easier learning curve than Objective C.  Apple has sent out signals that they intend to standardize on Swift going forward.  However, since Swift is still very new, its something of a ""moving target"" and some of the language changes in non-trivial ways as Apple releases new Xcode versions with new compilers.  Being new, there is also less existing code out there to learn from, fewer tutorials and examples, etc.

Objective C is much more established.  It is usually perceived as having a less common syntax and a more difficult learning curve.  It is an older language and lacks some niceties and syntatic sugar available in Swift.  There is a huge amount of existing Objective C code out there, so you will not be able to avoid encountering Objective C if you do anything more than trivial iOS development.  There are a ton of tutorials, examples and open source Objective C code to learn from out there, much more than Swift right now.

My opinion as a professional iOS developer - you will *need* to have at least a working knowledge of Objective C to do anything more than trivial app development, so you'll want to learn at least enough to make sense of existing code that you'll come across.  However, if you're a new developer working on your own, Swift might make you more productive, faster.  And you'd be learning what seems to be an emerging standard for Apple-based development.";;

"Have you read up on the algorithm? It will make more sense that way:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm";;
"Yes i already read that but i'm still lost in the procedure in some codes. Like calling the function *quicksort*

`quicksort(array,0,size-1);`

and here

`  quicksort(array, firstIndex, index2-1);
    quicksort(array, index2+1, lastIndex);`";;
"Quicksort is recursive. Once the array has been partitioned into two halves (they don't have to be halves -- just some arbitrary paritition) where the right half is greater than or equal to the pivot (the ""middle"" that we've chosen -- again, it doesn't have to be the actual middle, but it's most efficient if this is the median) and the left half is less than the pivot, sorting those halves and combining them as `left ++ pivot ++ right` will result in the entire array being sorted.

This is more obvious with an example. Suppose we have the array:

    2 9 0 4 3 1 8 5

And we pick 5 as the pivot. Then the left half (less than the pivot) is:

    2 0 4 3 1

And the right half (greater than or equal to the pivot) is:

    9 8

Now, if we sort those halves, we'd get `[0 1 2 3 4]` and `[8 9]` respectively. Now `left ++ pivot ++ right` is `[0 1 2 3 4 5 8 9]`. All nice and sorted. So we can see how sorting these partitions works. The key is that quick sort will recurively sort these partitions. It does so be continuously splitting these up until partitions are of size 1. This is because partitions of size 1 are always sorted.

Consider using quicksort on `[3 1]`. If the pivot is 3, then we end up with left being `[1]` and the end result is `[1 3]` (sorted). Similarly, if the pivot is 1, then the right will be `[3]` and the end result is again `[1 3]`. So if we keep applying quick sort, we will eventually up with with partitions that are already sorted.

Although in real world code, most quick sort algorithms will use a different sorting algorithm for small partitions.

EDIT: The `++` means ""append"" in the context of lists and arrays. Treat it as pseudocode and not C. In your case, you actually modify the array in-place, so appending is unnecessary. The terminology I used comes from a common way to demonstrate an (inefficient) Haskell quicksort:

    quicksort [] = []
    quicksort (pivot:xs) = (quicksort left) ++ [pivot] ++ (quicksort right)
        where
            left = filter (< pivot) xs
            right = filter (>= pivot) xs";;

        {
            index1++;

Usually you'd avoid using static linking when not needed. An alternative would be to figure out the needed libraries and include them in the appropriate folder (that's why you'll often find programs that come with DLL files).

Since you're on Windows, you've probably noticed numerous programs install a ""Microsoft Visual Studio C++ <year> Redistributible"". It contains the shared libraries that the program needs.

The web console in Firefox can also show requests made by a page (though I don't think it shows their content). The other option is to go through the site's code and try to find where the API call is made.;;
It's really worth *using* a RESTful API before *writing* one. I see a lot of confusion between PUT and POST, HTTP return codes and query params vs JSON body. Doesnt have to be in JavaScript, but it might as well be.;;
cant you do a whole backend in node.js or is it completely different to javascript?;;
"Yes, Node.js let's you use JavaScript for both server and client. Given that JS the closest to ""write once, run anywhere"" it's certainly a good pick.

Use a full featured framework though. JS is a very simple language - there are only a few key concepts and keywords to learn. However, this makes doing complex tasks quite verbose sometimes, so frameworks wrap it up in a library for you.

Based on my personal experience, Angular and Node are suitable for most projects.";;
I didn't know that, thanks for your feedback!;;
"If you're new to programming, the client (javaScript) is a better place to start because it's more intuitive. You can see what's going on more quickly. In server-side programming you're programming on a computer you never see directly.  

More importantly, it's much easier to debug client-side code using developer tools (f12 on many browsers.)  Debugging a server-side program is more challenging. It's better to be an experienced programmer before you move to the server.";;

"As far as learning languages is concerned, the order should not matter. The first language I learned was `FoxPro 2.6`, a rocking DBMS language of the mid-nineties, you may not even have heard its name before. Then came `Visual Basic 6.0` followed by `Java`, `PHP`, `Python`, `C#`, etc. 

What I've learned, besides learning languages, is that there is a skill and pattern to the art of programming itself, and once you master that pattern, it matters not what language you learn and in which order. Think of languages as tools - if your present need is to work on the backend, learn `php` or `python` first. On the other hand, if your next project is going to involve front-end browser-heavy stuff, `JavaScript` is the way to go. Whilst `node` on the backend is also an idea that has gained a lot of steam lately, I'm not going to jump on that bandwagon until `node` has proven itself with some real-world apps.";;

"Perhaps it would help if we tried implementing our own `forEach` method so you can get a better feel for how callbacks work in general. If we were to implement our own version of the `forEach` function, it might look roughly like the following:

    function forEach(array, callback) {
        for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            callback(array[i], i);
        }
    }

    var friends = [""Mike"", ""Stacy"", ""Andy"", ""Rick""];

    forEach(friends, function(eachName, index) {
        console.log(index + 1 + "". "" + eachName);
    });

If it helps, here's another snippit of code that's completely equivalent to the above:


    function forEach(array, callback) {
        for (var i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
            callback(array[i], i);
        }
    }

    function report(eachName, index) {
        console.log(index + 1 + "". "" + eachName);
    }

    var friends = [""Mike"", ""Stacy"", ""Andy"", ""Rick""];

    forEach(friends, report);

I think if we write the code the second way, it's a little more clear what's going on. When we call our custom `forEach` method, what we're doing is passing in the array, and passing in the _function itself_. We haven't evaluated or ran the function yet, we just literally pass in a function, similar to how we can pass objects around in other programming languages without running any of its methods.

Then, the `forEach` function will loop over the array, and repeatedly call the callback or function, passing in the arguments with each call. 

The first version of the code is exactly identical to the second -- the only difference is that we're creating an _anonymous function_ -- we create a function and immediately pass it in w/o having to assign it a name. This is analogous to how some programming languages will let you create inline arrays or inline objects.

When we do `friends.forEach(...)`, pretty much the exactly the same thing is happening -- the main difference is that `forEach` is a method, so you don't pass in the array as an argument. The implementation of `forEach` itself is also probably going to be a bit different, but in essence, it does exactly the same thing as our own custom version -- loop over the array in some fashion, and repeatedly call whatever function you pass in.

Now, how do we know exactly what arguments our callback/function will be given, and in what order? There's no easy way, apart from looking it up in the documentation. ";;
"Welcome to the wonderful world of first-class functions!

In Javascript, a function is a type of value (just like a string, an int, or an object). When you pass your callback into ``forEach()``, it doesn't get called right away -- it just becomes something forEach has access to, and can call at its discretion. It's the responsibility of forEach (not you!) to make sure that your callback actually gets called -- and that it gets sensible arguments passed to it.

So, a naive implementation of forEach might look something like this...

    function forEach(callback) {
      //assuming that 'this' is an Array
      for (var i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
        callback(this[i], i);
      }
    }

Does that make any more sense?";;
">  where is the index getting passed through? 

Somewhere in the implementation of `Array.prototype.forEach` (which is inside the implementation of the JS runtime) is a line that calls your callback, passing three arguments: the current value, the current index, and the array being iterated over.  (Note: JavaScript does not enforce [arity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity) so the fact that in your example the function only takes two parameters is not an error.  It's rare to have a use for the third one, but it's there for when you do.  Many callbacks only need the first parameter, the value, and ignore the other two.)

This is just a fact of how `forEach` was designed.  It's not under your control.  You are passing a function to `forEach`, and `forEach` is going to call that function once for each of the elements in the arrays.  The arguments that it passes are fixed.";;
"This seems like a reasonable testing strategy. To make it easier, you might consider writing the unit tests for your client so that they automatically start up an instance of your server.

If you ever find that running the server for your tests becomes seriously inconvenient (maybe the server is unavoidably slow, and it makes your client tests take a long time), you could also mock out interactions with the server when testing the client. That is, create a ""fake"" server that provides just enough of the real server's behavior to work for your unit tests.

It's mostly down to what works best for you, and your particular app.";;
"I'd pick something with a good ORM, unless you really like maintaining SQL stored procedures.

This is easier in strongly typed languages, because your classes just match your tables, and then your classes also become your models which flows effortlessly into MVC.

Edit: Just remembered that F# has a compile time schema verification step, which might be cool to explore.";;
"Well, Java EE or Spring are absolute overkill. Big platform, big framework - suited for large software. A smaller Java MVC web framework would be [Play](https://www.playframework.com/) (which would also allow you to use the Scala language) and a Sinatra-like (middleware stack, not MVC) framework would be [Spark](http://sparkjava.com/).

In general Java is not actually bad for web development. It's not used widely but at very big high-traffic sites -> [statistics](http://blog.websitesframeworks.com/2013/03/programming-language-statistics-in-server-side-161/). The main reason for this is that Java is a likely choice for big enterprises, but it hasn't the nerdy/coolness factor like, let's say, Ruby.

I personally would love to write web servers in Go. It's a fantastically simple language - one can focus on getting things done. There's little need for third-party packages / little to no dependencies / very strong and well-organized standard library. Easy to deploy en masse, etc. But there are drawbacks: Very few actual developers available, very few frameworks available if you need a bigger one, versioning is not directly integrated into `go get` and no generics mean more repetition for bigger projects. A friend of mine is trying to write an API consumer for worldbank.org and comparable sites - he is feeling the pain of no generics.";;
"Since you already have the Java code it would make perfect sense to go on with Java. A simple spring boot MVC application would be able to set up.

"I would use Python because I know it, but other trendy developers use things like:

- Ruby on Rails (Like Python but probably more popular)
- Haskell (I do not understand this.)
- NodeJS (You can do full stack javascript, which I dont understand why but hey, if it floats your boat)";;
"I'm also a big Python fan for web development. I don't do any data analysis stuff, myself, but I've heard that Python's extremely popular in research applications -- I believe that the [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/) libraries are the tool of choice for that -- and I'd guess there's probably a lot of crossover with what you're going to be doing.

If you're into Java right now, Python would probably be a big adjustment -- I think it's a worthwhile one, personally, but your mileage may vary. Everybody works differently, you know?

More importantly, though: you've got an **awesome** opportunity here. Your job is offering to pay you to do some professional development! Make the most of that: pick out a few interesting technologies, and spend a few days on each. Do tutorials, research, troll some message boards and IRC channels, and get a feel for what your options are... then pick something you feel really good about and dive deep on it.

I was in a similar position a few months ago, and I basically got to handpick a technology stack for a new project. Super rewarding. I'd guess there are a lot of great technology options for your project, so take the opportunity to figure out what *your* dream environment is and chase it!";;

I would say it is whatever you are most comfortable with. This might be an unpopular opinion, but I think it really doesn't make that much of a difference what keyboard layout you use, unless you are writing like thousands of lines of code a day. A mechanical keyboard though is much better than membrane ones, and [this blog post](http://www.daskeyboard.com/blog/mechanical-keyboard-guide/) suggests that mechanical keyboards might reduce your chances of getting carpal tunnel syndrome.;;
"I am certainly most comfortable with QWERTY, but that is only because that is only the keyboard layout that I've used since I was a child. I'm curious about other layouts as I've often find myself fumbling with the brackets and other common programming punctuation, and I also don't mind learning a new layout if that means a more comfortable coding experience in the future.

I was considering switching to Colemak because of the seemingly easy transition and the retention of common keyboard shortcuts on the left hand, but it does not solve my problem regarding common programming punctuation so I won't bother then.

Remapping my caps lock key into a backspace sounds like a good idea though so I will try that.";;
If you are on Windows, you should try using [AutoHotKey](http://www.autohotkey.com/), maybe it might solve your problem. ;;
Honestly, whatever your peers are using. I never go more than a couple of days without typing at another person's workstation, sometimes it's specifically pair programming sessions, sometimes it's just a bug we're working on together because it's something one of us wrote months prior. It's bad enough that some of us use vim shortcuts and others don't, if someone had an entirely different keyboard layout it would be impossible to take the keyboard during a short pair programming session. ;;
Thank you. I did not consider that you often change workstations in a professional setting nor have I heard about pair programming. TIL. I won't change my layout then.;;

"So your trying to put these in a random order, is that correct?

One quick point first: **rand(i)** returns an integer between **0** and **i-1** inclusive, so taking 1 of **sorted.length** is unnecessary.

The problem is the call to *recursive_sort* inside the while loop.

Consider the call *recursive_sort([a, b, c], [])*

*sorted.length* = 3 so we enter the while loop and move one element into *deshuffled*, now *sorted.length* = 2.

Then we call *recursive_sort* again, skip the while loop (the condition is false) and deal with the last two elements, all fine so far.

Now though we return from the second *recursive_sort* and back into the while loop, but then we try to deal with the last two elements again, but they're not there so Ruby gives us *nil* and we put that on the end of the array.

To fix this just remove the *recursive_sort* call inside the while loop.



For future reference Array#sort and Array#shuffle are built into Ruby.";;

What's a value? A number? In general, a good strategy would be to build a hash table with the smaller list and then loop through the larger and check for things already in the hash table.;;
I have two lists of account numbers, and I need to return the account numbers that are in both tables.;;
Do what I said before if the domain of the account numbers is pretty big (which it likely is). Alternatively, if both lists are already sorted, then it would be easy to get the things that are in both. If not, I'd still just do the hash table rather than sorting them.;;
Ok, I guess I don't know how to do this. I understand a hash table is basically an array, right? Just not sure how to implement what you're saying.;;

Software engineers command high salaries because that's what the market demands.  Employment is a win-win scenario where the employee gets a nice salary, and the employer gets someone who puts in 40+ hours a week to deliver value in excess of how much they're paid (which includes salary, taxes, and benefits).  Together, the employee and employer both accomplish something neither party is able to achieve on their own.;;
I hope I can provide them with value in excess of how much I'm paid. I'm guessing they wouldn't have approved the starting salary if they weren't confident that this would be the case? Perhaps they allow for a small ramp up time as I transition from intern to entry level? I'm assuming that is the norm for most companies that intend to make money.;;
"It is normal to employ someone for their potential rather than their current skill level.  Given how well you write and explain yourself, I'm not at all surprised that they see something worth having.

"I'm just a student, but it's been related to me by *several* people that nobody who is qualified feels qualified in this business.

As the adage goes, ""It's the people who think they know what they're doing that you worry about.""";;
"It's not just this field where that occurs. There's a psychological phenomenon called the [Impostor Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) where an otherwise skilled and/or competent individual fells like they're incapable of adequately performing; that they're frauds. 


It's actually relatively common amongst those starting out in a field where they're paired with more experienced (and therefore perceived as more intelligent) individuals.


The other effect you're describing is called the [Dunning-Kruger Effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) where an unskilled individual feels like their skills are greater than they actually are, kind of like inflating their egos through a superiority complex.";;
"I came here to say this.   Apparently Imposter Syndrome is widespread among programmers.    

My theory about this is that once the basics of programming can be grasped, programming requires little comparative skill (for example, I'm in college and my engineering peers work way harder than I do, and learn much more net information).    

However, my internship kicks the typical engineer's internship right in the ass because *Programmers are in high demand, and there is a low supply*.  Most people never bother to really learn how to program.   Supply and Demand makes the world go round.

Sure, people might make a hello world program for fun, but how many actually understand the preproccesor statements like    

> \#include <stdio.h>    

Or the function declarations like     

> int main(int argc, char *argv[])      

I don't think many people do.  The truth is if you understand these things (what they actually mean and why they are written like that) you ARE a qualified programmer for entry level work.  Creating a  complex piece of software from scratch is difficult even for experienced programmers.  But Its important to have a can do attitude rather than an I can't attitude.

I think a lot of us see the resident genius programmer with 30 years experience who can code us under the table and immediately assume we suck as developers.  This just isn't true.

Is this messy, at times? Yes. Some companies try to propose solutions to address this, such as forcing 100% standardization of the toolset. This is silly and the easiest way to piss off your best developers, but it's something I've seen from substandard shops time and again.";;
"Yay for the OneNote!!  I write a ton in my OneNote at work, I probably have around 400 pages exported to a pdf of everything I've written.  Whats great about OneNote is that I can write notes on these basic things, like how to configure environments properly and then share them with the whole team.  Therefore I don't have to repeat the same information multiple times and have to walk through the process multiple times.  Most of the questions I get asked, I just point them to the shared Onenote.  I think its given me some credibility on the team as well as the documentor.  

I also keep notes for day to day tasks and for each issue I work on.  That way if wanted to know the process to reproduce the problem, which files are affected, and other issues with an issue, my OneNote has everything.  The day to day notes help with time  tracking so that I don't mess up my charge numbers and I can be kept accountable if someone where to question my charging.  Cuz no way in hell am I going to remember things from months in the past.  I barely remember tasks week to week.  

And then, everything is searchable.  If I wanted to find a vague fact I may have written down sometime in the past year, I can search for keywords to find more information on the issue.  ";;

"#""I'm an awful programmer""

You're doing it right! Don't change.

It's the dum-asses who think they're always/mostly right that cause the biggest fuckups.

If you're *that* unsure..... crowd-source your algorithm, spot the better developers in the group, and tell them ""I've been tasked X, so I'm going to do it by Y..... is that what you'd do?""

Avoid the ones that go ""NOOOOO! DO it like this!""...

Keep the ones that say ""Hm..... that would work ok - but I found A and B happen which is a pain in the ass to program around. You might be better trying Z.... it'll avoid S, and also you can do W with it!""

Yeah it can be hard to find people who can look at your work like that. My boss has his way for everything, and he cant explain anything in a way I understand. I tend to use the common java libraries for my solutions, and he has coded his own libraries. Which is great, but fucked if I can follow or understand, or learn from my mistakes. So I just keep going, it'll make sense or I'll find a niche eventually. It sucks a bit coz there is no denying the bosses skills... Just hard for me to work with.;;

Right, thanks for the tough love! I appreciate it. I suppose a great deal of my worry is because I'm afraid of not being good enough fast enough.;;

"This is a decent explanation of a fruitful code review process with an excellent engineer. You can spend hours on a chunk of code that they simplify or eliminate in a few moments.  It is humbling, yet the lesson always sticks.

Poker always has been the hardest way to make an easy living. ";;
"What's the worst that can happen? Oh no, they've exposed you and now know you aren't as good as they thought you were! You're fired! Yeah well, you already don't think you deserve the job, so what's the loss. 

Now let's get back to reality. They didn't hire you necessarily because of your amazing coding skills (right now), but because they (meaning your coworkers when you were interning) saw a potential in you that you wanted to learn, and were a good fit to work with the rest of the team. You'd be surprised how much the latter of the two makes more difference than actual skill level. You mentioned the other prior interns being much better than you who have worked there longer, well of coarse they will be, they have more experience. 

Give it six months, then look at code you were writing around now, if six month from now programmer you doesn't think current programmer you was an idiot, then you were right and you don't deserve the job.

(By the way, six months from now, you're still going to think you suck. You'll just realize that you suck less than you did six months ago)";;
"The six month comment is so true. I started a new job 2 months ago which involves a lot of automation and Powershell scripting. When I started I was not familiar with Powershell and programming in general, and I felt pretty worthless.

Well, today I was clearing old activity logs and honestly laughed at all of failed dev/QA jobs I wrote and pushed out. There were literally hundreds of them per project, and they were horribly written compared to what I am doing now. And I know that I still have tons of room for improvement.

OP, I actually think you're at a good point. You suck, but you acknowledge that you suck, which is an important step in not sucking at what you do.

What you need to do now is find someone within your company that can mentor you, someone who doesn't mind having their brain picked. You'll also be surprised how much you can learn from the people you work with without actively trying to learn.";;
Don't sweat it man. The worst that can happen is you accidentally ruin everything and the CEO himself kills you.;;
You'll get better.  Just keep at it.  It is not always easy, either, for big companies to precisely measure programmer output.  A lot of that measurement will be up to you.  When you run across difficult concepts, study them at night and code through them with little projects.;;
As long as they aren't complaining, you already are good enough. But a good employee never stops learning and improving.;;
"My advice to anyone in a specialized industry (programming, video production, etc) is that if you're able to land a position that you feel is over your pay grade and over your head, take it as an opportunity to seriously apply yourself. 

You may have to put in more hours than you're being paid for for a while to get the amount of work done that's required.. But that's okay in the short term.. You are developing valuable skills and your resume which is worth a ton in the long run. 

Apply yourself, try as hard as you can, work harder than your coworkers, maybe spend more time outside of work teaching yourself.. You will thank yourself in 5 years. ";;
Seriously just git gud. ;;
"    $git gud

            gui";;
This is probably the correct answer, even if it is insulting.;;
"I don't think it's insulting at all. Depending on what you work on, or where you work, or what field etc you may very well be expected to solve some problems without much assistance. In times like that you need to know how to problem solve even if the issues you've run into are more or less unknown. At work I was given a piece of equipment that was more or less a black box with pretty shitty documentation and fairly minimal resources on Stack Overflow to guide me. Guess what, you figure it out. You chip away at it until you make some progress and then reassess.

It's not pretty, and it shouldn't be what your job is like all the time but you're getting paid to solve problems you're not getting paid to have everyone applaud you each time you make some plugin. 

It's fine to feel overwhelmed but when you're getting paid $70k then you toughen up and figure it out, or don't.";;
This couldn't be more true. I just started a job to learn an ERP software that to say resources are scarce is an understatement. I was told coming in that I wouldn't have any help because no one else know it as well. I don't make anywhere near 70k but know that when I do figure it out, it's a software that averages 71-110k once you become proficient at it. Good reply haunted. ;;
I thought it was a great response because it was one of those things I really needed to hear. After all, if I'm being paid so well...why wouldn't I just toughen it up? In a way, I feel embarrassed for being a baby in my first post. I appreciate tough love. :) He's like an older brother that I never had!;;

"> Put the concept of ""this is hard for me"" out of your mind. Forever. Never say that again.

If you are familiar with Carol Dweck's work on mindset, this is *fantastic* advice.";;
I will check it out. Thank you.;;
"/u/dimino nailed it with this. 

I also had a lot of doubt when I first moved into a development position. I wanted to quit because I felt like I couldn't keep up and I found programming to be quite hard. The other developers I was working with had been doing it for 8+ years(one of them 20 years) and I thought ""These guys are so smart! What am I doing here?! I'm out of my league!"" Granted this is when I was doing help desk and support for them. After a year of that a development/""management"" position opened up which I was very under qualified for. For some reason they wanted to throw me into a sink or swim situation to see if I could do it. For the next year I worked my ass of learning everything I could about the company and their technologies. Many late nights at the office. For example I had to learn the entire payroll system which is thousands and thousands of lines of code. All undocumented. No comments. No employees with knowledge of how it works and that was just one small part of all the things I'm in charge of. Fast-forward a year and a half later and I now manage a help desk employee, a JR. Dev they just hired for me to train and mentor and almost 20k in wage increases since I started 2.5 years ago. Not to mention the experience I have gained. Now I handle a lot of Project Management thanks to the leadership skills I have obtain over the course of my working life. I enjoy that more than straight up punching code.  Keep working at it and it will get easier and it will pay off. ";;
I am in the exact same boat as you OP. I interned last summer and got hired in September full time. Same role .NET developer. Things are starting to get easier for me, but still hard. Just keep kicking.;;
"On a similar note, my experience with knowledge is this:

Quantum Mechanics is hard, everything else is just time consuming.";;
Can you elaborate? Sounds interesting. ;;
"There's kind of two sides to this... Philosophical reality and just practical reality, both similar but helps to understand the difference.

We have a special ability being conscious creatures; we know what we know. While that may sound obvious, if you look at it deeper, in our universe there is nothing we can't understand, key word being **our**. Everything that you do not understand, you will not understand not understanding because we can't understand something that does not exist to us at all. To put it simply, ignorance is bliss, or an analogy is Schrödinger's cat (Silicon Valley nailed this interpretation of it), something does not exist in our minds until we have made the discovery of (or not) knowing the answer. Have you ever wondered what time it will be on mars when the star Vega goes supernova? That thought never existed in your mind until it was presented and know you feel the need to find (or not find) the answer, but regardless of conclusions, you understand the question and would understand the justification of how someone found the time it *would* be. Everything that is presented to us, is presented because it exists, meaning we can understand it, if we didn't understand *what* something was, we wouldn't understand how to do it.

Which transitions to practical reality... it's impossible for you to *not* to be able to learn whatever it is you want to learn because you understand it exists meaning it doesn't take a special knowledge, it just takes time.

Ever seen those news specials where some kid is 10 years old and can memorize the entire history of all the presidents, states, countries in Europe, etc... You never hear that they made some groundbreaking warp drive that can take us to Andromeda in hours... They are not smarter... they have an ability to shorten the *time* it takes to collect and recount this knowledge.

I've always had this 'theory' but never really discussed it so sorry if I went *too* philosophical on you but returning to my original statement... Quantum mechanics is time-consuming AND hard because it actually stresses the ability of one's mind to *actually* understand rather than stressing one to recollect. It is like trying to imagine a color that humans cannot see... we know they exist but we literally cannot create one in our minds no matter how hard we try.";;

"It normalish.

">If I wanted to work on some code by myself, at work or for my own personal projects, I'd have a hard time. If I wanted to code something from scratch, I'd have a hard time.  

Pretty sure the impostor syndrome only applies to people who are actually skilled/have external evidence of their competence. This guy admitted to not being skilled and not competent. Not all feelings of inadequacy are unjustified.";;
"Exactly. For example, I know that I cannot write great code. I can write mediocre code and will probably get wrong most of the things necessary to do real architecting. The reason is that I don't have enough experience. I don't write everyday yet, I don't understand concepts beyond perhaps the intermediate level, and I certainly can't tell you the computational complexity of a function.

One of the things that I did when creating this account was stop fooling myself about all the work I have to do to become a software engineer. I get the feeling that a lot of people on reddit breathe a sigh of relief when they first hear of impostor syndrome. It irks me. I sound like I know what I'm talking about in person all the time but that's because I understand the *philosophical* aspects of software development and technology.";;

"Spoiler: That's super normal.   

Being an adult is just knowing when it's ok to act like a kid, and when it's not. ";;
Fake it til you make it. You'll get over it once you realize most people are as clueless as you feel.;;
This x10.  I'm convinced that 95% of devs are faking it, and 5% of devs write all useful, maintainable code for the rest to cut and paste and bugger up.  BTW, I'm pretty sure I'm in the 95% myself. ;;
"Income is not linear, it's exponential. People on the ground floor make minimum wage, the people above them are barely any smarter, but they make more like $14 an hour. Then the people above them are barely more capable and they are pulling in $22 an hour. If you have been living in a world where everyone you know makes $14 an hour you will be shocked and appalled at the lifestyles richer people get to have.

The people who said, ""70k a year?.. yea that sounds fair."" are living in a world where everybody they know makes $100 - $250k a year. They imagine what live would be like on 70k and shudder at the thought. (Nevermind that median **household** income is ~50k)

I think it's terrible but this is how it is. The higher you go the bigger the leaps in pay.";;
"Dude, you got the job and as hidden you think your terrible talents are, the company can see right through you and have put their faith in your ability to grow as a developer. I'm going to go ahead and guess you aren't the first person who believes they are in over their head at a new job but have some faith in their hiring staff if nothing else. Just keep moving forward, and hitting small goals and improvements. Sooner or later you will be the one people go to for answers.

Also Sir_not_sir posted the psychological phenomena that is occurring and its pretty common. ";;
Any specific examples of what I could consider small goals and improvements? ;;
"Let me preface this by stating that I'm not a coder/programmer...just happened to be subbed to this forum.

My friend graduated from college a few years ago w/a CS degree. I helped get him a job at one of the top financial companies in the world. A college friend's sister worked there. Blah blah blah. 

Here's the fun: He felt like OP. That He didn't deserve the money they were paying him. 

Short story shorter (without typing too much that would certainly derail my point, as I know how the internet loves side stories): He quit. He felt like he was an outcast and failing. 

Asked my friend's sister her thoughts. She was like ""....his bosses loved him and were baffled that he left""

What does this mean? It means that as long as the folks who are paying you love you...just shut the hell up and keep grinding away. Let them fell on the sword or swing it when they need to. NEVER FEEL GUILTY ABOUT NEGOTIATING PAY!

"Hey, you're kinda like me. I also recently got a job that pays 84K with work in C#/VB.NET/SQL Server. I'll be working on their back-end shipping software. I'll share some of my experiences so far; I'm on my second week. So far I've been shadowing my manager and learning the lingo that goes with the position; after all, if you don't KNOW the product how can you possibly be expected to code for it? You won't know what the users want etc. Up front they told me that the first 90 days I won't be doing any real coding, they'll sit me down with various departments for like a week and I'll learn how they use the software I'll code for. You'll learn about how the system currently works, where are there deficiencies, and how will the architecture change 6 months to a year or more down the line; high level stuff.

The manager introduced me to the overall architecture (N-Tier) for the company, I've been in a meeting where they discuss which servers to keep and license management, etc. The biggest trouble I think any developer has when they start is getting acquainted with the publishing / testing flow. You know, how do I debug, which server do I use, how do I get access to those servers, how do I pull and push code in this IDE, and so on. Reading the code shouldn't be THAT hard and you shouldn't be writing intense queries in sql server since the DBA will handle those. In fact, sometimes you won't even be making UX choices because you'll have a UX person there that'll say this UI/UX looks like it would be best and you'll code it up. Definitely the hardest thing is piecing together everything about how the tables, views, and code interact. You'll spend more time stumbling through that than the actual code base in the beginning. I've seen the code my manager codes on and it is not complicated at all.";;
"You're on point when you say that the hardest thing is piecing together the tables, views, and code. It has been a challenge for me to get a grasp on this, and after five months I feel like I've barely scratched the surface of the codebase and the technology. Thanks for the encouragement! Sometimes reading the code is hard because I have to figure out what it is doing even when there is no documentation (which is almost always) and even when the person who wrote it isn't accessible (which hasn't been a problem thankfully). 

My biggest problem, I think, is that I forget stuff fast. If I'm assigned a bug, I'll find it and fix it but I'll forget how I did it after a week or two. If I had to add a new model or if I had to add a new view in the DB, I'll forget the syntax for doing these things, and I'll have to go to stack overflow to refresh my memory. I feel like I don't often have the opportunity to repeat the same kind of task enough times to remember how to do stuff. 

For example, I know what the Entities framework is and I've used it before...yet if I was asked to reproduce some code adding a new model or using LINQ to get some data...I'd be stumped without old code I wrote as reference. I have to refer to older code or the internet to remember the syntax even though I remember the technology itself. I suppose this is my fault for not practicing enough, so I will definitely be practicing like a madman.

Edit: And congrats on the job! That's a really nice gig. :) ";;
Do it long enough and it will all stick.  .Net is pretty large so it's natural.

Hey man I just want to say thanks for this post. I have been at my first out of college dev job for about 4 weeks now, and am feeling the exact same way, just so useless and not worth it for the company. It's been a major source of stress for me so far. For me the worst part is that the company is hiring new people constantly, but not many fresh out of college, so most the other new hires have actual experience and so are useful after just a week or so... whereas me, not so much. Anyway I just wanted to say thanks because your sharing of your story helped me feel less bad about my situation so hopefully my story can do the same for you :P I'm sure in time we will both have some idea of how to do our jobs haha;;
"Want to get better?  Practice!  Grab your balls and scream like a man.  Also, consider the level / amount of work you do compared to your coworkers with equivalent experience, not compared to other people doing other jobs.  And consider what ""adult"" expenses you'll likely soon have: a mortgage! plus paying to heat and cool and entire house, maybe.  plus a dozen other things.  70k goes pretty fast.  If you feel guilty, study more at home and master the tools you're working with at work.";;
I grabbed my balls and screamed like a man, but I don't feel like a better programmer yet. What should I do next?;;
Maybe robotfarts needs to give our balls a good yank so we can figure out how to do it properly. For heaven's sake, I barely know how to code, how am I supposed to know anything about grabbing balls?!;;
The senior devs already coded a ball-grabbing script.;;
You won't know until you try.;;
"You're not squeezing hard enough.

I love that username SarahC is giving out ball grabbing advice!;;
I sincerely would like a demo.;;
Grow a very sparse mustache and become incredibly annoying to your coworkers.  You'll level up quickly.;;
Do it gently, softly.;;
70k definitely will go pretty fast once I start paying down my debts and covering living expenses for myself, but it's still pretty good for a starting salary if I do say so! Thanks for the encouragement, as well. I will definitely be practicing after hours, especially seeing as I enjoy writing code even if it is intimidating! ;;
Isn't there a stat where people become happier and happier with pay until 70k and then there is no difference in happiness after the 70k mark? Also, it may have to do with the fact that 70k can allow someone decent living conditions? Granted that isn't taking into account the college debt/whatever other debt he may have accrued over the years. ;;
Yes, I recall seeing that.  I didn't mean he'd be poor at 70k, more that he'd wouldn't have a Scrooge McDuck money pit while everyone else in town toiled like ancient Egyptian slaves.;;
This is a non-issue. If the people who hired you can pay that much, they're probably smart enough to know how much THEY'LL earn from you.;;
You'll soon learn there's people who know even less than you or are even more useless and earn twice your salary. If your employer is paying you X, it means you earn him mX with m > 1. No company's a charity to developers. ;;
"You think you tricked them into hiring you, but they are actually making a good bet that you can get up to speed quickly (5 months experience with you working for them). Once you're up to speed and start moving to the next level you'll be worth way more than 70k, right?? 

My advice is to set yourself a few short, mid, and long term programming/career goals - personal goals, not just what they want you to work on. Some quarterly goal of publishing a decent-sized personal project (for example). Get yourself discovering new things, strengthening existing skills, etc. In a few years you'll wake up and be on the other side of 40. Get crackin.

"It's normal to just feel like that. 

And don't feel guilty. They wouldn't pay you that much if they weren't making significantly more off what you are making. You deserve more, just like everyone you work with probably deserves more.";;
"One thing to keep in mind is that you don't have to be technically good at something to be of a great value to a company. To most managers its more important that your someone they find friendly and that they can shoot the shit with. If your any bit productive and you get along with your co workers you will do fine. 

Chances are the people who sign you pay cheque don't have any idea what you do or how competent you are with it. As long as your not a problem or shit disturber they don't care. 

Do your part but you don't have to be the one who solves all the problems. They are silly enough to pay people much much more to solve any real problems and some day you may be lucky enough to be one of those people. For now just keep your head down and be a cog in the machine.

It has taken me nearly 10 years to figure all this out.  I use to want to be some technical hot shot who solved everyone's problems. This just raises expectations and makes things bad when you do eventually fail at something. Its much better to be modest and have people expect nothing from you. 

Another thing I've learned is that you don't have to be good at things, you just need to be good at finding help when you need it. This is why some absolutely useless people make it to the top in business. They simply find the right people to do each critical parts of a task for them. Its amazing how much more people will do for someone they like and how little they will do it for. We tend to generally like people who are modest and seem incompetent. ";;
"One of my favorite creative mantras: ""If you're not scared, you're not doing anything interesting.""

Everybody feels this way sometimes, especially with a new job. Just keep kicking ass. You'll be fine.

(and sorta rich... I should work on my resume...)";;
I feel the same. It's strange but I also think it's somewhat normal. I'm 22. The next youngest guy in my office is 52. All my coworkers have been doing this since the 70s. I can't expect to be as knowledgeable as them. All I can do is learn as much as I can each day. ;;
"As someone who has worked a variety of positions, trust me, there's a reason you're getting paid that much. I've been at companies where every major release breaks something serious and costs a lot of sales. You know why that happens? because they pay their devs so little that they just *don't give a shit*. Congratulations, you give a shit and you want to do your job right. That puts you above a surprising number of the population.

That being said, *earn* your pay. Reward the company for treating you well, and your employment will continue to improve.";;
I definitely will, thanks for the insight! I really do intend to be as valuable as possible. Who knows, maybe after a year or two I'll be much better and they'll give me a raise! ^_^;;
"People have said this, the inverse of this and more, but I feel it's important:

You are worth something. As a worker, doing your effort and trying as hard as you can, you are worth whatever the company that hired you wants to pay (and more! I mean: I'm a union guy in a country where almost 60% of the population is organized) for you. But not only that, that you feel insecure is good! You should never feel like you've ""completed the game""!

The skills you've shown so far, although they also are social skills in that you've learned through others, is exactly why you are viable for the job! Continue doing that: if you do that, maybe someone else feels comfortable asking for help and you've contributed to creating a great work environment!! Keep up the good work! :))";;
Curious - did you get a degree in engineering or related?;;
I'm currently a senior in college. I will be graduating after two more semesters. I am majoring in computer science. I interned for about five months and they made me an offer after that.;;
"So you're not even finished with school and already have a full-time job that pays 70K a year?

Either you're a brilliant programmer, or extremely lucky. Anyway, you're something special since not a lot of college graduates are able to get jobs like that after graduation.";;
It also really depends on where he is, with cost of living and all. I see entry level dev jobs in NYC posted at $80,000+.;;
"I sure would love to see those job postings. Remember, there should be entry level jobs, for not-yet college graduates.

All I see categorized under entry level, are technically junior positions marketed as ""entry"" to a) broaden the pool of applicants and b) lower salary demands.";;
I think the fact that you are so concerned about this shows why the company was willing to hire you in the first place. They see that you genuinely care and genuinely want to be better, and they are willing to invest in you because they see your potential.;;
I am stunned by how similar your situation is to mine. Every single sentiment - from the slow pace to the lack of skill to the high salary to the feelings of inadequacy. I am amazed that I even got offered a position and I'll only start to believe that it's permanent when I've been there for a year. Maybe. Anyway, all that is to stay that I guess this stuff does happen irl so take some encouragement from that. Keep trying really really hard - I know I do, then when I get frustrated and want to give up- and hopefully things will work out for us. Pm me anytime if you want to chat.;;
"Imposter syndrome plus you actually are incompetent....for now.

As long as you know you aren't measuring up- then you're in good shape.  Coming to terms with your fallibility is the first step to improving.  

At the last company I worked at, it took me at least a year before I felt reasonable...

"Don't worry about it; they are aware of your skills and they recognize what you can grow into. You are learning and getting better, and perhaps just as important, you are a fit for their culture and (most likely) pleasant to work with. It is a significant investment to hire a new employee, and they made that assessment *after* evaluating your current abilities for an extended period, and more specifically, your potential to **grow** within their organization.

The skills you speak of will come with time, along with *confidence in yourself*. You'll slowly feel like you're gathering comfort in your role, and although new projects may seem daunting at first, you'll start recognizing little pockets of familiarity carved into each new project you tackle. It might be some way of needing to organize data that you've used, some micro-system or design pattern you've inadvertently coded twice before, or perhaps just familiar integrations that keep popping-up. Maybe you'll learn a new language or start banging-out awesome devops scripts. Whatever it is, you'll build-out a tech tool-belt complete with the confidence to approach the unknowns with eagerness rather than uneasiness. You'll wake-up one day and find yourself *starved* for the thrill of working on projects and feeling part of the way you do now.

As other posters are pointing out, it's *extremely natural* to feel unsure of yourself, especially when first starting out. Senior devs seem to know all the little things about all the big stuff, and it feels like an insurmountable dream do one day be in their shoes. But you'll get there. It likely won't even take that long to reach a point where you'll start answering some of *their* questions about this or that or something you recently worked-on. You'll feel **useful**. You'll feel like you belong and that you *do* deserve the salary you have now. In fact, pretty soon you'll feel like you deserve more ;)

You're young, and the world is your heap space; I hope you allocate the fuck out of it.";;
You can give me your salary if you feel guilty. I help you lessen your, you help me financially. Win-win situation.;;
Programmers are in short supply. Be thankful your company isn't on the H1-B bandwagon.;;
"Learn quickly and learn often, and very soon you'll be a productive member of the team. 

For best results, I recommend trying to get in good with 1 or 2 senior debs who will work with you. They're basically a learning multiplier.";;
"Perfectly normal. lol.  I'm serious.  As long as you didn't lie on your resume, it's all good man.  They should know who they're hiring.  And believe me, you'll always need help from time to time and there is so much to learn. 

";;
Hi Op! Let me tell you that this is normal when you enter a new field as programmer. I came from cobol to java development 2 years ago and got a high salary even when I didnt know much. Today two years later I am already much faster and know the java stuff better and slowly get the feeling I am worth my money. Just stay calm and do your best to learn but also realize that learning to code is a slow process. In the end you are in the best possible situation (like I was): you get paid for learning to program. Think how many people would love to say that about their jobs :-);;
"It sounds like nothing's wrong with you. I've got no clue about programming (hence I'm on here), but they wouldn't have offered $70,000 base pay plus benefits all willy nilly. Just learn as much as you can about what you've got to do with the product, and be the best team player you can be, as well. Also, it's not ""maybe in that time I'll be better,"" it's a simple fact that in time you will be better.";;
Congratulations. Keep up the learning!;;
You'll get there lil guy!!!;;
sounds great;;
"As an entry level programmer who's been working about a year, I still think I'm a terrible programmer and I don't think that's far from the truth, I'm not nearly as good as some of my peers from my software engineering degree, but regardless, I've learned so much in my time working and the company likes the work I do, so I'd say keep going. Experience and time programming is everything. The more you do it, the easier it comes and the quicker you learn. 

Congrats on $70k though, that's crazy good";;
I've been out of college for the past year. Started in a paid internship at an agency here in Dublin right after college and while they wanted to keep me on they couldn't merit adding more staff as they had their first downturn. Since then I've been working full time since last Autumn and I still think I am an awful programmer (PHP/Laravel) but I keep going and trying. At times I do wonder if I have what it takes but I manage to get everything done and done nicely. My boss who is a 15 year experienced dev is happy with my progress, says that I am doing well at a nice pace and its about moving into more advanced work as time goes on. With a payrise of course. He's even talking about getting in another Junior to take over my work as I move on what he's doing so he can phase out being a developer and actually run the company.;;
">Simply put, I feel like I'm definitely not deserving of $70,000 a year. That's insane.

Instead of feeling bad about it, try rubbing your hands together and muttering 'Heh heh. Suckers.' to yourself now and then. Seems to work for some people.";;
"I'm you, except in the past. I'm currently at the internship part of the story, and I feel the same way. When they told me that I got the job and that I'd be making $24/hr, I nearly fainted. That's the most I've made in my entire life! I'm saving up to buy my first car! I can actually help with bills at my parents' house! I can afford to buy sushi when I'm having a bad day! THIS IS AWESOME!

But then here I am, almost perpetually unsure how the workflow goes, repeatedly running around to find the solution to a problem or a certain man page that holds all the answers I need before breaking down and asking for help, which almost always results in a 5-second-easy-right-in-front-of-your-face answer from the senior devs. It's crazy masochistic sometimes, and I'm trying to get to a level where I don't feel stupid for asking what I'm doing wrong. There's a lot to learn, re-learn and adapt to. I'm almost always on stackoverflow, piggybacking on old questions, filling in the blanks in my head.

I'm saving this thread because there's a lot of good advice and it's giving me hope. Thank you so much for vocalizing my worries and anxieties that come with entering the industry for real for the first time. I get that there's imposter syndrome common in people who are well-established in the field, but they're *established in the field*, so it's hard to relate sometimes. I'm glad that newbies like us share similar feelings. Here's to us going strong and never quitting!";;
"I was at the exact same position an year ago. The company survived me, haha. I did some good work over time, not much, but I feel I made a contribution. Never had a problem with my supervisor or my boss. I was so stressed at first because of that feeling of guilt. Constantly had to tell myself ""It's not your fault, the company made a mistake. It is a win for you - money and opportunity to learn, take it."" I had said to my boss as he hired me that I do not feel confident in my abilities, yet he put me on the job. I left last month with a parting gift and assurance that the door is always open for me.

What I am trying to say is that what you are experiencing right now is somewhat common and normal. Do your best to learn. Ask for help when you feel like you are going nowhere with a problem, ask questions and clarifications even when you have done the job but it's not fully clear to you what, how, why happens. It is expected of you not to know things, it is good to try to learn them and it makes good impression.  ";;
We could just trade jobs?;;
This actually has nothing to do with programming, this is just business. It's a bizarre reality, that in the real world, *you don't get what you deserve*. If you do, it's merely by coincidence. You, me, everyone.... **we don't get what we deserve. We get what we negotiate**.;;
That's on your employer. Either you'll rise to the challenge, or get fired. Work hard, and don't worry too much, things will work themselves out.;;
At any place that has good sense in hiring, they're hiring the person you will be 6 months, a year, 5 years, 10 years from now.  Not necessarily who you are right now.  If properly motivated you will be producing much more than $70,000 of value for your company very soon, if you aren't already.;;
"""I can barely finish tasks""

You have tasks done?

You may be more valuable than you think.  Programming has a very humble culture as an industry.  I guarantee that little work that you've done is probably more holding of value than the work I have done and I make quite a bit more than you.

Here is the thing, you agreed to do work for a certain rate.  The company feels that this work has been done adequately, and has chosen to kept you on at that rate.

If others are advancing faster than you, they will likely see the value they are bringing, start demanding higher rates.  If they have advanced that much farther, the company may give them the higher rate or position before you.


But that is the worst that will happen.  Programming is way too hard to recruit good people to be letting an entry level developer who's already trained and completing work go just because they are slower than peers. 

So be friendly!  You may be a bit slower right now, but you can make up for it with great connections and communication.  Many times someone who is good at communicating and managing is 100x more valuable than the most efficient code monkey in the world.  

It is part of the learning process, and you are more valuable than you think.  If you are happy keep bloody at it!";;
I just like to remember that I work with people who couldn't even figure out how to change their background picture even after they Google it. ;;
Congratulations!;;
Keep working at it and don't compare yourself to others.  Compare yourself to yourself.  Are you more competent at programing than you were last year?  Have you heard of imposters syndrome? http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome;;
Revel in it. You're making $70K/year. People often don't get so lucky. When I started out, I felt the same way. You'll pick things up as you go.;;
You're entry level, give it some time and you will improve;;
This thread is making me calm down quite a bit. I am about to interview for a developer job this week, but I just feel extremely intimidated due to my lack of experience. ;;
Are you me? oh wait, you're getting paid way more. It sounds like you're doing the exact same kind of stuff that I'm doing. Only you write one hell of a lot better than I do. I'm awful too, but you will improve. If you like the job, keep it. Worse they can do is give you good critique and you can take that and go.;;
"seems like a good start, it should be hard or your not going to grow 
trust me, I coasted for 5 years or so essentially zzz at work, having finally moved on i wish i did it 4 years ago. ";;
Think of it this way. You getting paid to learn. Better than college where you have to pay to learn.;;
Preach it.;;
Nobody comes in as a junior dev able to instantly pick up a code base and start churning out code. It takes time to get familiar with the code base, the language (if it's new to you), coding styles, corporate culture, etc. They saw something in you that perhaps you don't and want you there. You have to remember that you're a junior dev and people will want to help you along.;;

"Hi there. I am just barely starting getting into programming (Like I will shortly be attempting a ""Hello world"" lol. But I think you are going to do just fine. I'm sure the company had an interview process and they did hire you because they believe in you. Can you go to your manager and just tell them you feel a little over your head? I don't know where I heard this but I heard it said that you should surround yourself with people that know more in a field than what you know. Something like that anyway.... good luck and congratulations!!!";;
"There's nothing wrong with you at all. I think most decent programmers look at their pay check from time to time and think ""I'm being paid *this much* to play around with a computer and make stupid programs?!"".

It *is* hard, though. It's supposed to be. You're not being paid 70k to think your job is easy.  

Then you learn, and what you were doing isn't hard any more. But there are so many things that you don't know yet that there will always be something that is hard for you which you're going to need to learn next.  

A year or two of experience will easily improve your productivity by 100-200%, so don't compare yourself to others on job title alone.

It's normal to feel inadequate in an entry level position, and it's also normal not to, but remember that you're not the ultimate judge of your performance.   

If you have more experienced colleagues that you feel you can trust (not entry-level — you want someone who talks from actual experience), talk to them over coffee/lunch/beer about how you're getting along.

And you say you *already worked with them*.  They knew you, they knew your work, they made you an offer, and gladly accepted your 70k salary.

They wouldn't have done that if they thought you were inadequate.

So relax, learn, be happy, enjoy being happy.";;
Then do whatever you can to deserve it! Work hard and learn so that you don't need to depend on external help.;;

I felt the se when I started my latests job in cyber security. That was 1.5 years ago. Now I've got so much on the table  I wish I could still claim ignorance.

Are you relying on other for basics or for integration with existing code? If the latter, don't fret. If the former, don't worry too much. Focus on why what they tell you works. ;;
">Granted, they've been there for a year or two so maybe in that time I'll be better.

You would be absolutely amazed how much you can learn in one year. Especially thrown into a role that is challenging, and even more so when just starting out. One of the most uplifting things for a programmer to do is to look back on their work from a year before and see how much they have learned and what things they might do a little better. If the other entry level developers have a year or two on you I wouldn't for a second compare myself to them, especially if they have been around the architecture of your system. Coding aside, one of the biggest learning curves is just learning how your company specifically does things that may be a bit foreign to you. In any case, all of the things you have listed that you are apprehensive about? Look them up! Take notes on the job when things aren't clear to you, jot down terms or technologies that you may have never heard of before. We were all there at some point, just the fact you posted this shows that you care enough to want to do a good job. A lot of developers without much work ethic wouldn't care one bit about being in your situation. ";;
"I am not a programmer but since in my opinion your problem is not a programing one I will give you advice. 

You have to learn to ""not give a fuck"". Your job requires perfection, but that is not achievable. You can not be perfect programmer. You can not be perfect worker in any field. Difference is that you programmers are trying to be perfect, and inevitably you end up in depression and you burn out, because that is not possible. 

Everybody saying it is impostor syndrome is fueling the idea that you have to be perfect, they only say that you are better than you think you are. That is not true. You are as good as you know you are. It is ok to be that way. You have to face the fact that programming is hard, complex task which can not be done in top level by single person. Everybody is good at something and you all help each other in your team, that is how it has to work. 

You have too high salary? PERFECT. Your programming is not your purpose of living, it is a way you provide for your family. It is a work. Goal of your work is to earn money, not to get praised by others. 

One last thing, you are comparing yourself to other more experienced coworkers. That is wrong. No surprise it leads to loss of confidence. You can not be better than everybody else you meet around you, that is idea mistakenly developped by school system and your past. You have only to be little better than you have been month ago. Then you are moving forward and improving. That is enough. 

So to sum it up, dont try to be perfect, stop feeling guilty for not being perfect, enjoy your money and think LESS about your work. ";;
"That's fine. I just got an entry level position making 40k a year and I feel like I know jackshit. I've done a few small things for my team but the company decided that I need to do this new lab in their training program before I can ""graduate"" the program. I have no idea what I'm doing. You'll be fine. ";;
"First, any skill is learned. Especially development. To say you are awful is being too hard on yourself IMO. Like anything else you should give yourself time to gain confidence and grow your skill set.

A few questions that you did not discuss:

Do you have a solid mentor at work? You mentioned ""the team"". Are you able to talk to a co-worker about this (certainly would not start with your boss). Leave the money out of it. 70k is NOT a lot of money, even for a mediocre developer.

You said you are happy. That is all that matters. Keep learning, and if you wake up one day and are not happy, go do something else. The fact that you live at home with very little expenses means you should be socking savings away like crazy. I would be foolish not to remind you that a nice cushion in the bank is never a bad thing when you are questioning your career.";;
I feel the same sometimes, I just got offered this job two months ago and sometimes I feel undeserving, but as long as you keep learning and progressing, you'll no longer feel that way. Like everyone else said, they hired you for a reason, now show them that you want to stay.;;
You are lucky, I am going on my second year at this company and I make 40k and struggle to make ends meet.  I am current working on my portfolio so that I can start applying elsewhere, I just don't have enough time to do it.;;
It's called Imposter Syndrome, look it up, you'll feel better.;;
"When i started with my apprenticeship i was so useless in my company. I had no real programming experience and just slowed everyone down. This is quite normal during that time so i did not worry about anything but what i did was asking if i could do something new. Not because i was bored of everything but because i wanted to become good in a certain field where i could help out the senior developers.

What happened was that i looked into the (then new) silverlight, made some stuff in it, looked up advantages and told everyone where we should, could or should not use this technology. Since it was silverlight it pretty much sucked and we never used it but for some weeks i learned to stay on my own feed, be an expert in something and i transferred this way of thinking into further projects. Could you maybe ask your company if they want to try out something new that you can look into?";;
"Man, I'm the exact same, but I have been at my company for ~3 years!  I only earn 2/3rds of your salary though.  I do ""jack of all trades"" work here though, not dev specifically.  Kinda pisses me off, but I have gotten a lot of exposure in many different areas.";;
I think you should stop being so hard on yourself. If you think you are a lousy programmer, then fix that. Do things that you know will make you a better programmer. Subscribe the Pluralsight, start reading some books, and do a side project outside of work. Some things that have really kicked up my motivation recently are self help books that really help me in trying to better myself. Some companies will sometimes hire someone not based on how much they know, but how much initiative they show to learn and better themselves.;;

Work your ass off, stop going out, study at home, save up the money you would have otherwise blown on drinking at bars, and enjoy your job. You don't really go down in salary with programming jobs and your next one may very well be six figures. Congrats!;;
Pretty normal for any sort of profession, especially at the beginning. It's good that you're not a blowhard or think that you're always right, but relax. Maybe try to speak to your manager just to get a feel of how you're doing, if you're concerned about your performance.;;
I'm surprised no one has said this yet, but the company already knew you sucked when they hired you. If a company was looking for expert coders out of college they wouldn't ever find enough developers to match their expectations. They knew you sucked when hiring you, but they made an investment. They expect you to work and learn. When you become better, you'll pay will go even higher. Just hang in there. ;;
"There's a lot involved with professional software development, especially if you have to deal with multiple layers or are full-stack.

Your eyes will open up shortly.  Give it about a year.";;
The fact that you want to get better will push you past half of the other newbies.  I'm surrounded by college hires where I work, and half of them have no desire to learn any coding and keep trying to do administrative things instead.  Rather than see your insecurity as a problem, use it to push yourself to learn.  Over time you'll notice that the things that seemed daunting in the past are now simple, and facing the unknown will become a treat rather than a terror.;;
You knew them before, they were aware of your flaws. Seems imho you've been hired since you're eager to get better since you're aware of your flaws, to learn yet respect the hierarchy of the rest of the team. Hiring someone better who would constantly dispute with the rest of the team isn't a lot more profitable neither. However, to keep the job you do need to push an extra mile and try to keep progressing personally. Start with smaller stuff, and give yourself time before you'll be able to handle larger bits.;;
"Hey there. I have exactly been in your shoes few Years back when I was starting to work. I am not a developer but a Mechanical design engineer, I was recruited out of college and was paid a butt ton of money at that time and I never felt more completely useless. Everyone around me was far smarter than me and had fancy degrees from fancy colleges. I am told this is called as the imposter syndrome and even the very best have this! 
So pull yourselves up and keep doing what you are doing, remember there is nothing like an intellectual ceiling what you lack in an area you can make it up by putting an extra effort in it. But first relax and believe in yourself, set reasonable targets for yourself. And best of luck.";;
"By the time you get to 30 and witness the absolute dumb fuckery that gets produced by $2k/day consultants, time and again, then you'll realize that - even if you fail - the amount the company has burnt on you is much much less than the amount they would have burnt through for others.

Relax a bit. It won't be great if you don't catch up speed/ability-wise but, honestly, your salary is small fry to them in the grand scheme of things.

edit: I don't work in programming, but talking about consultants in general. I got rid of our £500/day consultant recently as the work they were doing was shocking.";;

Again, this is their call to make, and if they feel this is fair you should take it.  If they feel you're the person for the job and you want the job, then you're the person for the job.  Keep on building both soft and hard skills, and you will get there.";;

"> I can barely finish tasks on my own without taking 50%-100% more time than the other entry level developers.

How do you know your tasks aren't just 50%-100% harder?

I think the fact that you CAN get things done by yourself is the important part here - you'll be able to do them faster as you know the system you're working on better and just become a better programmer.

I'm in a very similar position to you (recently was hired full time after 8 months of working as a co-op student) and trust me when I say that knowing the code makes a HUGE difference in how fast you can work on it in a team setting. So if the other entry level programmers have been working there a year longer than you, that's a massive advantage for them and they should be pumping out code faster than you.

You can't expect to be able to make code changes to a complex system without a pretty clear understanding of how things work. The other hires who've been there longer should already have a great deal of this knowledge in the areas they work while you may not yet. Therefore they'll be finishing things faster.

Maybe you are also just a worse coder than the others, but again, they have had more practice and should be better.  Focus on yourself and doing everything you can. If the company thinks you're not pulling your weight they'll fire you, otherwise you can probably assume you're doing as well as they expected and are earning your pay.

"HTML is a markup language that describes your webpage, so the browsers know how to display it. The browser needs a way to know what you want to display as a header, paragraph, table, etc. so you use the tags to distinguish what you want as a header, paragraph, table, etc.The browser will look for those HTML tags to know how to present the information.

The limits of a markup language is that it is ""designed for the processing, definition and presentation of text."" Therefore if you want any logic logic like ""if the user click this button, then display a new paragraph"", ""when the time is midnight display the secret message"", etc., you need some kind of general purpose programming language like Javascript. Any time there's some kind of logic involved, you'll either need a programming language on the client or server side. Javascript is a common client side language and php is a common server side language.

So back to your question, you can use HTML to visually display what you need on a website statically. If you need to apply some logic to your website, you will likely some kind of programming language like Javascript in addition to just HTML.";;

* lack the maturity and experience to really know Java

* lack the maturity and experience to make well-informed opinions of Java

* may have had frustrating experiences with Java, leading to a negative opinion of the language

"Java is everywhere.

Financial, aerospace, billions of embedded devices, and pretty much anything of significance on the web you've ever used (LinkedIn, Twitter, Google, eBay, Amazon, etc).

They're sought after because Java is in demand pretty much everywhere.";;
"Here's a small list:

-Java spread far and fast    
-Java is really hard to mismanage from a memory standpoint compared to C++ / C (which tended to be it's most direct competitors when it originated).  
-Developing in Java (as a result of the above) tends to be a bit faster than in straight C / C++.  
-The performance of Java has improved over time and while it's still pretty far from C / C++ in terms of startup time, it's loop efficiency has come a LONG way.   Don't expect to see HFT market apps written in this any time soon, but it's plenty fast enough for desktop computing.  
-Applets were pretty rad before all the billion security vulnerabilities.  
- JNLP's aren't worse than aids and tend to be better than a lot of auto-update scripts I've seen.  
- The language is portable, so in theory (not necessarily in practice) you can write once and deploy to multiple operating systems, this isn't the case with other OOP languages when you deal with memory management...unfortunately.  
-Maven is a BITCH bit it's gotten better over the years...   
- A lot of enterprises use old stacks where you coded your desktop apps in java, to connect to Oracle Databases, running on Sun equipment....My old job was a good example of that.  MAJOR data warehouse, Desktop Java, Presented in Mixed Adobe / JSP environment, pulling data from 2 Oracle Exadata's. 
- As others have said, good java developers are pretty rare.   The stuff that most employers want is REALLY hard to get experience with if you're doing a small project.   (How are you going to get ORM experience without building out a full project that needs databases, JDBC connectors, and Data serialization?)  Similarly with Spring....  

That being said, I got into my job now due to having a fair amount of Java experience and I've spent the time in my current role learning Asynchronous Javascript / JS promises (bluebird) which is a FUCKING NIGHTMARE by comparison.   I miss my executorService / ThreadPool so much....
";;
Because good Java developers are ridiculously hard to find.  And while everyone likes to claim that Java is dying, it's actually growing faster than most.;;
If you look at the 'big data' (you might think it's a fad or a hype but it most certainly is not) ecosystem Java is completely dominant there. Companies like Google, Netflix and Facebook produce tons of Java OS.;;
"We'll fuck.

">As someone who came in first in their uni Java development course (and highest ever score of 97%)....... I took a massive tumble by jumping into the VB.Net pool of death.
  
  First off, one course does not dictate how well you will do with Java in industry. Second, with VB.Net why not just transition to C#? The syntax is different but the .NET framework is the same. ";;
"Two reasons:

1. There's an awful lot of Java out there. Java became one of the major options for 'enterprise software', meaning there are a lot of very large legacy codebases that mostly do their jobs and do not need to be replaced, but do of course need to be maintained.  Its ascendancy was simultaneous with the hype peak for object-oriented programming, and so it benefited enormously from that. (Many of the classic OO books - Clean Code, Refactoring, GOOS - are written with Java examples.)

2. While the JVM used to have a reputation for being dog-slow, that is no longer the case. Once it's running, Java software zips along nicely nowadays, especially if you know how to tune the JVM. This has also had the effect of making the JVM a more attractive target for new languages, notably Scala and today's hipster favourite, Clojure. Good knowledge of Java-the-language is helpful for using other JVM languages, if only because of library interop.

None of this is to pass judgment on Java *as a language* either which way. It benefits from a pretty simple design at the language core and largely predictable behaviour, and thus is fairly easy to pick up; it suffers from the infamous plague of boilerplate; choices around the implementation of generic types, etc, remain controversial. 

There are certainly worse fates than writing Java, however, and much of the abuse it gets nowadays is directed less at the language itself as what it came to symbolise for the programming generation before ours (enterprise hell, dictatorial architects, big design up front, etc). ";;
"The easy answer is that it is popular. Some of the reason why it got popular are:

Java makes it harder to shoot yourself in the foot.

It has a lot of useful libraries. 

It was one of the first object oriented programming language that caught on.";;
As a student about to start my career, it is also the predominant language taught in both high school and university. ;;
That doesn't explain why employers would want Java though. At most, it shows schools responding to demand.;;
I dunno, I see an increasing number of schools moving from Java, personally.  C++ and Python are popular CS101 classes, and I've even seen a few teach Scheme, or some variant thereof.  In fact, my University only offered a single Java class, now that I think about it, and it was more about OOP design that it was about Java.;;
The reason many schools use it is because it's popular in the industry, not the other way around. Back when I started in 1998 they had just switched from C++ to Java a year back because it was already taking off.;;
The reason it is taught in high school, at least in the US, is because the AP Board switched from C++ to Java around 2002. When I took AP Programming in high school we used C++ but I remember our teaching having to take classes to learn Java so he could be ready for the switch. ;;
One thing that has been mentioned is that there is a lot of existing code base in Java so employers need developers who know Java to work on that. One thing that I'll add is some big name software uses Java so interfacing with that is much easier in Java. I know IBM Cognos has an SDK in Java and so does SAP. Having to interface with many different enterprise software makes knowing Java important.;;
"It's the network effect. Almost everybody knows Java, so if you want to hire a programmer, you'll get the widest hiring pool if you ask for people who know Java.

More technically speaking, while Java is sort of uninspiring, it's reliable, robust, reasonably efficient, and has a strong ecosystem. All of these factors makes Java a ""default choice"" of sorts, especially for larger/enterprise companies.";;
what everybody else said, plus java is compatible with a lot more things than many other languages.;;
"Well here in Aachen Germany, many people just know java. The universities teach Java, many companies use Java. Companies like to keep changes minimal and have all changes as fast and easy as possible. If the programs are written in Java and everone knows Java, lets hire Java developers ;-)
(I know i know there is a lot of other languages too here^^)";;
Another reason: Code written in Java is usually quite verbose. Verbosity means there is more code to maintain. More code to maintain means more programmers needed who can work with Java. Code written in Java is usually quite verbose.;;
Java isn't any more verbose than most other languages and just because python doesn't use braces and variable types doesn't mean you need only half the developers. Have you ever tried Java?;;
"I wasn't so much referring to the syntactic overhead of Java, but more to the semantic overhead. Not so much to the numerous keywords and braces, but more to the proliferation of unnecessary or unsavoury objects (main objects, AbstractFactoryFactorys, Singletons, etc.).

As for Python, I think it's a nice language, but it's not part of my toolbox. I prefer to have types and braces. Types are a good way to do some static sanity checking. Braces help me quickly reason about control flow and scope.

Anyway, I suppose what I'm saying is that I don't care for the philosophy and culture that surrounds Java. I believe that the Java culture encourages monolithic codebases that require a lot of effort to maintain.
";;
You need 1 programmer for every 20 lines of code in your codebase. Given that java has 10 out of every 20 lines of code as a { or }, Java is not as efficient as python. QED.;;
"Source? Because it doesn't work like that.

- 20 lines per programmer per day, per hour, per program? So 10'000 line program needs 500 programmers? 

- In what language? There are languages that are really hard to write because they are old and bad.

- What kind of code? Writing 20 lines of some easy code takes 5 minutes. If you have to fix a bug, reform code or optimise an algorithm it can take whole day ...and your line count may be negative!

Writing

    if(x < 4 && x > 2)
    {
       x = 3; 
    }

isn't any slower to write and neither is it any harder to read than:

    if x < 4 and x > 2:
        x = 3

The difference is in fact 1 button press. It just takes 4 lines instead of 2. Why do you think pressing that 1 button makes it take twice the time?

coding isn't even about typing speed! Most of the time is spent thinking and debugging. Even if it took 1 second less to write an if-statement it wouldn't make any difference. The 1 second you save in an if statement is refunded when you start debugging Java as it is very easy to understand and debug compared to debugging python.";;

Depends on your bracing style bro;;
"There are ports called 'ephemeral' ports, they're temporary and either assigned randomly or they're given out in sequence depending on the OS and how it is configured. The range of ephemeral ports also ranges depending on the OS, but it's usually above 30,000 up to the maximum of 65,535. 

The web server you're connecting to is the one that's listening on port 80. That's because clients such as your browser need to absolutely know what port to connect to. These ports are called well-known ports because they have services assigned to them--80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, 22 for SSH, 110 for POP3, etc. 

So the way it works is that your browser will get an ephemeral port when it wants to initiate a network connection. Then whenever it wants to connect to a server somewhere, it will send its ephemeral port number to the other server so that the server knows where to send back the data that the browser requested. ";;
"Port 80 is bound on the HTTP *server* side.  This is standardized so that your browser knows how to reach the webserver without having to guess what port it might be using.

Since your browser is initiating the connection to the webserver, it can pick any available port to use (from a range of usable ports), that port is sent along with the connection data and the server will remember that when sending the response back.";;
"Browsers do not ""bind"" or listen on port 80, servers do.

"If you really dislike programming, I would reconsider your career path. Too many people are all of a sudden looking getting into programming just for the money. 

I'm sure a good chunk of them are going to pretty much be miserable for the rest of their careers as programmers because they chose to get into it just for cash. Also, these types of programmers tend to be shitty programmers since they don't actually have motivation to learn new things, just doing the bare minimum to keep their jobs or w/e.

I'm not saying you have to decide now. However, just don't get tied into feeling you have to get into something because it pays well, especially programming.

>study Math [...] or is it better for them to focus their time programming

Depends on what you want to do, if you're going into web development math isn't too useful. If you want to work on high performance database systems math is very important I would think.

> reading important CS/programming books like SICP?

There is some merit to reading books like that, but at some point if you choose the programming side it's better to get your hands dirty and make things. If you decide to go into research/academia though reading books like that could be very helpful (maybe not that book, but something like Knuth's The Art of Computer Programming)";;
"If you want a CS career but enjoy math, you can still get the best of both worlds because most of CS is rooted in mathematics. You will use plenty linear algebra, discrete math, statistics, and maybe calculus depending on what you specialize in. 

For example you can do a CS education with a focus on scientific and numerical computing.

Also not sure what you mean by skills becoming obsolete in the tech field. What are the definition of a tech skills vs. math skill or problem solving skills?

If by tech skill you mean knowing how to program in a specific language, then true some day a popular language like Java will be obsolete like Fortran. But your skill as a engineer are not bound to the language or a particular tool. Java is one implementation of your knowledge in algorithms, data structures, numerical methods, design patterns, etc. When the next popular language pops up and the current one is no longer in favor, it's not like there is going to be a radical new set of knowledge that we never seen before.";;
I shouldn't be here, but why not both?;;
"Time constraints.

"Pretty much. 

Then when you create a new, optimised, compiler you compile it with the old compiler, which results in a new but still slow compiler that doesn't have any of the optimisations that it provides, so you use that newly compiled compiler to compile it's own source code so it has all those optimisations giving you a fast version of the new compiler.

Writing a compiler for a toy language is quite interesting and definitely a learning experience.";;
Neat, thanks!;;
"> Is it simply a matter of writing the compiler in another language first

Yes. The first C compiler was actually written in a language call [BCPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCPL), which was itself originally written in assembly. From there on, C itself was used to create a large number of other compilers, like C++ (obviously).";;

Cool, thanks!;;
Yeah, you got it.  No language can be compiled before there is a compiler, natch, so the first compiler needs to be in a different language.  Then, at some point, you can write a compiler in the native language, compile this compiler, and then change to using that.  This happens in most all languages AFAIK.;;
"Assembler can be ""compiled"" without compiler or am i missing something ?";;
Assembly language is turned into machine code by an 'assembler', but because assembly basically directly maps to machine code, it can be assembled into machine code quite easily by hand. Because of this the first assembler ever made was likely written out on paper, then translated by hand to the equivalent machine code. From there you could code a second, improved assembler, and have the first assembler translate it to machine code for you.;;
"I don't think you're missing anything. Compilers either do all the work of compilation, or eventually pass it off to another compiler (in that compiler's language) to complete the process. A self-hosting compiler can't defy causality, so it must be written in another language and built using another compiler first. Otherwise, who could compile it?

To simplify the process, you can allow overlap between your hosting compiler's language and your own. This will simplify the transition to self-hosting, but the transition cannot happen without some sort of intermediary (even if that intermediary is you, manually writing it in assembly).";;
"I would advise against Javascript to start with, that language has some rather odd behaviors. Python is a nice language, but between it and Java I'd say the differences for learning as a first language are small.

"Fundamentally, ""hacky"" code is code that accomplishes some goal by compromising on some principle that people would much rather not compromise on. For example, we might call a program hacky if...

1. It does not follow good style
2. It's grossly inefficient
3. It follows a really awkward design/the flow of logic barely makes sense. 
4. The code digs into the internals of some other library/does not respect the contractual interface of the other library
5. The code is brittle and fragile (not robust to external change)
6. etc...

Usually, hacky code arises when people are either rushed for time (and so _must_ compromise on something in order to get the job done), or didn't know what they were doing and either didn't know that they were violating some principle, or weren't experienced enough to care.

Or more generally speaking, the term ""hack"" will refer to a quick job that does what's needed, but poorly. Consequently, code stops being hacky when it no longer violates these principles of good style and design. 

Somewhat confusingly, calling something ""hacky"" can also be a sort of compliment, based on context. If you're rushing, and barely manage to get something working against all odds, people might call it a ""hack"" in a sort of admiring/how-the-fuck-did-you-get-that-working tone of voice. 

Even more confusingly, the term ""hack"" can sometimes also mean to either ""explore"" or ""playfully experiment with"". The idea is that if you're exploring/experimenting, you're unlikely to write code that follows all the principles of good style because you're liable to throw the code away very soon, and eventually the term ""hacking"" became in a sense synonymous with the term ""exploring"". 

(And we circle back around -- if people start actually using that exploratory codeobody bothers to fix it, then you're basically stuck with a hacky codebase and now everybody's miserable).

However, while I can spout definitions, I think the best way to get an intuitive feel for what counts as a hack is to actually instead learn what counts as good code (if you're interested, there are many books that teach the principles of good style -- for example, see [Code Complete](http://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670)).

Once you understand what good code should look like, it'll be much easier to spot hacky code -- you feel a sort of instinctual revulsion towards it (or sometimes a fascinated revulsion).

I'd consider hacky code to be difficult to read and understand, or code that works but isn't a viable solution long-term (performs badly, doesn't provide full functionality).;;
So hastily thrown together or unclear (but functional)?;;
I think that most people here are talking about basically shitty code. Hacky code in my opinion is code that interacts with other code in ways not originally intended by the creators of said other code.;;
Yup.;;
Bare in mind, sometimes hacky code is the only way to achieve a solution at present.;;
"When, instead of finding the root of the problem, you apply a sketchy fix to ""just make it work""

Trivial example:

Buggy program:

    int doubleInt(int val)
    {
        int retVal = val * 3;
        return retVal;
    }

Clean fix:

    int doubleInt(int val)
    {
        int retVal = val * 2; //fixed incorrect constant
        return retVal;
    }

Hacky fix:

    int doubleInt(int val)
    {
        int retVal = val * 3;
        //fix to issue where numbers would be
        //tripled instead of doubled
        float retVal_float = (float)retVal;
        retVal_float /= 1.5f;
        return (int)retVal_float;
    }

Other examples of hacks include magic numbers, magic if statements, magic disappearance of if statements, calling the same function 4 times when it's obvious that you should only call it once, etc. 

Things like these essentially make your code an unreadable pile of shit and it will inevitably collapse under the weight of its' own shittiness at some point in time, as every new fix will require you to ""go along"" with your previous kludge fixes";;
"Real world example:

**Problem:** Double database hit on transaction causes increased latency, occasionally spiking high enough to cause a timeout on the client side.

**Hacky fix:** Cache result of second database query using simple hash map. Most transactions no longer require a second query.

**Real fix:** Modify workflow to eliminate need for second query. Failing that, create an application-wide caching layer to avoid the need to rewrite this hash map hack everywhere else the problem surfaces.";;
"Any ""hack"" is a workaround to a problem typically solved with a sub-optimal solution (does not scale, fragile, etc.).  This can be ok if you're limited by time or the tools you're able to work with since it may turn out to be the only solution.  All hacks leave some form of technical debt behind. ";;
">All hacks leave some form of technical debt behind. 

I feel this is the most important part. Hacks eventually need to get revisited, either to be fixed, or rewritten completely 
";;
I consider hacky code, code that is put together quickly that does complete a task, but not in the most thought out way, or the most efficient. Hacky code is generally your first attempt and if it seems to work, then screw quality, it's good to go.;;
So a hacky solution to you is more of a prototype?;;
Not necessarily. I've written code that worked, but in a way that isn't perfect. For instance we had some code that would iterative through a list of items, one happened to be the name of the application. I decided to just grab that for another function instead of actually getting the application name properly. The hacky bit is I'm wasn't even sure if that name would be there 100% of the time, nor if it not being there would break the program. Since it's worked 100% of the time for now I don't really care, it's hacky in that it's not the best way to do it, I'm not even 100% if it worked, but it *looked* like it did, so we've kept it.;;
Simply: Would you be embarrassed when your co-workers find out this is the solution you've chosen?;;
"The abstract equivalent of patching a broken piece up with duct tape.


In general, it is good code if its easily readable and maintainable, and works. Hacky code probably only works to a bare minimum.";;
"I came up with [this snippit](http://codepad.org/BSUdGDt2) a while ago and its pretty bad.

this would be good code if it was commented and used ntohs();

I consider this bit hacky because it uses the address of something in the stack, which is generally just about the worst thing you can do as far as bugs go.

So i guess hacky code is code in a style that is bug prone.";;
Code that works, right now, but isn't exactly engineered to be the best solution.;;
"In python, variables referencing lists are pointers. Hence, in #2, when you change b, you change all other instances where you have an association to b (ie, lst[0] here, is a pointer to the same object as pointed to by b). You can see this by:

    a = [1, 2, 3]
    b = a
    id(a) == id(b)

This will return true, which means, both are pointing to the same object.

In #3, you have change where b is pointing to. b, now points to a new object, but that does not mean ['foo', 'bar'] has disappeared, because it is still being pointed to by lst[0]. Think of it as two name tags on the same memory location, you remove one (b), but the other (lst[0]) still remains.

In #4, you have created an infinite cyclic list, ie, an element of the list, points to itself. This is possible, because, like I said, list assignments are pointers.

FYI, similar properties also hold true for dicts in python.

Hope that helped!

Edit: Formating.";;
"So my reasoning ""is that in number two, b is being edited, while in number three, b is being reassigned which causes it to not affect lst. Also, how can editing b change lst? Is it because b is equal to a part of lst and by editing b, it will edit all instances of b?"" is correct right?";;
"Yeah, seems to be. Until #3, `b` and `lst[0]` point to the same list, so you could use them interchangably to refer to that otherwise-unnamed list that starts with 'foo'.

In #3 you point `b` at a new list, but `lst[0]` still points to the 'foo' list, which then has nothing to do with `b`.";;
[Check this out](http://foobarnbaz.com/2012/07/08/understanding-python-variables/), it doesn't apply to only numbers, it applies to everything in Python.;;
I think I otherwise understand what you are saying. Thanks a lot!;;
"I'm not a python lady, so my terminology might be a little off. But think of variables as referring to python objects. 

A variable is ""just"" a label, and can be changed to refer to different objects over time. Similarly multiple variables might refer to the same object.

1. In #1 `lst[0]` is a variable which refers to the same list object that the variable `b` refers to.

2. In #2 this underlying list object is modified, so this modification shows up both places.

3. In #3 `b` stops referring to the earlier list object, and is re-seated to refer to a different object. The original object never got modified, so `lst` stays untouched.

4. In #4 the variable `lst[0]` refers to `lst`, but this means that `lst[0][0]` refers to `lst` too (uh oh...) so Python can't pretty print the entire thing (it would be infinitely long). 
";;
"`lst[0] = b` puts (edit: a reference to) the list pointed to by `b` in the first item of the list pointed to by `lst`

Until you reassign `b` in #3, by pointing it to a new list, `lst[0]` and `b` are basically pointing to the same list. That's why in #2 when you set `b[1]` to 'ply', it's the same as setting `lst[0][1]` to 'ply', because `b` and `lst[0]` in that context [are the same].

Changing what `b` [points to] doesn't change the list in `lst[0]`

Someone might be able to explain the internals of this better and maybe I'm not using the right names or technicalities for this stuff, but I tried it out in a shell and that's what seems to be happening.

Similarly for #4, you're pointing the first element of `lst` back to `lst` itself; python prints the `[...]` instead of recursively accessing the list. You can do that by:

    lst
    lst[0]
    lst[0][0]
    lst[0][0][0]

... etc. Those all point to `lst` (edit: I should have said, those all point to the same list)

You could even do this:

    >>> c = lst
    >>> lst
    [[...], 2, 3, 4]
    >>> c
    [[...], 2, 3, 4]
    >>> lst = []
    >>> lst
    []
    >>> c
    [[...], 2, 3, 4]

the list formerly known as `lst` still exists, but it stops being referred to by `lst` and is only pointed to by `c` (and `c[0], c[0][0]` etc) 

    >>> c[0][0][1]
    2";;
"Thank you! I think I get it now.

By that same logic, if I do...

> x = 4
> y = x
> x = 3
> x

x will return 3 because before I reassigned x to 3, y and x both pointed to the same thing: 4. Now, since I changed the meaning of x *completely* to 4 (i.e. I did not edit the 3 in some sense), y does not change as well. ";;

Browsing through it:

Certainly an interesting concept. 

Chapter 3 and 4 use C arrays^1 ,   `qsort` and raw pointer allocation, which leaves a sour taste. 

Nonetheless, I like what the author *does* with these things: e.g. for those ugly evil arrays, he exercises the fundamental operations such as copying, searching and sorting. Then, builds upon these operations to solve more complex problems. 

Focus is on *constructing* a solution, identifying problems etc. From the short read I can't tell about the quality of the solutions,  but the problems themselves make sense. They, as well as as the exercises, seem well selected to *train* your toolset.

Still, it seems not very valuable for an experienced programmer. 

If you already ""get"" programming, it's no more than a collection of nice exercises. 

It is aimed at those who fail to make the mental leap, who have ""coders block"", who can convert an algorithm into code, but are stumped at coming up with the algorithm in the first place. 

$20 for the e-book may seem steep - but as usual the bigger question is: are you willing to invest at least a few dozen hours into reading and solving the exercises? It's nothing you read to get enlightened. You have to do.

"All I can say is that it wouldn't be all that easy to automate. Probably not worth it for something that happens once a year ([relevant](https://xkcd.com/1205/)).

The issue is that working with programs like excel and powerpoint is non-trivial. I've never done it myself, so can't say exactly how long it would take, but probably much more time than it would take to do this manually.

Although it's entirely possible. You'd want to start with VBA and lookup how to interact with excel and to create a chart. Then examine your data and figure out how to programmatically create these charts (exactly how will depend on what the data and charts are). Then you'd figure out how to interact with powerpoint and to insert these charts into the appropriate powerpoint slides.

Start somewhere like [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/office/ee814737(v=office.14\).aspx) (depending on the version of Office you use).

It may be worthwhile to automate only part of the project (I can't say for sure as I'm not familiar with VBA). Eg, you might automate just the creation of chart images from the excel file, then you'd manually insert them into the powerpoint (which would only take a minute if there's about 10 slides).";;

Now how much of that time is wasted because the person is a bit lazy I don't know but I do know that it seems definitely worthwhile from my point of view to at least give it a go. Thanks for the links. The other commenter recommended VBA too and I thought that might be the solution so I guess I'll just get down to trying to learn that;;
"What form are the responses in? Do they fill it out online, via email, or on paper? That makes a huge difference.

Have you considered using something like Google Forms (part of Google Docs & Drive) to collect the data? It automatically stores the results in a spreadsheet that you can download and open with Excel.

If the data needs to be tabulated, that's the most straightforward case for writing a program.

I'd suggest signing up for code wars, if only to try some of the exercises based around basic language features. It supports quite a few languages, too.;;
Aw, no C++ yet.;;
"You can usually expand on whatever exercises are provided.

For example, suppose that they provide an exercise:

>Write code that uses a loop to print the following shape:

>     *
>     **
>     ***
>     ****

Now, can you expand on this to make code that prints out:

     *
     **
     ***
     ****
     ***
     **
     *

By using some creativity, you can slightly modify exercises and examples to create new ones. You can do this with most kinds of exercises.

Here's some more ideas off the top of my head specifically for loops, for example:

1. Take in an integer, n. Now print out that integer n times. Eg, if the input was ""3"", you'd print out ""333"". If you haven't learned how to get user input yet, you can hardcode the integer. Assuming JS, you can use [`confirm`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/confirm) to get simple input.
2. Given a string, print out all the characters on their own line. Eg, if the string is ""hello"", you'd print out:

        h
        e
        l
        l
        o

    Assuming JS, you can use [`charAt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt) to get the character at a given index and [`length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length) to get the length of the string (so you know what to loop to).
3. Reverse a string. Also try to reverse an array (for this, reverse the array without creating a new one).

I find myself not limited by how fast I can type but how fast my brain processes logic.;;
I'm looking to balance them, at the moment I feel I type too slow and look at the keyboard a lot.;;
"Well, if you can't touch type, then typing speed will be an issue. I find that for the most part, I have to spend quite a bit of time thinking and not typing. But I also do have times when I know exactly what I want and merely have to type it. Touch typing is really useful (along with learning IDE tricks such as how to use auto-complete). In fact, I hate writing code because writing is so slow compared to typing.

I can't really recommend anything, though, since I learned through odd methods. In elementary school, there was this program called ""Paws"" that we used. Teachers would actually mark us for our typing and we had to reach certain typing speeds in order to be allowed to play games. They'd cover up the keyboard so that we had to touch type.

But that wasn't the only source of my learning. I also played WAY too much RuneScape as a kid. I mostly played for the community, so got a lot of practice in typing things quickly (since being too slow to type meant you couldn't chat effectively and were slowed down in whatever else you were doing).

I've heard good things of Mavis Beacon programs, but honestly, it's something you don't need a program for. It's all about practice. Put your fingers over the right keys, don't look at the keyboards, and type stuff (eg, copy a page from a book). It'll be very slow at first. You may have some times when you'll have to look for a key and that's alright. Just keep practicing and it gets faster and easier. You'll eventually start memorizing the key locations and everything just ""clicks"".";;
"RuneScape is the only reason I can type more than 30 WPM.

No better drill than typing`@ran trading red mask + 100k for blue` over and over and over . . .";;
What is your touch typing speed and what is your hunt n peck speed?;;
"I can type 130 WPM+ and let me tell you: That speed doesn't really help me a lot when coding. As long as you're not looking 10 seconds for every single character, the speed of typing usually won't limit your coding speed.

If you want to code faster, then learn how to use your IDE efficiently. There are a lot of shortcuts, code completions and templates you can use to make work a lot faster. Also try to use your keyboard as much as possible and your mouse as less as possible.

If you still just want to learn to type, then find yourself a ten finger system tutorial and practice, something like this:

http://www.typingtutor-online.com/

It's actually not that hard, learn where your fingers have to stay, learn which finger has to press which button (which is pretty obvious if you know how to lay your fingers on the keyboard) and then practice... practice... practice. Just write everything you write correctly and with some time you will type a lot faster.";;
Take a look [typing.io](https://www.typing.io/).  Claims to help programmers learn to type. ;;
Isn't this kinda unnecessary? I mean, most of the time after you create the initial variable name you can just use tab to autocomplete. This saves a lot of time in avoiding spelling issues prior to compilation. ;;
"Typing is typing whether you're hitting tab or filling out the entire name.  You also have all the numbers and special symbols to deal with.   And some of us don't use autocomplete.  I find it derails my train of thought.  That said, my train is an old steam engine so there's that.      

Touch typing is still a good skill for a programmer to have.  I've probably entered more text creating specifications and other documentation than code over the years.   ";;
If you can touch type, don't worry about the typing speed. If you can't, learn it with a program or website made for that purpose. Learning VIM might make you a bit faster at editing text files. Otherwise, the mechanics of typing are not the limiting factor. ;;
Programming is not continuously typing for extended periods of time. Learn to touch type if you don't already, and learn to type faster with practice, but doubling your typing speed will not double your programming speed.;;
"If you can't touch type then it just takes practice.  It's really just about repetition.  If you haven't taken a typing class, either in person or virtually, then look into it.

If you can touch type then your typing speed shouldn't be an issue.";;
You are all wrong, play Qwerty Warriors, you can add your own words and choose difficulty, it's a fun game on the Web that teaches typing;;
The language alone does not determine the quality of the courses/curriculum, and a CS degree is not about learning any specific languages.;;
Because they teach Fortran ? You can make alot maintaining fortran and cobol programming since the older programmers are retiring and its still used . From the 3rd link they also cover C and C++ which is still used . It also looks like they do teach you multiple languages which is a good thing . It will teach you how to think and develop a program not how to just use a specific language .;;
COBOL experience is a great way to demand whatever amount of money you want.  ;;
My Dad did Fortan and Cobol programming for close to 30 years before he retired and he still gets some calls offering him alot of money to work on some older program that no one can work on anymore . Younger people dont really learn those languages and the majority of people who do know them are retired or close to retirement . So they may be old outdated languages but there are still alot of companies that rely on programs written in those languages .;;
"Yes, however the problem is that a young person learning cobol or fortran probably won't get offers. That's because these companies don't just want knowledge of the language, they want expertise and experience.

Any of the devs on my team can learn fortran or cobol, they are smart and get stuff done. However, if I have a production legacy application that needs a lot of work, what I'm really looking for is experience. Someone that not only knows those languages, but knows the gotchas, knows how deployment works and can be successful.
";;
That is  true , I am not a developer but I have seen and received quite a few job offers for fortran and cobol somehow  .[And there was this article last year](http://www.bloomberg.com/bw/articles/2014-06-25/the-talent-that-keeps-your-50-year-old-software-running-is-retiring-dot-now-what) . But your right about the gotchas for older languages .;;
I was in a grad program for astrophysics for a bit.  Lots of stuff there is still written in Fortran, even new stuff.  Some people are switching over to Python, but not all.;;
"When I first started taking CS courses, Pascal was the starter language that people were using before we went into C++. 

Programming is programming. The languages change, the syntax changes, the features change, but programming is still programming. If you take the time to ace all those courses, you should be comfortable stepping into the managed code platforms that all the hot shot kids are using these days. ";;
"After flipping through the syllabuses, it seems like the curriculum you're taking _is_ heavily geared/focused towards scientific computing/low-level computing in general, and doesn't really seem to branch out into other domains/fully explore CS theory (unless there are additional electives you can take). 

For example, there doesn't appear to be any discrete math courses, there's only a single course on data structures and algorithms, there doesn't seem to be any courses related to building websites, there are no courses on functional programming, no compilers class, etc...

That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but _is_ something to keep in mind. If you want a general CS education, you may want to carefully evaluate if this is the right place for you. In contrast, if you _are_ interested in scientific and mathematical computing and/or with low-level computing (working with electronics, logic gates, etc), this may be a good course to take.

I would also definitely talk to the advisors for that school -- they're going to be know a whole bunch more about their curriculum compared to random strangers on the internet. We can give you our best guess, but you can already see that you're getting a wide variety of responses ranging from ""programming isn't about the languages + don't worry about obsolescence"" to the more negative ""this seems too minimal"", which means that our collective opinion probably isn't worth much. ";;
"In my experience advisers know less than nothing. They think they know a thing, but it's wrong. And if you listen to it, it will bite you in the ass.


/bitter";;
Are these all the subjects they're teaching?  This looks woefully lacking in terms of courses, even if you assume they're taught well.  If it's just the first year then it's okay.;;
For all you know, they could be teaching the latest version of Fortran. Also, Fortran is a beautiful language for massively parallel data processing.;;
">Also, Fortran is a beautiful language for massively parallel data processing.

Really? I'll have to look into it some more then, I've never heard that (not that I've looked much into fortran at all).";;
Yeah, it's even had OO support since 2003';;
Cool! Apparently it's really not the ancient, useless beast I thought it was.;;
Wtf is in your fourth link?  Generally I wouldn't be worried about the school's reputation, as long as you learn interesting stuff, but maybe that's just me.;;
"A CS course can't really be ""outdated"".  All the new stuff is based on top of the old, and if you have your concepts right, you should be fine and able to learn everything you need.

That's my understanding of the situation, anyways.  But I am very much not a person who you should trust on that.";;
Hi, I am not too familiar with this site, but I will try to help. I think the first step would be getting IDs of all professors from certain school from its profile. After you store all of their IDs, you generate URLs for each individual ID and scrape it from there. Hope this helps :);;
"That's the problem that I'm having, all of the ids seem to be randomly generated, there isn't a way for me to know what each professor's Id is going to be without visiting each page individually and logging the url.

Doing this manually would defeat the purpose of a web crawler/scraping program.";;
"You mention that you can visit the pages manually to find the professors IDs. Can you figure out how to automate that? What do the professors have in common? Is there a page listing all professors?

Most web scrapers are multi-part. You'll do something like scrape one page to get data for the next scrape.";;
"Multi part, gotcha. So I need to scrape the id's from the professors pages before I can gather the data I'm after. As pointed out in a previous comment, there is a page that lists all professors (there's like 6,000), but it only shows you 20 at a time unless you press a button that allows you to load 20 more.

How would you suggest I automate this? I found a thread from a previous redditor attempting something similar, but I'm having trouble recreating their solution. It doesn't look like the network request is JSON anymore. Idk what that means.";;
"Do you actually need all 6k? You can't narrow it down by department or a search query?

If you need them all, you'll just have to go through those pages of 20. Since it's automated, this is kind of doable. Could also dig through the page's source to figure out what it sends to the server to get a more minimal JSON (etc) response. This requires experience with JS and front end web dev, though.";;
"Okay so I've dug through the network and found this jQuery.


http://pastebin.com/kci4fRvt


So it seems to me that what I need to do is set up a loop to scrape 20 professors, send a request to the server to load 20 more, then scrape 20, request 20, scrape 20 etc. But I'm not finding anything in the documentation telling me how to do this.

Suggestions?";;
"It's not going to be documented. That's why scraping can be tricky. You have to deal with the fact the page wasn't designed for what you're doing. This is their private API, so no documentation for you.

Depending on the URL that was used to get the linked page, you may be able to figure out how to structure the next URL. Eg, if the URL was `http://example.com/get_professors?school=MIT&offset=120`, then you might assume that the next URL would be something like `http://example.com/get_professors?school=MIT&offset=140`.

Based on some *really* quick inspections of your URL (I don't care enough to invest more time, sorry), I found this URL:

    http://search.mtvnservices.com/typeahead/suggest/?q=*%3A*+AND+schoolid_s%3A45&defType=edismax&siteName=rmp&rows=20&start=20

I note that it has a `start` and `rows` (and you can modify `rows` to get more results). I found this URL by inspecting the browser's requests in the network tab of dev tools, then removing parameters that might be optional so that I could get a minimal URL.

You could try and play around with that to get the results you want. Get a JSON parser like GSON to parse this data.

Note: when making requests, use timeouts (eg, 2 seconds between requests) so as to avoid being easily detected as a bot (which could get you IP banned). Also consider randomizing the user agent to avoid detection.";;
Thank you very much, I think you've put me on to something here. Hopefully with some more work I'll be able to solve this and extract the data I need.;;
If you look at the profile of the school (http://www.ratemyprofessors.com/campusRatings.jsp?sid=45), you can see list of all the professors on the left side of the page. IDs of these professors stay the same so I would try to scrape URLs of each individual professor at the school from this page. After that you can use these IDs to automaticaly scrape rating pages of each professor.;;
"Definitely, I see that the professors are listed along the left side of the page. The only issue that I find with that is that I have to click ""Load More"" to generate 20 more professors.

I found a link to a previous reddit thread of someone getting having a similar problem, and the solution had something to do with making a JSON request?

I don't know what that is, but I've tried to follow what the solution was on that thread. I'll link to it now.

Any idea what I do now?

https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2ti9t7/help_with_web_scraping/

EDIT: Would like to mention that when I view the ""Networking"" tab in firebug, the type does not match the screenshot of the previous reddit post. In the previous post it says it's JSON, now it says that it's HTML. Idk if that helps at all. I don't understand what I'm trying to do with the network. I'm assuming there's a way to automate requests to the server to generate more results?";;
"Why are you using an ArrayList? Use a HashMap with ID as key and item as your value.

http://examples.javacodegeeks.com/java-basics/data-types/java-dictionary-example/

edit: Changed to HashMap with better Example.";;
I think it's for an assignment, but OP didn't specify what they are or are not allowed to use. ;;
"First of all, never use `ArrayList` without generics. So your `idArray` should be an `ArrayList<Integer>` (by the way, get in the habit of calling it `idList`, because arrays are very different things).

It's not clear why the heck `counter` exists. Or why `newId` is initialized to 1 and then counter is incremented (but not used). This may imply some kind of misunderstanding and you should think about what you need them for (if anything).

The first thing that I note is that you're indexing everything with a sequential number. Why? Lists already maintain order, so the index in the list (which you'd access with `get(int)`) is the unique number. So having a separate serial number is redundant.

Perhaps you actually wanted to take this unique ID as input? Eg, you'd then have `addItem(int id, T item)`? In such a case, your approach of having two arrays would work. But it'd be much easier to have a single array and use a container class that stores both the ID and the value. Something like:

    private class Node<T> {
        T item;
        int id;
    }

And that's what you'd store in the `ArrayList`.

Anyway, problem with your `addItem` method is that the ID never changes but presumably is supposed to. The ID will always be 1.

The problem with `removeItem` is that you don't know what the ID of the item to remove is and at no point of time do you figure that out. Right now you're just taking some weird field and hoping that it works. That's not going to work. Programs are dumb, remember? They can't read minds and you must tell them exactly what to do.

So to summarize, you should:

1. Figure out if you're actually supposed to be using a sequential integer ID that is entirely internal. Because that makes no sense. You probably are supposed to pass the ID into the add/remove functions (and then you'd use the ID to find the item). Look up the dictionary ADT, since you're basically implementing a dictionary.
2. Consider changing to having a class that groups the item and ID together as shown above. This will be easier to work with than having two lists.
3. Fix your add/remove functions to use the right IDs. Note that this will depend heavily on #1.
4. Learn how to use a debugger (all IDEs should have one) so that you can inspect objects yourself and thus be able to detect issues like the IDs all being 1.

EDIT: As an aside, what you called ""getters and setters"" in your code aren't getters or setters at all. It's highly beneficial to use the right terminology, otherwise you'll confuse yourself and others. Those are just regular methods. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutator_method#Java_example) for what getters and setters are and why they're used.";;
"Hey man thanks for the reply
I realized I've got the wrong idea about it and found out the right solution.

Anyways I'm working on a generics [Assignment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3c9kw6/java_i_need_help_with_jumpstarting_my_assignment/) and now I'm stuck on number 3.

    	protected final long orderId = counter++;
    	//Add, Remove, and OrderId
    	public void addItem(T item){
    		orderItems.add(item);
    	}
    	
    	public void remItem(T item){
    		orderItems.remove(item);
    	}
    	
    	public long getOrderId(){
    		return orderId;
    	}
    	
    	public String toString(){
    		String result = ""OrderId:"" + getOrderId() + ""\n"";
    		result += ""OrderList:\n"";
    		for(T item : orderItems)
    			result += ""\tItem: "" + item.getClass().getCanonicalName() +""\n"";
    		return result;
    	}
    	
    	public static void main(String[] args){
    		//Testing
    		GenericOrder<Product> test = new GenericOrder<Product>();
    		ComputerPart part1 = new ComputerPart(26);
    		test.addItem(part1);
    		
    		System.out.println(test.toString());
    		
    		GenericOrder<Product> newTest = new GenericOrder<Product>();
    		ComputerPart newPart = new ComputerPart(69);
    		newTest.addItem(newPart);
    		
    		System.out.println(newTest.toString());
    	}
    }

and for #3 How do i make it so that the ComputerOrder only takes in ComputerPart, Peripheral, and Service?

I think it has to do with something like

    public class ComputerOrder<T extends ComputerPart> extends GenericOrder<T>{
        //stuff
        }

but i'm trying to make a generic method but idk how to go on about it.

Then on the server, you'd access the form (google for how to receive a form in PHP, then how to upload files). It's VERY IMPORTANT you lookup and carefully sanitize user input. There is no way to be sure that a message came from your program and not some malicious user who might send bad data. The user can never be trusted.

It doesn't matter much. Styles for different languages tend to be based on what the original developers for those languages preferred, and in general that's what you should go along with, for specific languages.;;
Thanks! I'm not really a programmer by training, and I'm just starting to write code that other people will use, so I thought it best to check whether I should conform to different standards for different languages or just have a common style for my entire project (which uses both R and python for legacy reasons);;
Although syntax might tractor into it slightly, I'd be more hesitant to use a two space indent in python where there's no { } like in C style syntax;;

";;
I was using it as an example. To use another, I'd rather indent things in an SQL query by more than two spaces for the same reason.;;
"But SQL doesn't really have traditional blocks. There's pretty much no generally accepted consistent way to indent SQL.

Languages like HTML are more interesting. The indentation matters a lot for HTML. However, there can very easily be a lot of indentation (and that's not a sign of the HTML being bad). I use 2 space indentation for HTML (and all SGML languages) to avoid having my screen full of indentation.

To some degree, language conventions can be natural choices. For example, the Scala convention is 2 space indentation due to how Scala tends to have many blocks, closures, etc.";;
Except 4 space indents are vastly more readable than 2 space indents, so what the hell is wrong with Javascript programmers?;;
In JavaScript, you usually indent more levels than in Python. Using smaller indents lets you do that more often before you get off the screen ;);
If your code requires that many levels of indentation, you're doing it wrong ;);
I was exaggerating of course ;) I suppose this style mainly stems from the callback-hell days.;

Is it always a matter of preference though? I thought it was almost strictly better to use spaces rather than tabs if anyone besides yourself is working on the code because some text editors process tabs in a weird way.;;

This is  a great way of starting a flame war (and please, don't). There is _no_ agreement among programmers on this one, for specific languages.";;
that hasn't stopped you before from spamming your know-it-all opinions.;;
Essentially tabs vs spaces is purely preference. *Mixing* tabs *and* spaces is *usually* a very bad idea. The exception is using tabs for indentation level then spaces to align, but that's usually pretty hard to enforce properly.;;
Definitely a bad idea in this case, since OP is using Python (which, IIRC, cannot mix different forms of indentation).;;
"> but how does it matter how many spaces I use

Basically, consistency across code is good

> and why is it different for different languages?

Different language creators had different preferences, mostly.  Something similar can be seen with naming conventions -- different style guides prefer snake_case, kebab-case, camelCase and PascalCase (i.e. camel case with an initial capital), but the style guides per-language are almost always consistent.  Part of this is that the historical roots of these styles often go decades back, and no-one wants to use a different community's style.";;

That's pre'y neat. Thanks bot.;;
I would first prove to myself that using mutexes, critical sections and RWlocks would be too slow - they very probably won't be. I'd then look at lock-free data structures, such as lock-free queues.;;
"If each thread only ever needs to read/write from it's own buffer (that is it never needs to give any of that data to another thread) then thread-local storage is what you want. It can be portable, just malloc() the memory you need when the thread starts and free it when it finishes. You don't need any locks if that buffer is never used by any other thread. That's actually the fastest method since it's totally lockless.

If you DO need to share the data within the buffer with other threads, then you probably want to use locks. I would recommend taking your big central buffer and divide it into chunks, with one lock per chunk. This could be as simple as just a large array with a lock for every 100 elements or whatever. Each thread would then pick a chunk from the pool, lock it, and work on it. When done it unlocks it and releases it back to the pool. Your goal here is to pick a chunk size such that the time to operate on a chunk is much longer than the time to execute a lock.";;
"Wow, thank you, both solutions look like they would work, however I've another question, for thread-local modifiers in C, there seem to be two different ones.

GCC has _thread, while C11 has _Thread_Local and thread_local. I'm assuming I should use C11, since it's standard, but just asking to make sure. Also curious if they play nicely with pthreads since C11's modifiers are included in their threads.h header.";;
"Those modifiers affect global variables and cause them to be recreated as thread local versions (and thus duplicated). The stack of a thread is always thread local by definition, if you malloc() something within a thread, and store it's pointer on the stack within the thread then it's thread local anyways (since the stack of a thread is always allocated as thread local storage).

And the modifiers should work fine with pthreads, but honestly, I never tried using them and I don't know if there are gotcha's when using them. As I said, the stack of a thread is thread local by definition, and I usually use that with malloc(), you're variable can't be global when doing that, but it shouldn't matter anyways, global variables tend to make multi-threaded programming difficult anyways and their use should be minimized when possible.";;
"How about this example: I have one thread that is accepting connections, and then that thread passes it to another thread. Now that thread may also either fork so it may both recv/send at the same time, or it may create another thread to handle the other portion of the duplex. Imagine if, for some strange reason, it wishes to send and receive a file at the same time...

Now, normally this would not be an issue, but in my case it is as I want to use one central buffer. Now, since it's not global nor is it static (the buffer is contained inside of Buffer_ t, which is included inside of a struct Connection_ t, which was passed to the thread), are both threads able to keep it's own thread-local storage for Buffer_ t if it is declared thread_local/_Thread_Local/__thread?

For more clarity, this is kind of a rough-draft for what I'm thinking for a test...

**Thread A)** Accepts connection, gets Connection_t object from library. Adds it to a thread pool.

**Thread B)** Pooled thread obtains the Connection_t from the task queue, handles any HTTP headers if it's an HTTP request, or maybe something simple like asking for the username if it's a server-client chat. Lets assume the latter and that Thread B either forked or spawned another thread for duplexing.

**Thread C)** Spawned to handle receiving data, while Thread B is sending data. Thread B gets a request to send a file, which uses the buffer as it is needed to read the file to send over the socket. Thread C needs the buffer as well to receive into. (Even if you argue that you could just ask the user for a buffer to use, imagine if you want to receive a file at the same time as sending one)

**(Assuming Thread Local)** Thread C can still receive data from Connection_t without having to worry about Thread B sending a file over the network. Optimal.

**(Assuming not Thread Local w/o Mutex)** Thread B is sending corrupted data and Thread C is receiving corrupted data as they are both being written to at the same time. Very bad.

**(Assuming not Thread Local w/ Mutex)** Thread B can send data, and Thread C can receive data, but only if it synchronizes the use of the buffer for each send and receive. This way at least it can send and receives blocks of information, but this makes it a half-duplex instead of a full duplex. Not good enough.

";;
"Well first:

> Now that thread may also either **fork** so it may both recv/send at the same time

Don't fork, the lock state(s) and file descriptors and network connections gets preserved across a fork but the threads don't. It's rather difficult to fork a multithreaded program without screwing lots of things up.

As for your actual question, you don't want thread local, you want a buffer with locks. Specifically, in your situation thread A can do all the allocation all the time. Thread A should allocate the buffer and fill it with the new connection. It then would put this into a new connection pool, thread B then pulls buffers from the new connection pool, and performs the connection initialization routines. When it's done it spawns a new thread, handing it the buffer. This thread can now operate on the buffer, and releases the buffer when the connection is over.

That covers one directional communication, adding and removing a buffer to a pool requires locks, and that's it.

For multi-direction communication you'll want to figure out what you actually want for reading and writing. If you actually want to do both at the same time, then I would think a Buffer_t is divided into two halves, a read buffer and a write buffer, read operations would only every operate on the read half, write operations would only every operate on the write half. Since they would never overlap you'd never need locking, but you would need to coordinate the shutdown (and freeing) of the buffer, which may require locking.";;
"Now here is another question, since you've been so helpful already. In short-term vs long-term, would it be better to allocate the buffer on the stack for each send/receive file, or two on the heap one-time with locks? 

As in would the benefit of a stack allocation even repeatedly, be better than two heap allocations with a lock? It should also be noted that the buffers could be resized when requested too, so if the buffer size changes each time, realloc also gets called as well.";;
Well allocating it on the stack probably won't work well, especially when using threads where a 2MB stack is common (and it's difficult to pass around when allocated on the stack). I would just allocate on the heap with malloc(), and remember, you can't really write and read to the same spot, so you would need two buffers, if you have two buffers, and only one reader and one writer then you don't really need locks, since the reader would never access the buffer used by the writer, they can both use their own halves of the buffer independently without locks.;;
why do you need to make anything thread local to begin with? you aren't explaining if there even is any concurrent access by multiple threads. If there isn't you can just allocate a buffer on the stack if it's not massive or just allocate on the heap normally and not share the data with other threads. Thread local variables have additional overhead of access.;;
"Kind of a newbish question, but is there a stack-allocation version of a (void *), like how char[] is for (char *)?  void[] really doesn't look right as it looks like an array of void objects, which seems impossible.

As for allocating it on the heap, the reason I'm using a reusable buffer is because I wish to avoid needless allocations. In the end I could do it that way, but I'm trying to optimize my code as best I can.

edit: A word.";;
"no, the void type is not concrete. memory buffers are usually char* or char[] because char is the smallest concrete type in C, and allocations are measured in chars.

> As for allocating it on the heap, the reason I'm using a reusable stack is because I wish to avoid needless allocations. In the end I could do it that way, but I'm trying to optimize my code as best I can.

I think you're missing the point, you do the allocation once and that's it, then you can reuse the memory as many times as you want.";;

You're an intern; this is what it is for. They are here to help you develop. Don't be afraid to ask questions, but also don't be afraid to look up info by yourself and verify it with them. ;
I don't want to be a pest either though, I ask questions pretty gratuitously and the senior devs are getting pretty busy with their own projects so my question asking feels like a hindrance.;;
They were once in your shoes and most likely they'll understand where you are coming from. You should ask questions but of course you should also try to figure things out by yourself aswell. You can take your own time and when you feel overwhelmed, ask help from your co-workers. ;;
A pretty basic guideline that I have used as an intern is try to figure out the answer yourself first no matter what. If it takes you over an hour, then ask someone and tell them what you've tried. They'll appreciate that a lot more than a stream of questions that could be answered by reading docs! ;;
"> I guess I'm finding it hard to learn PHP/working with databases from scratch and feel pretty useless while always asking my coworkers

Asking is better than not. But, especially basic CRUD operations are very well documented. Look out for PDO tutorials, follow them through. It doesn't really take more than a weekend to get a hand for this. The PHP manual has thousands of comments with example that also may help. There will be _much less_ documented software to handle in the future (_cough Magento cough_), so be warned and use the docs as much as you can while it's still possible...";;
"What you're going through right now is essentially what programming is about at first. There will always be some new framework or new language that you've got to write in, and stumbling through the first stages of anything with which you're unfamiliar is rather daunting. I get it~ my new job switched me from mobile to web, and it's been a whirlwind tour de force of wtf why won't this work.

It's perfectly normal to ask for help while you're starting out and there's nothing wrong with that but building up self sufficiency in finding answers to your questions is key to being a good developer (imho). What I mean by that is simply being able to google an issue you're having, read through various types of documentation (official - man pages etc, community - stack overflow posts etc, tutorials from high ranked sites, the list goes on). 

For your example, if you google ""create sql table with php"", you'll find tons of examples and tutorials. If you read through, incoming arbitrary number, 5+ of those tutorials and physically try that code and play with it, but you still can't figure it out -- go ask someone; better yet, ask someone to take a look at the things you've tried and explain why what you did isn't working. 

That'll allow you to have a direct question, see a direct answer and learn from it. 

If you just get frustrated and ask people questions you haven't fleshed out for yourself, I'm sure those senior developers will get real, real tired of your shit. However, if you go to them and say ""I tried X, Y, and Z but couldn't get it to work - can you check this code and see wtf is going on"" they'll be much happier to help as they can see you've put in time on your own, you'll be able to digest the information more easily so as to retain it (hopefully), and you'll have started generating the debug skill set for yourself. 


CS can be frustrating because machines are, to a large extent, infallible and wysiwyg. Put another way, what you fuck up is what you get, so learn to research, learn to troubleshoot, and learn to not let yourself get overwhelmed when approaching difficulties -- simply break them down into small chunks (something you can implement, test, and prove it works before moving onto the next chunk). In the end, that's all programming is. 

Good luck out there";;
"Unless you have a-hole co-workers, they will not be bothered one bit by you asking questions. That's the point of being an intern. I always told my guys that I'd rather have them ask me the same thing 10 times, than do something wrong once, for fear of ""bothering me.""

Now, if you're always asking the same questions and never learning, then you probably won't be kept on after your internship is up (once again, the point of them) but it sounds like you have a decent head on your shoulders, so hopefully as you ask things, you learn.

I.e. if someone spends a half a day walking you through how to set up a contact form and save the data to a database, you should at least be able to look at your finished code and build another, different form. You might have some mistakes or smaller questions, or need help fixing bugs, but you should be able to get the jist of it. 

I was actually on my own learning PHP while working for a company and [this site](http://webmasterworld.com) really helped me a lot. They have a specific section for PHP.

* Download all pictures that those users ever posted in a separate folder.
* Don't overwrite and add new pictures to existing folder

* Accessing the web
* String operations (RegEx is a nice way to do this or even simple substring operations, just to get started)
* Basic System-IO
* Classes can be used (A class for a user, containing the url to the profile, a list with all direct links to the pictures and a download function)
* You will have quick and useful results, while you can add more and more to the program (config file + configurator, previews, multithreading for parallel downloading, using the reddit API, better UI, using json, etc.)

"I am pretty into budgeting my money, and that can take hours per month.

So I recently wrote a program that automatically logs into all of my banking/credit card websites, downloads the OFX files (if available) for processed transactions - scraping when not available - and also grabbing 'Pending Charges"" by scraping the sites as well.

I then load all this information into objects and populate a SQLite database using ORM.

Currently I'm just using a SQLite browser (""DB Browser for SQLite"") with some boolean fields (1/0) that signify whether or not I've added them to my budget, and whether or not they've been processed. I am planning on setting up a simple GUI, but I want to use this software independently for a couple months to work out the kinks.

One of the things on my wishlist for this program are to switch from actual code (using Selenium in C#) to creating my own pseudo-code (read from text files of some sort) to log in etc. So I'd need to write some sort of interpreter. That way it's a piece of cake (no recompiling) if I add a new type of bank or credit card, or one of them changes their website.

I'm not a fan of the automatic-importing things like Mint or Quicken, because it's easy to lose track of what you're buying and why. I like to see every transaction, to remind myself that I'm going to hold myself accountable for wasting money on something I don't need instead of allowing it to be autosorted into some nebulous category.

Which leads to a lot of brainstorming, only to find out that it already exists somewhere most of the time anyway .

My background is in system admin, which means that I spent a lot of time doing repetitive tasks. Learning basic scripting was my first step into programming, and I was able to eventually reduce my workload so much that I had free time to well.. practice more scripting! Then I dove into actual compiled languages and I haven't looked back.

The one time I would say it's fun to rewrite something that already exists is if it doesn't do exactly what you want it to. And definitely compartmentalize - the software I talked about above isn't necessarily very complex, but it's certainly not barebones simple. I started with JUST being able to log into ONE banking website. Then modifying it to log into another. Then breaking it down to follow DRY principals (don't repeat yourself).";;
You Need A Budget. I can't recommend it highly enough. YNAB.com ;;
"That's what I use, but I have a lot of credit cards (don't worry, I'm ridiculously responsible with them and have amazing credit thanks to it) and a couple bank accounts and it's such a pain to manually log into each and every one.

So this makes it REALLY easy for me to see completed transactions, pending charges, and enter them all into YNAB. I run it once a night, takes me literally ~5 minutes, and I'm on top of everything.";;
Cool, glad it's working for you. I find it pretty simple enough to use the app, but I've only got one credit card. ;;
"Yeah, my finances aren't TERRIBLY complex but I think they're too complex to easily manage on YNAB without some sort of assistance. Just the process of logging in and looking at my transactions... visually confirming them, and making sure something didn't slip through the cracks by being posted later... it was all just a big hassle.

Now I can just filter my database to only show things that I haven't marked as 'added' and I'm done real quick. :)";;
Add a few more cards and a wife and it can get tricky fast;;
Beginne Java Programmer here. How the hell do I go about making a program that can access my bank account? ;;
"If your bank offers an API, you can request it directly. I'm not aware of any that do on a consumer level (you'd have to go something through Yodlee, which I think starts at something like 10,000 a year?) so you need to go through the web interface.

Selenium is probably your best bet for Java, short of actually building a pseudo-browser in your code to handle cookies and such (which is much more difficult).

Selenium is a testing framework that allows you to programatically interact with web pages... to use it well enough to get around a bank page, you need to understand some basic HTML and understand XPaths.

Most bank/credit card sites allow you to *manually* download your data via CSV (or other formats) once you log into your site. That's how I get the files - then I process them myself and update a database.";;
Then you either have no problems that can be solved by a program (doubtful), or just aren't thinking hard enough about it (most probable) .....;;

Yes, the obvious alternative is you use your brain and think of something else to make.;;
Even though I don't recommend having student loans for college, CS and similar professional degrees are generally worth it. Many companies look for programmers to have college degrees. Over time the degree will pay over the student loans. You just need to stay motivated for 4 years. I think it's definitely worth it. Just say goodbye to life :D;;
"This. I took on about 30K in student loans during my CS program, but immediately got a 75K/year job after graduation, and have steadily moved up in pay and responsibility since (now, 8 years out, a technical practice lead and product architect). I paid off my loans about 3 years ago, and didn't really struggle to do so. Obviously this differs from company to company, but really not that much (this is my 3rd gig since graduating).

I realized pretty quickly that I was earning significantly more than other guys doing about the same work. What differentiates that discipline to a lot of (especially larger) employers is that everyone *knows* CS is hard. They don't have to wonder if you can strap in a get it working. That adds a little clout to your bargaining power, I think. ";;
"Yeah. And you also can intern at a lot of places if you stick it out in college, which is an even easier way to get your foot in the door and get right into the industry because you will have work experience. 

That's not to say that you can't necessarily intern if you are self-taught, but it doesn't happen a ton (I would assume) and probably isn't a paid internship (again, also assuming), whereas lots of large companies won't let you intern if you aren't in a school program. I'm making $20 an hour interning at a large company doing Java/Spring, which I understand would be a low salary for a full-time dev, but it's more than I've ever made and I couldn't be happier with the learning experience. ";;
"I don't think I'm qualified to give you advice on which to choose, but I can let you know about this.


Computer science is not programming. Some schools take a more applied approach, but at its core, CS is a lot of applied math. It's the study of computation, so expect math courses, especially if you want to get into AI, graphics, computer vision, or even game dev.

I suggest looking at the classes the schools offer and deciding then, I guess.";;
look at software engineering as well. it's much more applied;;
"Interesting, as my school only requires calc 1, calc 2, and a ""discrete mathematics"" course (basics of matrix math/linear algebra).";;
Mine does more or less the same, but different focuses recommend or require higher level math classes. ;;
Mine takes them all way up through Calc 3 and Differential Equations, then linear algebra/discrete mathematics. Poor guys :/;;
Damn that's intense. Our Computer Engineering does that, but CS is what I described above.;;
My school's kinda odd in that the major is actually called Computer Engineering and Computer Science, or CECS. ;;
"Risk vs Reward.

40k isn't a lot in the grand scheme of things especially when your starting salary tends to be in the high five to low six figures.

I would recommend university, people who say ""WELL I'M ONLY BEING TAUGHT THINGS I CAN LEARN ON MY OWN"" really don't understand the full concept of ""university"".

I self-taught myself beginner programming concepts (Java and Basic (lol)) before I was a sophomore in High School. (I also went to community college before I transferred to a 4 year, so I understand where your coming from)

However, I would NEVER give up the experience and amount of RESOURCES my university provided to me. 

Yes the classes are boring as shit especially when you know *Think* you know it all, but the ability to have a mentor guide you, the ability to network and learn with future peers and with professors is what your truly gaining with University Experience.

I feel like most people will always run into the folks who just do the bare minimal then bitch that they receive the bare minimal compensation later on.

Thanks to what my school provided, I was able to graduate with a 3.8, Study aboard in China for a summer, Interned twice at the largest defense contractor, performed undergraduate research for 3 years and was president of my IEEE and ACM clubs at school.

With just these experiences alone, I was able to join an awesome company and start my career really easily compared to some of my peers whom are still looking for a starting place three years out of college!";;

Fresh out of college with a decent GPA and resume (undergrad research, internships, side projects (THESE ARE IMPORTANT BECAUSE THEY PROVE YOU CAN TAKE WHAT YOU LEARNED AND APPLY IT TO REAL LIFE)) will earn you high five figures to low six figures (or compensation equaling that much, such as options, perks vacation etc etc) in most areas in the US;;
That's good, thanks for the tips on projects etc, I plan on finding internships, as I'm gonna be in the RTP area im hoping there will be a handful to apply for;;
Really, this would be better suited on /r/cscareerquestions.  However, what is it that you actually want to learn?;;
"A programming language, the vocabulary, ect. I basically want to be a programmer without spending 40,000 dollars.

I more so want to learn enough of one language that learning another language isn't hard at all and I can adapt.";;
If you just want to learn one language, then taking four years of computer science is way overkill.  Even if you just want to become a software developer (which involves a lot more than learning a language), much of what a CS curriculum covers would be of little relevance.;;
"Computer science doesn't teach you programming. It's very clear that someone given enough time and dedication could learn that stuff on their own.

What do you get though going to a university?

1. Network - Incredibly valuable that you'll meet some peers which will go on to work at companies you may eventually want to work at. And it is far easier to get a job via a referral than to apply via the black hole that is the careers page for a company.
2. Diversity - Self study, while effective, has the problem of you picking what you want to learn (or think you should know) vs what you should *actually* know. You're going to have the opportunity to be exposed to diverse topics, some of which aren't actually programming at all, but will be very helpful. Other point is something my college roommate once told me ""You don't know what you don't know"". This means that you may find yourself uber confident that you've mastered X, only to find someone else knows far more about X than you can possibly imagine. That only happens when you interact with other people.
3. Resume filter - you pass the silly CS resume filter.";;
"All it comes down to is, what you come out of your given path with. 

A college degree gives you a diploma (says you can meet deadlines, do work assigned to you, more than likely work in teams, and other skills which are essential to a business) as well as a portfolio of projects, displaying you have coding knowledge. This as well as the connections to companies through your school.

A self taught programmer will only have a portfolio. That means, this portfolio will have to blow the others out of the water, since it is your only real saving grace. The best course of action would be to work as you're learning it. To find a lower end job as a web dev isn't difficult, but it will be building your resume. You then still have to work at it outside of work. Without a diploma, it'll be harder to get your face in the door unless you have something to show them that makes you more attractive than someone with an equal amount of work, but also showing that they have some of those skills which are essential to working for a company. This can be an amazing portfolio, work experience or a variety of other things, but you'll have to spend a lot of time and more effort getting your name out there.";;
"IT and programming has some overlap, but they definitely have their own career path. Are you no longer interested in the IT path? Or do you just want to also know how to program?

If you still enjoy IT, I would stick with your degree and start learning to write scripts to automate/test things on the side. Obviously a shell language like bash or powershell will be useful. You might also want something like Python or Ruby when you need a little bit more powerful of a tool.";;
"It's just the only Computer related degree in my Community College and my family wanted me to get a degree.

I like programming more than IT. By far. I've messed around with it for a VERY tiny minute. Nothing noticeable, and I like it much better than networking/tech support.";;
Couldn't you self learn while doing the CC thing? If you get a good grasp on programming and want to go for a better degree, a lot of those credits could transfer to a four year school;;
"ill tell you now op ive been working for a company where people with IT degrees end up, ive watched countless numbers of them fly in with an IT degree, then get pissed off cause they have to start chasing certs ""i thought my education was over"" etc etc. at this point they either do 1 of 2 things, stay and dont progress, or progress and leave.

if youre content with the idea of chasing certifications for the rest of your employment and doing misc IT work, stick with the IT degree... im not sure if youll need to constantly learn new languages because i just started programming but to me it seems like, you learn a few, then spend the rest of your time mastering them, if that sounds more interesting, take a look at what courses transfer to a 4 year and take as many of those as you can at the community college, keep your gpa high and transfer to a good uni and do CS.

The key reason to get a software degree if you want to do: game design, ai, low level computing, research or need the structure.

"As someone who's currently a junior pursuing a CS degree with a minor in maths, and spends a lot of my free time learning web development, I'd say that CS is a bit overkill for that particular field (programming), with all of the frameworks and such. It will definitely give you an edge though. 

If you enjoy something, you can learn everything that you would learn at school on your own. That goes for every field, not only CS.

I think the greatest benefit of majoring in CS is the knowledge of truly knowing how to study the subject and with the added bonus of being constantly exposed to the act of coding so it becomes second nature to you (coupled with the dedication to actually do it, even when you think you already know how to solve the problem). The math minor has mostly taught me how to find errors in my logic, as well as teach me that no matter how lost you are on a problem, you WILL understand it thoroughly if you keep trying (and hopefully think things through enough to make less errors in general).

That being said, I have a friend who recently graduated with an IT degree with a focus on InfoSec and he's a damn good web dev.... But again... If you truly enjoy programming, you'll spend enough time doing it and taking on your own projects that you'll learn most of it anyway.";;

"IT is computer science in the same way that being a quickie lube tech is automotive engineering.  

Nothing wrong with IT. It's a decent field, but it is nothing like programming, which itself is a minor part of computer science.

You might teach yourself programming, but you almost certainly won't teach yourself computer science.  It's a very different world, and one you'll likely find fascinating and terrifying if you do it right.

By it's nature, true CS is theory, and the problem with being self-taught is you don't know what you don't know.  Practical parts of computing (programming) can be self-taught (I did it) but you really need an expert to take you through the theory.  

I was a talented part-time programmer who thought I was something until I started learning about CS.  I had to learn all over again, but now I teach CS for a living (and have done so for 20 years.)

A full-blown CS degree will definitely pay off.  Note that the skills you learn in your IT program probably will not count towards a university CS program.  

Here's a thought:
Get an associate's degree in math or pre-engineering. These degrees are actually better preparation for CS than IT.

Teach yourself programming.  Python's a good starting language, and the web languages are pretty forgiving (you don't need frameworks, you don't need to make anything 'real world.'  You just need experience programming.)

If you get decent at programming, your chances of finding some kind of work that will help pay for a four-year degree increase dramatically.

If you're lucky, you may get the job you want without needing the degree, but it sounds like you'd be happier with it. ";;
If you decide on the degree approach try to get a part time job or do some projects yourself.

"Firstly, printf(), fflush() etc. are _not_ system calls. They are calls to functions in the C Standard Library. Standard C does not provide any means of making system calls.

This is something of a council of perfection however - I don't think I have ever checked the return value of fflush() and only rarely that of printf(). However, I _always_ check the return value of functions like scanf().

> How do I even check for all cases where it potentially can fail and correct them?

You can't. Many errors involve irreversible changes to the state of the program - it seems to me you are obsessing a bit much about error handling.

"It's good defensive coding to make sure you can handle all possible failures per your program's needs.

> I suppose like exotic said though, I'm trying too hard to ""fix"" any possible errors, and I should just log them and let the user handle such things if it's their fault

Yes, but you need to be very careful about it. Getting ""undefined behavior"" in C is a big vector for security issues.

"It can depend, but in general I try to check them, some like malloc, I don't bother, it returns NULL on error which results in a safe crash on error, and malloc() doesn't actually return an error if you're out of memory, but instead returns an error when you're out of virtual memory (which is a rather difficult thing to do on a 64-bit system).

I think you also need to think of the side effects as well, how is printf really going to fail? Your inputs should be sanitized to the point that a broken pipe (when the terminal is closed) is the only real failure you should expect, and that will just result in a crash (you normally wouldn't catch that error). fflush() wouldn't normally result in a terrible error either, and any error that does happen should also happen when fread() is called, and fread() is one of the ones you should be checking, as errors there are much more common.

Also I very often do NOT check errno, often you'll know there are no errors you can handle, so if it returns an error you just leave it at that and bail. Others will return many errors, but only one you can handle, so you check that, and if that's not the error you can handle you just bail.";;

"You want some kind of *source control*.  Check out something like GitHub.  There are other solutions as well - GitHub is build on Git, but there is also Subversion, Mercurial, and a few others.

As for your edit. You have few choices. If you are a student, get a github education pack, it gives you private repos for free. Other option is to use Bitbucket which gives you private repos as default. Or you can use Gitlab and host the version control yourself on your comp. Pick  your poison;;
What language are you mostly using?;;
"So it seems like you have the basics down. Now you can start looking into how to actually structure things. In general you want to try to separate the html from the js as much as possible. 

One popular way to do this is by building objects in the JS that represent the data. We call that the viewmodel. Then we have the view which is the HTML and that gets what data to populate it's field with from the viewmodel. 

For example, think about how hard it would be to make your weather display pull from a weather API instead of static information. You would have to create new dom objects for each day to keep your current approach. Instead you could keep a big array of ""weather"" objects in the JS and simply update the information in the fields when the right or left button was pressed.";;
So I should basically make it so that there is only one card and then with JavaScript or jQuery I only update the values? Would that be the mvc pattern? Because I definitely wanted to learn more about patterns soon.;;
It's actually the MVVM pattern. There is some overlap between the MVC and MVVM pattern and its not really either/or as they kind of solve two different problems. Alot of places use both and call it MVCVM or some other similar conglomeration of capital letters. Don't get hung up on acronyms, the goal is that you can easily change the view(html/css in your case) or the model(the data you've stored in the HTML in your example) without worrying about what the hell is going on in the other parts.;;
Alright, thanks a lot man. ;;
"I can't speak to the best practices with the technologies you are working with, but in general you would reduce the model to exactly what the view needs in the controller and send the view that. This reduced thing is called a viewmodel. 

In a bigger project you might have an object with a lot of members that might not all be accessible to every user. You might want to let coworkers view an Employee's contanct info but not his salary for instance. In this case it makes security infinitely less complex if you don't ever pass the salary info to the view.";;
"Ah, that makes sense. I was not familar with viewmodels. Now let's suppose that the view needs to fill 7 fields in it's window.

It will ask the controller (which in turn asks the model). The controller 'decodes' the object into a custom class (called view model) and passes the viewmodel object to the view. The view and view-model are coupled.

Does the above implementation make sense?";;
Absolutely. The viewmodel can also then be serialized and used on the front end as the viewmodel for a framework like Angular or Bootstap.;;
Be very [modular](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_programming). A function should having a specific purpose, do only one thing, and be relatively short (if your functions are getting into the 40 lines range you should reconsider what you're doing).;;
This is a book-worthy question! Take a look at *Clean Code* and *Refactoring*.;;
"dependency injection would help a lot as well in my opinion.

Also, unit test more. By unit testing, you force yourself to make things into smaller chunks. If your unit tests become complex, or you do something odd to test a ""private"" function, then odds are it should be broken into smaller chunks. 

Testing will give you the confidence to alter your program but not break it. ";;
So unit testing...?;;
"unit testing is a must if you want to be able to change things without worrying about breaking other things.

Dependency inject will help you create isolated objects which makes testing easier. ";;
Depending on what language you're using an IDE can greatly help with refactoring.;;
Currently, I'm using intellij. Its pretty helpful. But I feel like I could have avoided this situation. ;;

"    while(user !== 'ASSASSIN' || 'FIGHTER')

This is a common beginner mistake. The problem is you can't just make up notation and expect it to work; you need to think about how the language is treating what you write. I don't know what language you're coding it (I'm guessing JavaScript) but the way this is parsed is that first `user !== 'ASSASSIN'` is checked. If it is true, then we're done, because then the whole thing is true. Otherwise, `'FIGHTER'` is checked. In a boolean context, `'FIGHTER'` is `true` (it's non-zero,non-null-non-undefined), which makes the whole thing true. 

You need to say `while(user !== 'ASSASSIN' || user !== 'FIGHTER')` . BUT this also is not what you want, is it? Because this is also always true, because `user` is definitely not equal to one of those two things, so that also is always true. So you actually want to say `while(user !== 'ASSASSIN' && user !== 'FIGHTER')`";;

For one, you're hardcoding your paths to the executable. If you need to change the paths in the future, you'll need to recompile your program. I suppose it's not a big issue if you've got a small program, but if you're working on a large codebase, I'd say it's more favorable to be able to edit a configuration file instead.;;
"Most frameworks allow you to define rules for local and production environments and this has come about from real world experience.

Imagine you are maintaining a codebase with something morally equivalent and the original author isn't around to tell you to swap out `EnvironmentEnum` with `.production` before you deploy.  I shouldn't have to tell you that leaking your development environment into production code can be a major problem.

Best practice is often a synonym for least surprises and in this regard automatic, framework level configurations beat hard coded global behaviours.  Configuration is accessible to anyone who can google the framework but hard-coded is only known to the person who wrote it.

It seems like, ideally, you look up the word and then you get the frequencies across all the documents from that one query right? So, you could do an hash table or red black tree (which are presumably the implementations for `std::unordered_map` and `std::ordered_map` respectively) on the words where you're storing a vector or array of information on each document. You could also do a [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) which could be more space efficient than the hash table, but probably not  really worth it unless you genuinely foresee having a problem with memory (especially since the C++ standard library doesn't have an implementation). ;;

that should do it for you, obviously psuedocode... The idea is to use the length to find the center, then start swapping using a temp to hold the value of the first swap.

    document.getElementById(""button"").onclick = a;

and then in the function `a`, change this to call `b`. 

Note: I'm assuming you change the id of the button to `button` instead of the `div`, because it really doesn't make sense to call the `div` button, because it's not a `button` it's a `div`, and that would be confusing to anyone reading the javascript.

Regex is the wrong approach for this task; it's true that some languages have regex engines that support more than just regular grammars, and it might then be *technically* possible to parse HTML with regex, but I wouldn't do it if I were you -  check out [this absurdly long regex](http://www.ex-parrot.com/pdw/Mail-RFC822-Address.html) for the apparently simpler task of email validation.

If you are interested in parsing real world HTML from the web, you will want to use a library for it. Real world HTML is often malformed, and browsers are still expected to try and make sense of it. I've used [this library](https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser) successfully before but there's unfortunately not much documentation on it.

If you want to write a simple HTML parser as a learning exercise, I would look into [recursive descent parsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser). Recursive descent parsers are straightforward to understand, easy to write by hand, and the code closely follows the structure of the code you are parsing. In addition, for LL(1) grammars, recursive descent parsing takes linear time, so it's efficient too.";;

>In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science), a __recursive descent parser__ is a kind of [top-down](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing) [parser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) built from a set of [mutually recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_recursion) procedures (or a non-recursive equivalent) where each such [procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_(computer_science\)) usually implements one of the [productions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Production_(computer_science\)) of the [grammar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar). Thus the structure of the resulting program closely mirrors that of the grammar it recognizes. 

>A *predictive parser* is a recursive descent parser that does not require [backtracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). Predictive parsing is possible only for the class of [LL(*k*)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser) grammars, which are the [context-free grammars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar) for which there exists some positive integer *k* that allows a recursive descent parser to decide which production to use by examining only the next *k* tokens of input. The LL(*k*) grammars therefore exclude all ambiguous grammars, as well as all grammars that contain [left recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left_recursion). Any context-free grammar can be transformed into an equivalent grammar that has no left recursion, but removal of left recursion does not always yield an LL(*k*) grammar. A predictive parser runs in [linear time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_time).

>Recursive descent with backtracking is a technique that determines which production to use by trying each production in turn. Recursive descent with backtracking is not limited to LL(k) grammars, but is not guaranteed to terminate unless the grammar is LL(k). Even when they terminate, parsers that use recursive descent with backtracking may require [exponential time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_time).

"Yes, I have seen that post before.
I already took the guess that regex might not be the right thing. :)

I usually use a library for HTML parsing too. In this case however I am more interested in how it works so I will take a look at the wikipedia article, thank you.";;
"""Real"" parsers tend to be top-down or bottom-up affairs. Top-down, [recursive descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser) parsers tend to be the easiest to write and understand, in myexperience.";;
"Thanks, ""recursive descent parser"" was the search term I was looking for.";;
"My favourite way is parser combinators.

The basic idea is that you have a bunch of parametric type `Parser`.  A `Parser a` object does some parsing and then returns a value of type `a`.
  For example, you might have a `num` object of type `Parser Int` that parses an integer and then returns it, and `op` object of type `Parser Operator` that parses an operator and returns some kind of value representing it.  If `f` is a function that takes an `Int`, an `Operator`, and an `Int` and returns an `Int`, you can then do something like `combine(f, num, op, num)` which will try to parse `num`, `op`, then `num` and if all three succeed, apply `f` to the result.  So `combine` is again a `Parser Int`.";;
"Other people have mentioned recursive descent parsing.  You should probably look into [BNF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus%E2%80%93Naur_Form), a way of writing down the grammar you're parsing.

There are 3 common approaches people use for writing parsers:

* Handwritten parsers

 * Exactly what it sounds like, and often pretty tedious.  It's pretty easy to give good ad-hoc error messages with handwritten parsers, though.

* Parser Generators

 * You write down the grammar in an external dsl, often with syntax similar to BNF, and use a tool like ANTLR, Alex, or BISON to generate a source file that parses that grammar.  ANTLR code, for example, looks like

.
    
    grammar Expr;		
    prog:	(expr NEWLINE)* ;
    expr:	expr ('*'|'/') expr
        |	expr ('+'|'-') expr
        |	INT
        |	'(' expr ')'
        ; 
    NEWLINE : [\r\n]+ ;
    INT     : [0-9]+ ;


* Parser Combinators

 * Parser Combinator libraries provide a mechanism to *combine* smaller parsers into larger parsers, as well as trivial parsers.  For example, you might have something like

.

    -- using the parsec library in Haskell
    parseExpr :: Parser LispVal
    parseExpr = parseAtom
             <|> parseString -- <|> is an infix operator that takes two parsers, and runs the second if the first fails.
             <|> parseNumber";;

Thank you! I will give this a try;;
Better yet, don't use an array unless you absolutely need to.  Use a IList<T> if you need to add something, otherwise, leave the container as an IEnumerable<T> as long as possible.;;
"You don't need any of those `D` variables, just pass the correct index of the array directly to the functions (at least I think that's what you're trying to do, it's very confusing).  For example:

    switch (strArr[0])
    {
        case ""transform"":
          _transform(strArr[1], strArr[2], strArr[3])
        ....";;

It's for a game! the player can set respawn points and commit suicide if it gets stuck anywhere.;;
Why are you setting up D4 and D5 (with default values) if none of the options actually uses input beyond D3?;;
They have since been used :) I am in the middle of writing this up and had the intention to use at least 6.;;
"Sure!

    if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Return) || shortcut == true)
    {
        userinput = userinput.ToLower();
        string[] splitInput = userinput.Split('_');
        string[] args = { ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"" };
        Array.Copy(splitInput, args, splitInput.Length);

        switch (args[0])
        {
            case ""transform"":
                _Transform(args[1], args[2], args[3]);
                break;
            case ""add"":
                _Add(args[1], args[2], args[3]);
                break;
            case ""assign"":
                _Assign(args[1], userinput);
                break;
            case ""set"":
                _Set(args[1], args[2], args[3]);
                break;
            case ""suicide"":
                _Suicide();

            default:
                Debug.Log(""ERR"");
                break;
        }
    }

You could make **this** even shorter by having a `Dictionary<string, Action<string[], string>>` (dictionary where the key is a string and the value is an action which accepts a string array and a string as an argument). You'll just need a bit longer initialization:

    // In your class, outside your method
    private static Dictionary<string, Action<string[], string>> actions;

    MyClass() // In your class' constructor
    {
        InitializeActions();
    }

    void InitializeActions()
    {
        actions = new Dictionary<string, Action<string[], string>>
        {
            {
                ""transform"",
                (args, rawString) => _Transform(args[1], args[2], args[3])
            },
            {
                ""add"",
                (args, rawString) => _Add(args[1], args[2], args[3])
            },
            {
                ""assign"",
                (args, rawString) => _Assign(args[1], rawString)
            },
            {
                ""set"",
                (args, rawString) => _Set(args[1], args[2], args[3])
            },
            {
                ""suicide"",
                (args, rawString) => _Suicide()
            }
        };
    }

Now, your method can be as short as this:

    if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Return) || shortcut == true)
    {
        userinput = userinput.ToLower();
        string[] splitInput = userinput.Split('_');
        string[] args = { ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"" };
        int len = (splitInput.Length > args.Length ? args.Length : splitInput.Length);
        Array.Copy(splitInput, args, len);
        actions[args[0]](args, userinput);
    }";;
This is wonderful! Thank you for the help. I think I have plenty to play around with now.;;
"I'm not sure how familiar you're with C#, so here's some further details of the things used in the snippet:

[This](http://i.imgur.com/5W8dz0r.png) is called a [Collection initializer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb384062.aspx). It works with any class which implements the interface `IEnumerable`, such as `List<T>` or `Array<T>`:

    List<string> list = new List<string>
    {
        ""abc"",
        ""def""
    };
    string[] array = new string[] { ""toast"" };
    // Shorter syntax for arrays:
    string[] array2 = new [] { ""toast"" };
    // Even shorter:
    string[] array3 = { ""toast"" };

If you don't want to use the collection initializer for whatever reason, you can also add the keys and values like this:

    actions = new Dictionary<string, Action<string[], string>>();
    actions.Add(""transform"", (args, rawString) =>
        _Transform(args[1], args[2], args[3]));
    actions.Add(""add"", (args, rawString) =>
        _Add(args[1], args[2], args[3]));

This thingy:

    (args, rawString) => _Transform(args[1], args[2], args[3])

is a [lambda expression](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb397687.aspx). This is essentially the same as creating a new [`Action`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/018hxwa8.aspx):

    new Action<string[], string>(delegate(string[] args, string rawString)
    {
        _Transform(args[1], args[2], args[3]);
    })

If you change your methods just a little bit, the following would be possible (thanks to method group conversion):

    // Modified methods:
    void _Transform(string[] input) { /* ... */ }
    void _Add(string[] input) { /* ... */ }
    void _Assign(string[] input) { /* ... get rawString from the array instead ... */ }
    void _Set(string[] input) { /* ... */ }
    void _Suicide() { /* ... */ }

    private Dictionary<string, Action<string[]>> actions;
    
    MyClass()
    {
        InitializeActions();
    }
    
    void InitializeActions()
    {
        actions = new Dictionary<string, Action<string[]>>
        {
            { ""transform"", _Transform },
            { ""add"", _Add },
            { ""assign"", _Assign },
            { ""set"", _Set },
            { ""suicide"", args => _Suicide() }
        };
    }

    // Your method
    if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.Return) || shortcut == true)
    {
        userinput = userinput.ToLower();
        string[] splitInput = userinput.Split('_');
        string[] args = { ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"", ""0"" };
        int len = (splitInput.Length > args.Length ? args.Length : splitInput.Length);
        Array.Copy(splitInput, args, len);
        actions[args[0]](args);

"You won't overwrite the bootstrap files if you are using the css version.  You need to compile your own version from the scss.

Create a main scss file that imports your components.

Then import bootstrap first.

    // Bootstrap
    @import ""bootstrap/bootstrap"";
    
    // Locals
    @import ""variables"";
    @import ""mixins"";
    
    // Components imports go here
    
    @import ""loader"";
    ....


Use grunt watch and sass to do your compiling.  It will re-compile every time you make a change.

Or...

Use mixins to make custom buttons.  It will help address all the blur, focus, onClick, etc stuff for you.  From mixins/_buttons.scss:

    @mixin button-variant($color, $background, $border) {
      color: $color;
      background-color: $background;
      border-color: $border;

So implement it like this:

_variables.scss:

    // charcoal
    $primary-color: #474343;
    // white
    $secondary-color: #fff;

add this class (or any other class):

    .btn-custom {
        // args - color, background, border
        @include button-variant($secondary-color, $primary-color, $secondary-color);

"Thank you so much, it's working now and most of it makes sense. I import all the bootstrap stuff and local variables into my main.scss, which I then use as a starting point for every stylesheet in the app. When I want to customize a specific component I just include the mixin for that component and supply some custom variables or, if I need even more control, make my own custom version of the mixin. 
One question though. What do you mean by components imports? ";;
"Don't go down this path if you are still learning the foundations of things.  This is a more complex process that leads to faster development once you understand it.  It would be like learning to drive a right-side drive manual lamborghini in NYC instead of trying to learn on an automatic minivan in the old factory parking lot.  With that said...

I do most of my development in a style called AMD ([asynchronous module definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_module_definition)) used by require.js and Dojo.  I do a lot of work in Dojo as a prerequisite for my job.  You will find you may write a lot of really long, single file JS, HTML, CSS files.  This is how you can avoid that.

So, I'll have my HTML file load a simple script that mostly just launches my main.js file.  This file controls all the other js files I will use in my application.  What other files?  Well, that is where AMD shines.  I don't have an entire app written in one GIANT JavaScript file.  I break out each of the components into their own JS files and use my main.js just to manage them.

For example, take your standard app and make them components

* Header

* Footer
 
* Navigation

* Reports

* Map

* Splash screen

 etc.

Now I have a file for each component.  I break each component down further into:

* view(name).js
* controller(name).js
* template(name).html

I start with the template.  This is the HTML that is used to create the component.  No more 1,000+ line long HTML documents. Now I have ~10 lines to look at when I want to change my header.

How do I use this HTML?  Look into a library like Backbone.  This can be fairly easily implemented to take X html template and stick it into Y single element.

So my index.html has NOTHING in the body.  I create a layout template and inject it into the body tag.  My layout template has nothing more than header-container, footer-container, etc. as divs.  No content, just empty divs.

What about the view?  I take the HTML found in templateHeader.html and stick it in header-container.  Now all of that HTML is injected into the layout view -> body of index.html.  I can also bind events here - things that always happen but are only invoked once, like:

    buttonX.on('click', function(){
      alert('This is a button click!');
    });

Okay, what about the controller?  This is where I stick functions related to that component that might be called over and over.  I use this a lot with mapping.  Something like:

    placePoint(lat,lng){
      ....
    };

Now I can include my controller JS file into any other JS file and use mapController.placePoint(lat,lng);

What else?  

* You can do this with CSS as well.  It is called Sass (my preference) or Less.  This has another minor layer of complexity because you need to compile scss files into CSS.  It isn't terribly difficult though.
*  **Oh, my favorite!** - No one can see your source code.  If you view the source of my pages it lists an empty body and a small JavaScript that launches another JS (which they can't see). ";;

Well, you do have to compile it. As you can see, you have a source package. It's not very useful until compiled to a binary. You can do one of two things:

1. Build a static library out of the two source files. Then, keep the static library in some folder as /u/deanmsands3 mentioned, and indicate the folder and and static library in your project options.
2. Just include the two source files in your project, so that when your code is compiled, the matplot code will be compiled along with it. You still have to indicate the header file location as above.";;

"An auction system where clients are allowed to place bids without seeing the current bid? Then the setter would only change the actual value if the new bid was higher, and at the end of the round the class would call back the client that made the highest bid.  
Although considering the ""place bid"" routine as a setter seems like the wrong kind of abstraction.";;
It kind of does, doesn't it. Even if you had a Bid class which held the monetary bid and the bidder's reference, the call for the bid to be applied to the auction wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. One might be able to keep the property-ish call if the property was an EventHandler, though... e.g. Auction.Bids += myBid, or something.;;
Purely academically; sure. Anytime you only care about 'writing' and not reading a value. But obviously this is a rare scenario.;
"The only thing that comes to mind would be just a hypothetical situation. In this situation you want to set individual variables that affect an output, without necessarily needing to read the individual variables. The following code is what I mean:

	public class Time {
		public Time() {
			// Set defaults
		}
		private int hour;
		public void setHour(int hour) {
			this.hour = hour;
		}
		private int minute;
		public void setMinute(int minute) {
			this.minute = minute;
		}
		private int second;
		public void setSecond(int second) {
			this.second = second;
		}

		public String getFormattedTime() {
			// Return the time in a specific, human-readable format
		}
	}

	public class Driver {
		public static void main(String[] args) {
			Time time = new time();
			System.out.println(""Time is: "" + time.getFormattedTime()); // Prints 8:16:41
			time.setHour(12);
			System.out.println(""Time is: "" + time.getFormattedTime()); // Prints 12:16:41
		}
	}

Here we only actually need to read the formatted time per the implementation, however we have the ability to set the individual variables should we need to adjust the time. Although this wouldn't be necessarily used in the real world, it does however represent a situation with a public set and a private get (In this situation we're just accessing the private attribute without the use of a getter)";;
"I see! A situation where individual properties affect another property which gives the ""valid"" output. Very interesting scenario!";;
I can think of a lot of reasons why you would want to have a public setter and no getter.  However private getters don't make much sense to me because the member variable is already accessible to the class so they would have no value over `this.var` or are named incorrectly.;;
It's unusual because typically, if the caller is able to set a value, the caller usually should also be able to fetch the value.  Prohibiting this is syntactically possible, but uncommon because someone who just set the value presumably knows what the value is, so you don't gain much by hiding the getter.;;
As /u/Kabitu said, that isn't really necessary, as the setter could choose not to change the value.;;

"While writing code in paper should definitely not be the only method of testing progression in learning programming, I wouldn't write it off. If executed properly (seems like it may not be in your case), it's perfectly valid - I'm currently majoring in CS at an Ivy League university and part of my exams last semester involved hand-writing code.


However, the point was not to have us write fully-functional, syntactically correct code but rather to test whether we could roughly lay out the algorithm or approach to solving a problem in either pseudocode or the language itself. ";;
"Yeah , i agree completely... Writing a rough layout seems much more reasonable. I've even heard of professors at my uni trying to run the code we write on paper and if it doesn't run you get an automatic 0... Just beyond stupid in my opinion...
";;
Wow, that is sad to hear. The education system is really crappy, I mean seriously write code without debugging how stupid people at your university are? I feel so bad for you.;;
"Obligatory 'old man rant' here.

The implication here is that debugging can only be done on a computer.  That's simply not true.  In the old days (which I wouldn't wish on anyone) we often didn't touch the computer at all.  We'd write code on punch cards and get a readout the next day.  Back then you didn't just write half-baked code and see how it broke.  You'd design it very carefully and test it on paper and in your brain, because you might not get to run it twice on a computer.

Even though this was a painful way to learn, it did teach us that programming isn't necesarrily something done on a computer, and you can (and often must) debug without a computer.  The most difficult bugs, in fact usually aren't easy to spot with interactive debugging, but are best anticipated by understanding exactly what's going on.  ";;
"But it's 21st century and it'd be dumb to get 0 just because you forgot to put a semi-colon at the end or something. Every programmer makes mistakes even the professional ones.

Since you were teached the other way, I'd like to ask you. Are you now a really good programmer after learning to code in such way?";;
"I'm a decent programmer.  I've been doing it for many years commercially (I still code for a living as well as teaching) and I teach and write books on programming.  I've taught thousands of people how to program and I've produced innumerable apps, desktop apps, and libraries.

I wouldn't give someone a zero for a missing semicolon, but the computer will (if not compiling means you get a zero.)  

Syntax matters, and details matter.  However, that's actually the easy part, so I don't really focus on it too much.  The hard part is getting your ideas organized so well that you can explain to an idiot computer what you're trying to do.  

I don't normally give exams that ask programmers to write complete code, because I don't care that much about the conversion from algorithm to code.  Google can help you do that.

I do often ask people to write complete algorithms in pseudocode, and if that algorithm is not so clearly written that each line can be easily translate to a line of code in pretty much any language, the algorithm is not finished.

The truly wonderful search engines, editors, compilers, interpreters, and debuggers we have today will generally help you so much with syntax that you can guess and get pretty close.  This might make you think that you don't have to think through your problems before you write them.  That's a very misleading state of affairs, though, because the real key to programming well isn't the syntax (which is what these tools are good at) but the algorithms.  NOTHING will replace understanding how to think through a problem at a fundamental level.  That has always been done best without a computer.

I still do require my students to turn in an algorithm and plan for every program on paper before they write any major project.  They whine and complain, and often don't do it.  

Then they fly by the seat of their pants and have a program that does not work and they don't know why. Then eventually they decide to back up and write the algorithm (often after a tearful session in my office feeling stupid and inadequate.)  Eventually they see that writing out an algorithm on paper (or a state transition diagram, flow diagram, ER diagram, UML - whatever's appropriate for the project at hand) is indeed the smartest way to go.  

It's a developmental stage most programmers go through.";;
Writing code on paper makes perfect sense as a formative exercise. The point isn't (or, at least, shouldn't be) to test your knowledge of syntactic minutia. The point is to train your ability to devise the right structure for a complex program in your head. In other words, your ability to think first and only then write code. Although progress has been made in developing refactoring-friendly technologies (such as IDEs or strong type systems like Haskell's), it's still all too common in the real world for us programmers to paint ourselves into a corner with our own design decisions. Developing our ability to *foresee* the consequences of our designs can never hurt.;;
"What does ""something wasn't right in the definition of a function"" mean?";;
One of the arguments of the function was the wrong type. I think it was a char instead of a pointer to a char. All the meanwhile inside the function i was working with a pointer to a char(thats what i had in mind). I just forgot to put a *.;;
That's a pretty big mistake, though.  I wouldn't say it deserves no points, but confusing chars with pointers to chars is an error that absolutely needs to be pointed out and eradicted early on.;;
"That's not a syntax mistake, really.  

If you're in C or C++, the difference between a char and a pointer to a char (which will eventually resolve to a string) is extremely significant, and the fact that you got this incorrect is a big indicator that you don't understand this important fact about C-style strings.  

You could make an argument about whether beginning programmers should have to worry about these things. (That's why I save C for the second course) but if you're in C, this is not a trivial mistake, and it's nowhere near the 'missing semicolon' brainfart.  It's a fundamental part of the language.  The professor did in fact correctly diagnose a mistake in your thinking.  Note that most editors would not have caught this (because the syntax is completely legal, if not what you intended) and the resulting error (if there even was one) would be cryptic and misleading.  More likely the program would have 'mostly worked'  which would have left you more confused.  ";;
"As i said, it was a mistake in writing...I simply forgot to write a * in the definition...Later on in the function it was always used as a pointer to a char. So the only mistake i made is that while frantically trying to write down the code so i can finish everything in time i forgot a * in the beginning. How is this something that should be punished with 0 points? From my point of view , this mistake would have been easily noticeable if i was looking at it on a monitor(even without compiling or running), instead of a little test ""notebook"" we get for the test.";;
"I think progress in learning programming can be difficult to test. Someone with a month of experience can solve the same problems as someone with 5 years experience, but the novice programmer might solve the problem in a more naive way.

It's like testing someone's progress while they're learning to draw or paint. 

That being said, I think writing code on paper is pretty common for intro to programming classes. I had to do the same thing at my school, and it's a good exercise. When your hands aren't on the keyboard, it's like a whole different world. It takes longer to erase and rewrite a section of code when you're writing on paper, so I think it forces you to think a little bit more about what you're about to write. 

When you're starting out, writing short programs, it's easy to write an entire program, realize that your solution isn't quite working out, and start over again if you're typing. 

Plus you will probably be expected to write code on a whiteboard during interviews and if you end up working with a team when you get a job. Good skill to be comfortable with.";;
"To answer your broader question, the best way to tell how much somebody has advanced in a certain language is to have them work on multiple complex projects to demonstrate their mastery. However, the problem is that doing this properly is a very long process/is not scalable. You can use homework assignments to approximate this process, but it's highly unreasonable to expect students to complete an entire project over the course of a single exam.

Furthermore, if your teacher gives out regular quizzes as a teaching tool (to force you to be detail-oriented + stay on top of the material), then it also becomes even more difficult to ask increasingly complex questions. Somebody has to grade all those quizzes/exams, after all, and the more complex the problems, the longer it'll take to grade, which means your teacher will have less time to focus on teaching or will have to delay on returning the quizzes, which will lead to a lower feedback loop. Both alternatives are bad for the students, so your teacher needs to find and maintain the right balance.

That's probably why your teacher is providing multiple choice questions. It takes some time to create a good multiple choice question, but in compensation they're really easy to grade (you can't just create random answers -- you have to create answers that seem reasonable + but suffer from having some conceptual mistake.). 

In any case, while paper exams + writing code is less then ideal, it's hard to come up with a good alternative:

1. If you let students write their code on a computer, it's very easy to cheat + collaborate. 
2. You _could_ try and find a computer lab somewhere on campus where internet is disabled and have your students do everything there, but I seriously doubt such place exists.
3. If you try giving a students a take-home exam, or a long, extended assignment, same thing. Students cheat. And even if the vast majority of your students are trustworthy, there's always going to be that one person who puts their HW assignments on Github to show potential interviewers. This means that you either need to come up new assignments each time or keep tweaking them. Writing new assignments is _hard_, grading them is _harder_, and there's only so much tweaking you can do before you start repeating yourself. In addition to writing an assignment, you have to keep them ""balanced"" -- try and anticipate potential pitfalls, and figure out if they're pitfalls you want the students to encounter and solve, or if you need to smooth that part of the curve out. For that reason, it usually takes 2-3 quarters before a new assignment can be adequately balanced. In comparison, writing good exam questions is _much_ easier.
4. For better or worse, many tech interviewers will ask you to code either on paper or on a whiteboard. We would be failing to do our jobs properly if didn't prepare you for that, at least in some way.

> For example , something wasn't right in the definition of a function i did for a problem ,and they told me they didn't even look past it, they just gave it a 0.

It teaches you to be detail-oriented, and to be careful. I would view this as a good thing -- if you're working on software for rocket ships or for heart monitors, having a cavalier attitude towards code and correctness is fatal. ";;
Thanks for taking the time to write such a detailed answer to my question. I think i understand their approach a bit better now.;;
"Hey,
I think coding on a piece of paper is really stupid especially in the beginning, because I think it is ok to make minor mistakes like forgetting an "";"" (in C++ very often) but as soon as you Compile the program and get an error you'll find the error very quickly. Some Professors of mine are complaining about how they had to do it in their studying time and so they don't let us program on paper.

But I think it is ok to print a code and ask for the result, cause you have to understand the code pretty well to know what's happening and you will have to analyse code in future as well.";;
"I don't really know if I like writing code on paper, at least I am sure I don't like it if the syntax has to be correct, too. Programming isn't about knowing syntax by heart, if you're not sure about syntax, parameters or something like that, then every modern IDE will help you with that or you just google more complicated things.

Pseudo code and flow charts are better things to do on paper, they will show if you get the basic idea and if you have a plan how you want to solve the problem.

But in general I am not sure if there really is a good way to test the advancement of someone in that area. ";;
There is a lot of value in knowing the functions (parameters, return values and gist of the general workings) off the top of your head.  Quickly accessible information allows you to have deeper levels of thought about more complicated problems since you wouldn't have to stop and look at the documentation.  If this was your professor's intention, then I think getting a function definition incorrect warrants a 0 since you would essentially need to stop and look at the documentation to correct your mistake.;;

Well, yes. X11 is the graphical window environment used on Unix-like operating systems. Were you intending to do this in the text console?

Sorry, no. I kind of doubt there will be a lot of libraries that provide some sort of abstraction on these parts of the APIs, since it's not something typical application programs need to use.

The way I'd go about thinking of this is as follows:


First thing you'll need is a random number generator of sorts, you want it to generate numbers between a certain range.


So now your program can generate numbers, now you have to convert them. I'm not sure of the language you want to work in, but in C++ the data type `char` will allow you to transform the numbers into ascii characters. And that is what you have to look up next, what is the interval of ascii characters that you want to add.


So now you have something that looks like `asfasaisdjafoFHNAKFBAhGSfhkasbhkfagsfhkasgfkSGBHKAFg`, but that is only letters, if you want to add numbers I suggest you play around with random number generation(if 1 then letter if 0 then number, maybe?).";;

"If you look at the very top of many programs, you'll see a bunch of #include<something>.  These are header files.  The #include portion is a marker for your compiler to add a whole bunch of code there, generally to define some cool functions for you to use and whatnot.  For example #include <iostream> is a common one for beginners and stands for input output stream. This allows use of the cout and cin functions that let you write to the console or read from the console.

So the way you add a header file is #include <filename>  and much of the time these files have the header extension (.h)

"- add new file to the project, name it `std_lib_facilities.h`

"A way to think of header files for now is as an extension of the code. I reckon the tutorial you're following also requires you to create a new .cpp so I will explain given that specification.


You include them by saying #include <nameOfHeader.h>


Basically what happens when you include a header file is that everything inside that header is copied inside of the .cpp file your include it in. Given that generally in header files you have declaration of functions, what this means is that, when you include it in a file, it will tell that file that somewhere, some functions are defined (basically it says that they exist), so if you access any of those functions from, for example, your main. It will go search through all the .cpp files that have included the header to look for what the function actually does.


Consider the following:


Main


    #include <iostream>
    #include <header.h>
    int main()
    {
     int x=5;
     function(x);
     return 0;
     }


Header


    #pragma once    //This is a bit more complex but suffice to say for now that you need it in every .h file that you have
    void function(int u);


Other .cpp file


     #include <iostream>
     #include <header.h>
     void function(int u)

      std::cout<<""This is from a different file!"" << std::endl;

Some guidance:

Conway's Game of Life uses a grid where the left and right borders as well as the top and bottom borders are joined together. In geometrical terms, the grid of the Game of Life is a *Torus* (a donut).

So, you need to find a way to access the respectively opposite ends of your grid.

I'd use `board[0].length` to get the length of the second dimension. (Doesn'y really matter if the grid is square, but would matter for a rectangular grid where height!=width.)

Now, you just have to use these methods inside the nested loop and your ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception should be gone.";;

How do you test any code? Write some test cases, and spend some time thinking of any potential edge cases/quirks/flaws. Compare and contrast what you expect your container to do (what you want your interface/contract/specification to be) against the actual behavior. 

And if you _don't_ know what the interface/contract/specification is (things like pre-conditions, post-conditions, expected input, output, behavior, etc...), take a 10-15 minutes and hash it out.";;

Thanks, it worked! :);;
The ToC looks good.  You can pick of Java 8 things later.  People have made plenty of programs with Java 1 - 7.;;
I have no idea about the content, but using Java 7 is fine. [It is not a whole lot different than 8](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/193630/summary-of-differences-between-java-versions). All the code should still be relevant.;;
It's totally fine. I read a book featuring Java 6 a while back and I'm using Java 8 now and everything works.;;
"Should be fine.  Especially for non-advanced Java, anything Java 5 or later is okay.

Java 5 introduced major syntactical changes, including the addition of generics, enhanced for (""foreach"") loops, enums, among other things.";;
"If you look at the way you derived the path above, there is another pattern in the adjacency list that is a little different from the one you took a screenshot of.

Let's stay the starting point is 1. Start at A(1,1) and move down the row until you hit a 1 in the adjacency table, in this case at A(1,4). Now, instead of moving down the column, move to the 4th row: A(4,1). Repeat the process until you come to the first 1 in the 4th row: A(4, 5). Repeat for the 5th row, and the first 1 you get is A(5,4) - but you've already been to 4, so you can reject this and move on to the next 1: A(5, 6)

Do you see the pattern here? Move to the current position's row, search for a 1 in the row in the adjacency list, if that position has already been visited, move to the next 1, if that spot has not been visited, it becomes the current position, move to the start of the current position's row...(repeat)...

This isn't a complete solution, but I hope it gets the gears turning.

EDIT: Tried to rephrase a few things for clarity.";;
"I think I understand.

* Begin at A(1,1), go down to A(1,4)
* Row 1 of A is now not traversable
* Begin at A(4,1), go down to A(4,5)
* Row 4 of A is now not traversable
* Begin at A(5,1)
* since Row 4 is not traversable, ignore the 1 at A(5,4)
* go down to A(5,6)
* and so on

After each traversal down a column, keep some record (perhaps a boolean[] array) of already indexed rows. Ignore attempts to land on an already indexed row.

[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/UiHMRNd.png)

Red is the path to the next node, blue indicates a non-traversable row. This is all four steps of the solution.

* 1 -> 4
* 4 -> 5
* 5 -> 4 (skip) -> 6
* 6 -> 3";;
Right! Good start. Now with this small maze that algorithm might work outright. But if you had a larger maze with more open spaces, there might exist a spot that could be traversable in more than one way, so you'd have to double back and check the other  possible paths if one path failed. Just typing this I know that probably sounds confusing so let me know if that doesn't make sense. The point is you are on the right track. Great work. ;;
I'm curious how your original solution works if it's not generic enough that it can easily be made to work with any graph implementation.  2d array or adjacency matrix both tell you if you can go directly from one room to another room...;;
"You will need a way to color each node, like:  
White - Unexplored        - 1  
Gray - Already Explored  - 2  
Black - No Path Way - or already explored fully  - 0  
  
Just look up some Pseudo code, or think of a way.  
Most times you visit the node change the color, and see what you can explore:  
Bread First usually uses a Queue.  
Depth First usually uses a Stack (Best done recursively).  
  
Well here is the Pseudo Code for the BFS:  
  
    BFS( G ): (Note: G – Graph | N - # of nodes | M - # of edges)	O(N + M)

But I urge you to see that it doesn't matter if you are using the char array or the adjacency matrix. The essence of shortest path is figuring out how you answer ""Can I walk here?"".

Now I don't actually know whether this guarantees the shortest path (but if yours works then this works). If you aren't allowed to allocate another array then you can actually use the diagonal of the adjacency matrix instead of a new mn x 1 array.";;
"Mine does not work. It finds a path, but not the shortest path (small steps, right?). I find for smaller mazes, the path it finds coincidentally is the smallest, but for giant ones no dice.

The method I have as well as the one you've posted receives initial position as an argument. In my char array BFS algorithm, I've hardcoded the initial position by looking at the maze, but having it dynamic (ie. not defined, but found by the program) is proving difficult. I have a good idea of how to use Dijkstra's algorithm, but it still needs a *seed* node in which to begin. I'm not too sure how to deduce the start point dynamically by looking at an adjacency matrix.";;
I would assume you are given the seed node in the adjacency matrix;;
"The adjacency matrix is mapping adjacency between nodes. It's not a map of nodes themselves.

edit; sorry, I'm just really lost when it comes to graphs. Lets name the adjacency matrix *adj*. In the maze below:

    S X E
    O O O
    O X X

Would *adj(1,1)* be considered the start point, and *adj(3,3)* considered the end point? I'm assuming the diagonals are important here.";;
"The adjacency matrix you have in the OP is correct

There is the mapping:

(1,1) -> 1

(1,2) -> 2

(1,3) -> 3

...

The start point is just the number 1. The end point is the number 3.

The diagonals in an adjacency matrix are unimportant (since you should never want to know whether you can walk from a point itself)";;
"This is the crux of what I don't quite understand. Taking *adj(1,1)* as the start point means I am indexing a vertex with no significance. I am referring to the below psuedocode for a shortest path traversal in an unweighted adjacency matrix:

    void unweighted( Vertex s ) {
        for each Vertex v {
            v.known = false;
        }
        s.dist = 0;
        for( int currDist = 0; currDist < NUM_VERTICES; currDist++ ) {
            for each Vertex v {
                if( !v.known && v.dist == currDist ) {
                    v.known = true;
                    for each Vertex w adjacent to v {
                        if( w.dist == INF ) {
                            w.dist = currDist + 1;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

In my specific code, the adjacency matrix is in the form of Vertex[][] with .dist initialized as INF for each and .known as false.

For the below maze:

    S X E
    O O O 
    O X X

Doing the above pseudocode for *adj(1,1)* will yield a distance map of:

    0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
    ...
    adj(i,j).dist == i+j

Since I will be checking *adj(1,1)* and its adjacent vertices and their adjacent vertices and so on. Either this algorithm or starting at *adj(1,1)* doesn't seem useful for solving a maze.

Is my understanding of adjacency matrices flawed? I'll admit I don't have much to work on. Most online resources for shortest path algorithms don't care for endpoints or anything, really, it just finds the distance from a vertex to all other vertices, not necessarily a starting vertex and an ending vertex.

I must apologize if you're trying your hardest to explain and I just don't get it. The course's online slides have literally nothing on how to create an adjacency matrix and literally nothing on mazes. The textbook isn't of much help, either.

You can see what I'm working with [here](http://www.cosc.brocku.ca/~efoxwell/2P03/assign4/assignment4.pdf). I've pretty much given up on solving a 3D maze, so I'm trying to at least get 2D mazes down (and perhaps for a 3D maze will come to me as I go along). The part that is tripping me up is:

* knowing where to begin and end in the adjacency matrix (my assumption is that since the adjacency matrix is not a map of nodes but a map of adjacencies between nodes, the start- and end-points are not defined in the adjacency matrix)
* traversing the adjacency matrix (just traversal, not even finding a solution)";;

I want to understand where to start and would like help no need to be rude;;
Why not just use team viewer, or RDP? You could do it in Python multiple ways, just depends how familiar you are with the language. You could create a python web page that has a link that you click causing a command to run which could then click the skip song button. ;;
Because I want multiple people to be able to use it but I don't know where to start. Where do I get info about making a python web page? Also do you know how to create a command that would run the command to skip the button. I know spotify has an API I could use for my code.;;
[deleted];;
"Spotify desktop
and windows 8.1
Thanks btw

I had the idea of running a command that would just execute a autohotkey or even a jitbit macro that clicks the skip button. All I'd need then is a batch file to execute that runs the macro over the network";;
"You could use python to run an http server on the music bot computer and then expose a web page which allows you submit the commands. Then when you get a command you could link it up to Spotify by running your tinytask or whatever (as you mentioned in another comment).

Another option is to speak to Spotify directly via their [web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/code-examples/). They even have an [example that uses voice recognition](http://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/p30pb38z/), and if you could use some sort of audio mixer software to feed the voice audio from raidcall back into it you might even be able to just control it directly by voice commands like ""spotify next"".

The approach I would probably take (since you can't interact very well with the spotify app directly) would be to use something like [CEF](https://code.google.com/p/cefpython/wiki/API) or [Webkit](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtwebkit-index.html) to create an application which embeds a browser on one end playing Spotify via the aforementioned web API, and then a web or socket server on the other end to listen for remote commands. Then when you get a command, instead of blindly clicking on the screen you can call JS methods to trigger the web API and precisely execute the command you want.

That said, this method is much more complicated than executing pre-canned actions on the Spotify UI.

None of this really gets you any closer to actually solving it, but I don't think you're going to have anyone actually do this for you (at least not for effectively nothing).";;
I can use twitch chat api which is what I started to do.;;
Use mpd server, then mpd clients can control the music.  It's already been done, see this: https://www.mopidy.com/;;
"I've done something similar.

* Set up an AHK script on the client that knows how to click the ""skip"" button 
* Run a program in any language to check if the internet is slowing down. If so, run the AHK script 
* DDoS the music bot every time you want to skip ";;
That's so creative I actually laughed;;
"couldnt you just write a programm on the spotify host computer that moves the mouse to the skip song button on the spotify programm and left clicks when recieving a message via a network

then you set up a simple network programm with client and server
the host pc is the sever and only lets other computers connect and recieve messages, then you programm a second programm, the client which you than can run on any pc, just connect with the server (via id input) and make a button which sends a message to the server . server recieves message moves the mouse autoclicks and refocuses the client again.

Hope you a understood what i tried to explain ^^´";;
"yea this is what I'm trying to do. Looking into a lot of stuff now
";;
should be quite easy i think, wish you a lot of luck mate;;
"Frontend, backend or full-stack?

Either way, you will probably end up having to use JavaScript at some point. If you're comfortable with Visual Studio, C#/ASP is pretty fully featured - there isn't really a C++ equivalent.";;
I'd read the Django docs and see how far you get with that.  It's ORM makes it trivial to get your models and database tables up and running.  You can later whine about how the ORM is only 6 sigmas as flexible as you need it to be, and put in your own custom queries easily.;;

"> Symmetric at best will take some cracking to extract the key from the app binary, and at worst, will be right there in full view in ascii in the web page source.

Just because assymetric crypto uses 2 keypairs doesn't make it any different in this regard: just like you don't want the key to be exposed in symmetric crypto you don't want to expose your private key. 

In his case he can easily keep the key secret since it's not a public website that does the encryption.

People then say, ""well salt it"", well, the salt will need to be in sync with the server so it'll be passed in plain ascii... rainbow tables

You're mentioning a nice bunch of keywords but you're not really saying anything. Your mention of salting for MD5 passwords (seriously, who even uses MD5 nowadays?) is not relevant in this regard because salting is done purely server-side (you use a per-password salt to prevent against rainbow tables) and he's doing direct HTTP communication over SSL so there's no point in hashing a password in the first place: if they can get to the plain text it's not like a hash will be an issue for them.";;

I think of higher level things, like use cases.  Who is going to do what with the program?;;
"Planning can be broken into several steps.

First you need to figure out exactly what you need to do. What are the goals of what you're building? What are the requirements and constraints of what you're building? These are measurable so that you can assess how well you met these goals. For example, if you were to build a new bug tracking web site a goal might be that it needs to support 10 requests per second or that it can perform queries that might return 1000 bugs in less than 2 seconds, etc. These goals form the foundation to help you decide how to build the web site.

The next step is to create a high level picture of how you are going to meet these goals. Will you need a database? Which one? Is Sqlite enough to meet your scenarios? Will you need something more powerful? What front end and back end frameworks fit best for this problem? What are the major components of the design and how will they interact with each other? How will data flow through the system? During this step you may need to prototype in order to verify that the design can meet the goals.

Next you should dig deeper into each of the major components and ask the same questions for each, breaking the problem down further until you have a good idea of what objects you will need, what methods those objects will have, and how those methods will be implemented.

The plan you create should be specific and detailed enough that if you were to give it to someone unfamiliar with what you're trying to do they could successfully implement the feature.

It is a lot of work and it takes practice to get there, just like coding, but planning is the most important part of the product cycle. If your plans are good and complete they will help you find bugs and problems before you ever even code them and they serve as documentation that new developers can use to get up to speed in the code base.";;
"The very first thing I do is to find possible problematic areas, and possible solutions for them. I often build prototypes, knowing that those will be deleted, so they don't have to be well-designed or well-tested etc. They exist only to try out solutions for those problematic areas. Shouldn't take more than an hour.

After I found solutions I write them down, delete everything and start over from scratch. Often by doing UX flowcharts. ""The user does this, then the user sees that, and clicks there..."" That will give an outline on what views are needed, and also what models (i.e. a shopping cart containing a set of mixed products with different quantities). Then the controllers are just the needed boilerplate.

Key is to not do too much at once. In the world of agile development, the first sprint phase is often just a week, the second and third may be 2 weeks. Sprint phases consist of a whole development process (requirement -> experimentation -> planning -> solution -> presentation -> release) with only very few core features. A program has to be designed to allow growth in very small steps using design patterns such as dependency injection for example. It must not degrade in code quality. It must stay green on automated tests.";;
"The main reason is that JavaScript is the only language that will run directly in your web browser. As a result, you basically _have_ to learn it out of sheer necessity if you want to do web development. In contrast, PHP is just one out of many languages you can use on the backend. I would also argue that it's not really an either-or sort of thing -- it would be valuable to learn both languages.
";;
If I learned JS & NodeJS, could it potentially eliminate any PHP that may have been planned in present of future projects? Therefor passing String's etc simpler.. ;;
"It might make it a little simpler, but not by much. There _are_ some advanced frameworks and libraries that take advantage of how you have the same programming language running in both the backend and frontend, but those are fairly advancedot things you'll probably be working with in the short term.

In any case, if you plan on programming as a career, you should avoid over-specializing in a single programming language + make sure to be familiar with a wide variety of languages. 

Each language is a tool in your toolbelt. You'll find situations where Node.js is more appropriate, and other situations where PHP is more appropriate. The more languages you know, the more situations in general you'll be able to handle.

Again, it's not an either-or sort of thing. You should try and learn both.";;
Can you describe what you mean by 'passing Strings' and how exactly you imagine Javascript would make that easier?;;
There is asm.js and in a few years there will be WebAssembly.;;
When you say JavaScript, are you talking about NODEJS? ;;
"I understand NodeJS is part of Javascript and I have looked into it, however goes over my head at this point in time, but I meant JS as a whole in comparison.

EDIT : Under the impression NodeJS the backend section of Javascript?
Sorry still a little noob in some area's.";;
"It would be more correct to say that JavaScript is a part of Node, rather than the other way around. Node.js is a way of running web applications (almost) entirely in JavaScript. You can use Node to spin up a web server and then serve web pages with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, and do it in a way that can be, under some circumstances, very efficient and scalable. Node can also be extended with [addons](https:/odejs.org/api/addons.html), where you would write C++ DLLs that can interact with some API and then wrap up that interaction (or the data that results from that interaction) in JavaScript and then work with it in a web page.

Node can be kind of cool, and it can also be a lot to take in. I'm not going to say that you shouldn't work with it or anything, just that you should be prepared to learn a whole lot.";;

Thank you for responding, and clarifying. I (it was a lesson file, so already named) named the first one container.html and the second one is named script.txt It was originally named script.js I changed it to .txt (and changed the .html file to reference the renamed file) because the instructor said something about how a file could be hidden and named script.js.txt and mess up the program. Was trying to troubleshoot. 

I also tried turning off ghostery in my firefox.

Thank you very much.
";;
It should be named script.js. Your browser won't know it's a javascript file unless it has the .js extension. Rename the file, then change your reference back. ;;
"Just did, still no luck. 

Something that could possibly be an alert window pops up next to my search bar at the top of my browser when I open the .html file. It comes up very fast, like .1sec fast; and I can't see what/if it says anything or click on it.

";;
"Hmm, it looks like there are three errors -- one is a miscommunication, one is subtle, and one is a typo.

First, I think you misunderstood what the instructor might have been talking about in regards to the file extension -- it _does_ need to be `script.js`. If you do `script.txt`, the web browser won't recognize the file as a JavaScript file + won't try and run it. 

What your instructor was probably meant was that you need to be careful when saving your file + make sure they have the right extensions. Some text editors (for example, the 'Notepad' program on Windows) will default to always adding the `.txt` extension to the end of your file, no matter what you try and name it. 

The solution to this problem is to either manually rename the file, or use a better text editor that doesn't automatically tack on the wrong extension.

Given that you've already successfully changed your extensions, it seems like this isn't an issue for you + you've already figured out how to get your text editor working correctly.

The second issue is subtle -- take a look at line 7 in your HTML file:

    <script src=""script.txt”></script>

In particular, take a look at that last quotation mark. The first one is the regular straight quotation mark, and the second is a curly/slanted one. They should both be straight -- delete the second quotation mark, and re-type it.

(You get the second, fancier quotation mark when you either copy-and-paste it from somewhere, or if you're writing something in a program like Microsoft Word. Document editors such as MS Word will often do things like replacing regular quotes with fancier curly quotes to make the text look fancier/typographically nicer. Text editors such as Notepad++ or Sublime Text will not attempt to make your text fancier + will write down literally what you tell it to).

Now, the final error is a typo. But first, fix those two errors in your HTML file, and reload the page. Your script won't work (because we haven't fixed the typo yet), but thankfully Firefox (and every other modern browser) will let you view error messages to make it easier to pinpoint what the problem is.

More specifically, what we want to do is bring up the _web console_. On Firefox, the shortcut is Ctrl+Shift+K. There should be two errors -- the first one states what your errors is. (The second one will say something about 'character encoding' -- you should ignore that for now). 

Take a look at what the first error is telling you, and try and identify what the problem might be in your `script.js` file.";;
"When I tried to change the quotation mark, it returned the same curly one. I think that is because I edited the original lesson file, provided by lynda (which has the straight quote and mine is curly), to change the file extension, and also changed the quotation mark. Which made the second one different, and when I tried to change, it just kept it the way I typed it the first time. So I changed the first half of the quotation to match. I am doing all of this editing in mac TextEdit. 

The updated code is below. My file extension is now .js

http://pastebin.com/gksGvG7Z ---new html

I changed the script to something more simple to (hopefully) get rid of the error. I am very inexperienced, and am having trouble figuring about the web console, but I will figure that. I'm not trying to take the easy way or not learn on my own the way you suggested. I'm just trying to take as many variables out as possible, I think there's some underlying problem with the way I'm trying to this. I took a screen video to show you the 'popup,' I'm waiting on vimeo to convert (approx 30 minutes).

Edit: Ah, ok. I figured out the web console. It's highlighted the reference to script.js in red; and has a bunch of symbols like when you convert a word document to textfile. I think that means I've got a problem in preferences in TextEdit?
";;
"> I am doing all of this editing in mac TextEdit. 

Ah, that would be the problem. The Mac TextEdit is a _document editor_, similar to Microsoft Word, and not a _text editor_.

Try downloading a text editor, and trying again. One good one I recommend is [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) -- you can use the free trial version indefinitely. (It'll bother you from time to time about upgrading, but you can always dismiss the prompt).

Now, because you were using a document editor instead of a text editor, several of the assumptions I was making in my earlier post was incorrect -- in particular, the error messages you're seeing are different then the ones I'm seeing (which probably explains why you're confused).

Once you open the .html and .js files using Sublime Text, you will probably see a bunch of extra text that you didn't put there (assuming I'm remembering how TextEdit works correctly). That's all metadata that TextEdit put there (and that's why Firefox couldn't run your code -- it doesn't understand all of that extra junk).

Either delete those lines of extra text, or delete your files entirely and write in your code again, fixing the curly brackets. 

Give that a shot, and let me know what happens.";;
g2g. Wow. I have no idea why the instructor said to use TextEdit--the first lesson was about the difference bt doc and text editors and how formatting will through it all off. Sorry about how absurdly complicated that was. And thanks again. ;;

Hmm. Well, by 'TextEditor', your instructor might not have been referring to a specific product, but might have been referring to a general 'text editor'.

"I have no clue what the plot of Silicon Valley is, or who those characters are, but to answer your broader question, learning about how technology works is a two-fold process. 

First, you should work through the tutorial, work on projects, and generally spend a good chunk of time just coding. You'll inevitably run into many different issues and bugs and will have to do a bunch of googling and researching to work past those problems. With enough coding and struggling, you'll start to build up an intuitive sense of how coding works. 

Second, once you get a good grasp on programming + complete a few projects, you should start doing a lot of reading. Go on to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com), pick a tag (such as the JavaScript tag), sort by votes, then just browse the top questions and answers. Explore any tags that look interested/look at the list of related questions. You'll probably have to do a lot of googling to understand new terms and concepts, and you may have to skip some questions/answers entirely if they're above your level of comprehension, but I found that this process is a good way to ""learn about what you don't know"". 

I would also try reading news aggregate websites like /r/programming and [Hacker News](https:/ews.ycombinator.com/). Again, you probably won't understand most of it, but will start absorbing more and more info over time.

In both cases, you're going to have to do a bunch of reading and googling -- answers typically don't just come to you; you have to go out and get them. For example, take the terms you listed (burn rate, architecture, etc). If you're curious as to what they are, go and google them.

As you read work through projects/read through articles, you'll eventually start picking up the intuitive understanding that you're looking for. However, do keep in mind that acquiring this understanding won't come instantly -- it does take time. ";;

>The Nginx server acts as a load balancer for when there are multiple application servers. Would there ever be more than one Nginx server for a website? 

For big websites, absolutely. They will be many web servers, and in front if them sits a dedicated Loadbalancer that directs the traffic to each of them. 


>If the Nginx server is redirecting the users to different application servers, how does a user's login data persist?

There are two ways of doing this. You could make the connections sticky, so that the same user will always go to the same application server. The better way is to store the session info in the database, so that multiple app servers can handle the same user. That also allows you to migrate the session when one server crashes. 

> How does the database work in this kind of setup? Does each application server have it's own database that gets synced with each other database?  

Typically there is a shared database. If the workload gets too big for one server it gets complicated. You could shard the database, have read replicas, use noSQL or use a caching layer like memcached.

But a single database should go pretty far. So I wouldn't worry about that. 
";;
"> The better way is to store the session info in the database, so that multiple app servers can handle the same user.

And the best way is to make the application stateless ;) ";;
"To scale horizontally, your requests must be stateless.

This means that everything the server needs to fulfill the client's request is included in the request. For confidential information like passwords and login info, you should instead use a token (like a uuid) which can be used look up in a database.

The database (or maybe a db caching layer) is the only shared state that your application can depend on. Your client can't guarantee that two adjacent requests will go to the same handler. ";;
"C and C++ are not so widely used in ""the real world""  for writing GUI applications - languages like C# and Java tend to be used in business for this purpose.

">  I can still use C++ like C# right ? 

Well, you can use C++/CLI, which is not really C++. But people mostly don't - C# is far more convenient to use, and the tooling is much better.

> Also let's say I start using C# how I can write a real programs with GUI like a simple Bittorrent client or any useful program.

The same way you write any program. This is not a meaningful question. To get started with C#, download the free Visual Studio Community edition and create a GUI project.
";;
"If you want to develop GUI apps in C/C++, you'll need to use a library for it, because such functionality isn't included in the C++ standard library (though I might be wrong about C++ because I mostly use C -it's definitely not in the C standard library). You can create GUI applications using the Windows API directly if you don't want any additional dependencies, but if you do that your application won't be portable to other systems. 

I use [GTK](http://www.gtk.org/) for writing GUI applications; other options include [QT](http://www.qt.io/) and [WXWidgets](http://wxwidgets.org/).

And command line programs are not ""irrelevant to the real world"". Most compilers are command line tools, as are things like git and emacs. Command line tools can be very powerful - and some types of programs are most naturally implemented as a command line tool.

"Are you not using routing?

You should - it's a critical part of angular / MV*

Use [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router)

The readme on the github page shows installation and setup - [this wiki page](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki/URL-Routing) shows how to use parameters

Basically you want your channel defined as a url paramater (eg, channelId) which you can then access from your controller by injecting $stateParams as a dependency, then get the id using $stateParams.channelId

This would let you load the data from individual JSON files, eg, /data/channel1.json using something like

    $http.get('/data/channel' + $stateParams.channelId + '.json')
    .success(function(res) {
        $scope.data = res;
    })";;
Thanks Ill be sure to read through the wiki. I am routing, but didnt look into it very deeply.;;
Make sure it's the correct wiki - there are multiple routers and if you're not using ui-router those instructions won't work.  You might be using [ngRoute](https://docs.angularjs.org/apigRoute) or [Angular Router](https://github.com/angular/router);;

As you said,

>Give each letter a value (a = 0, b = 1...)

you can use a dictionary to do exactly that (see the `alph` dict above). For your `what()` function, you can do some dictionary work with `keys()` and `values()` to figure that out :)";;

"I remember this being reasonably simple, but maybe my dll was a special case:

* Recall that DLLs are loaded at runtime. You don't need to add it as a reference.
* Create a C# managed [wrapper class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa288468.aspx) to interface the types or functions you want to import. Remember that bytes and sizes matter, so your definition needs to match the memory layout.
* Tag your wrapper class with the [DllImport](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.runtime.interopservices.dllimportattribute.aspx) attribute so that the CLR knows what name from your C++ DLL to import.
When you run your application, the first call to the wrapper constructor will search for the DLL in the local directory.
* Now your type is managed, and any problems in it will become exceptions. The DLL could still leak resources though, so make sure you clean up in your wrapper class's destructor.";;
"there's not really a great way.

there's a clr category under visual c++ for me in vs2013. you can just make a class library and wrap everything to access it in c#. this is a lot of busy work as you have to wrap/expose everything you want to use on the c# side.

if you only need access to a few methods or something, you can just expose them via standard p/invoke means.

Anything higher than that becomes a 1st, 2nd, and 3rd e.g. 21st, 31st, 22nd, 32nd, etc. So you could add checks to see if the numerals in the tens' and ones' places match these three unusual numbers. Keep in mind, you can't just check for 11, 12, and 13, because when you reach another hundreds place, you need to implement the suffix for 111, 112, 113, 211, 212, 213, and so on and so forth.

EDIT 2: After playing with some code myself (thanks for the cool problem to tinker with!), I think the best way is to extract the tens' place digit and the ones' place digit.

In my experience, buying a very simple book is the best way to start.  Jon Duckett's books or any ""The Missing Manual"" book are good places to start.";;
Have you seen the MDN? It's not just a reference. It also has [a number of tutorials and guides](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn). And it's a wiki, so if you think an explanation is bad or wrong, you can change it.;;

+1 for Jon Duckett, those are great books;;

"Oh of course do tutorials, it's there in the third bullet. You HAVE to put in the time to learn the basics, absolutely.

~~edit: wtf? I'm agreeing.~~";;
"I also disagree but think a better way to go is to learn the concepts first: What are loops and conditionals anyway? What are variables? What is a function? How do you combine these things to form a logical program flow? Use pseudocode and draw it out.

Then apply the concepts by learning a language (if you already know the concepts when you learn your first language, you'll only have one thing to stumble over -- the syntax -- instead of stumbling over both the syntax and the concepts simultaneously).

Then apply them in another language, and you'll start to see the similarities and differences between languages. 

Then build something small but real from scratch in whichever language you liked best. This is the hardest part, but you should be able to do it with a lot of research and asking for help when you need it. 

After you do that, learn the APIs and libraries that are popular in your language of choice and build something bigger. ";;

I agree with you. Treehouse and Lynda and other sites are such good resources to start out. Yeah, you sometimes do need to figure stuff out for yourself, but when you're just starting out, it's essential to not overwhelm yourself.;;
"I'm really new to programming, but I think you should go even more basic than that. I think most people would start with basic programming logic, definitions and processes and what they mean. Syntax be damned until you understand those things.

I couldn't get my head around any language and what I could do until I understood the lingo, and the process of creating a program and why it's done the way it is.

But that could be my ingrained and overwhelming need to know ""why"" in every facet of life.";;
Agreed, it's easy looking back and saying just dive in head first when you are already swimming about in the pool...;;
Yeah but the problem with that is a lack of good tutorials on programming.;;
Whats wrong with what's provided?;;
yeah, isn't codecademy the best lead-in to JS? Like, it isn't the end all, but at least you'll leave the program with some rudimentary knowledge. ;;
It will also cement poor programming habits, rather then enable you to fix them.;;
Also don't start with Javascript, it's pretty much universally considered to be a badly designed language, it can teach the beginner some really bad practices if your sources are shitty.;;
"I agree and disagree because it depends too much on the person and the background.

For me when I started learning programming I was already adept in math and science so for me going through a step by step programming tutorial was painfully slow because it covered too much of what I already knew when it came to math and things that are similar to math constructs such as arrays already made sense to me.  It was much better to just have a set of resources where I could look at a basic example, look up the commands, and just start knocking it out.  I learned about exceptions and things like optimization as I went. 

Now I'm an exception because I came in with a background that was suited for programming.  For people who come in with a weaker background a step by step tutorial might be perfect for them because they need to learn the underlying concepts in order to actually fully grasp what is going on.

So IMO it isn't a one size fits all solution.  ";;
"Why JavaScript?

I'm someone who has studied cs and have always wondered how a front end language for web development represents cs.

Isn't computer science based on structure, organization and understanding of software and computers in terms of binary etc?";;
"My favorite thing about programming is the creativity. I love making stuff. I recommend JavaScript (along with CSS and HTML as part of a balanced breakfast) because it's the fastest way to start seeing stuff on the screen, customizing it, and having it interact. It's definitely not the most consistent language, but I think it's one of the most fun.

I think CS can be language agnostic. Sure JS might seem weaker because it isn't compiled and has a very loose type system, but hey, we're no longer coding in assembly either! I mean, what can't you teach in JS? It's got recursion, objects, simple-but-effective data structures, and first-class functions for killer functional programming demos!

Would I teach a college programming course with it? Probably not. It's too loose, too fun. At some point the party has to end and it's better to disappoint students up front. But then there's this statistic: 100% of the Fortune 100 tech companies use JavaScript. Wow.";;
100% of the tech companies use Javascript because it has been forced down their throats by our inflexible tech standards. Javascript as a language is awful.  The ES6 update will finally make it bearable. But I absolutely cannot wait until the new webassembly standard is released and JS goes the way of the dodo (if that is even possible for a programming language).;;
"I agree with you on those points because they are true. However, languages in general do not last. Companies get them, manipulate them, and then send em off to another company. Every 3 to 5 years is a different language, a different trend, a different framework.

But just like OP's post, CS people have to learn, adapt, and create with whatever they want to use. It's about the person, not the tool. And while JS is admittingly shit for all the reasons you just stated, it is something that a lot of people like using, and therefore companies will hire people who know it because that's what CS people use.

Eventually JS will die. So will other languages. Maybe even C. But we enjoy what it had to offer while it lasted, remember the times that it gave us interesting problems to solve, and reflect on the projects we worked with it.

I still have old word docs from when I was in elementary school using English for the first time, and I enjoy looking at them and remember what fun times I had while in school.

Isn't that what we do when we create stuff like this? It is our art, and we are its master.";;
"You can't teach a bunch of things, most prominently class-based object orientation, but also logical programming, pointers, memory structure, etc, which are admittedly less practical, but still missing.

Of course I don't think that stuff should be crammed into JS, and I wholeheartedly agree that quick results are a huge factor, and having JS in your tool box is a huge asset.";;
Computer Science is to a coder what Mechanical Engineering is to a mechanic.;;
"CS : coder :: physicist : mechanic

CS : software engineer :: physicist : mechanical engineer";;
"With the advent of V8 and projects such as React Native and asm.js JS as long ceased to be a mere ""front end language"". Also, with a shift to logic-heavy frontends, a lot more engineering is required. Front end development isn't what it used to be.

CS is only partially about programming. Lots of CS related programming topics can be covered in JS though, e.g. it lends itself well to both OO-programming and a functional approach.

Also, it is a great language to get started with because there's just so much you can do with JS these days.";;
Really? I don't know much about JavaScript so I thought I was being quiet ignorant. But if js is used more than just for the fancy ui stuff then fair play.;;
Javascript is a full-on programming language. [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Github's text editor desktop application) was actually written in it, and styled with HTML and CSS. Lots of good stuff to be done with Javascript beyond fancy UI design on the web.;;
Has it been like that from the beginning or has it evolved to become an object oriented language ?;;
"I believe Node.js in 2008 was the first time JS was able to be run outside of the browser, and that kicked off the whole ""JS ALL THE THINGS"" trend we're in now.

IMO it's just a trend, as the language structure and syntax is (IMO) terribad, especially for a first language to learn. It's not a class-based OOP language (it's prototypal and quite a hack-job afterthought of OOP at that), whereas Java, C#, C++, Python, Ruby, and basically every other language you've ever heard of that people use for OOP *is* class-based. The nice thing about learning class-based languages is you can jump between each one and find it relatively easy to transition, since you already know the core design philosophy and structure of how to make stuff. JS is a bit of a rogue in this respect, with only a few other (most of them obscure) languages sharing its design philosophy. Everybody pushes JS right now simply because there was a massive wave of full-stack JS development, so everybody views it as extremely employable - which was/is true - but all trends shift. IMO we're on the downslide of the JS craze. Even the creator of Node thinks its time has passed and things can be better, he's moved on to Golang. WebAssembly is working towards allowing more than JS to work inside the browser, and once that happens, the ""one language for everything!"" theme won't be limited to just JavaScript.

It's great to know, and certainly necessary for web devs, but if you're more interested in applications/back end I really think there are much better paradigms to learn *especially* for beginners. Learn JS and you can get a JS job. Learn a class-based language and you can get the other 90% of jobs.";;
"> I believe Node.js in 2008 was the first time JS was able to be run outside of the browser

Actually, not true. Rhino has been around almost as long as JS itself. Aside from that, JS has also been used as a scripting language in various non-browser contexts throughout the years, such as (according to wikipedia) adobe acrobat, max/msp, etc. I think you can also write windows widgets with JS. Anyway, node.js definitely wasn't the first.";;
You can use JS for scripting in Unity.;;
Abobe had a js API for acrobat reader as well.;;
"> IMO it's just a trend, as the language structure and syntax is (IMO) terribad

Yes, because we know from past experience language quality is a great indicator for future popularity.

\*looks at php\*";;
"I gave other reasons why I believe that. Plus, PHP, although definitely near the bottom of my list, has fixed many of its problems in the past few years.

There are a *ton* of PHP jobs and it's probably the clear #1 language to learn if you want to do freelance webdev jobs on elance, guru, etc but you don't hear anybody these days harping on learning PHP because it isn't trendy anymore. Also, since you can do class-based OOP with it, PHP knowledge transfers better to many more langauges, which was a big part of my point *specific to beginners*. You have to consider the full context of my point, not just one partial snippet of one clause.";;
"I'm not super-familiar with the whole evolution of the language, but my impression is that the main difference between its early days and where it's at currently lies in its applications then vs. now. It's flourished as demand for a more responsive internet, where websites are more and more considered to be legitimate ""apps"", has emerged. There's always a hot new framework coming out, and I feel like that's what continues to drive its popularity. It's basically The Programming Language of the Web.";;
The statement you have written the leads me to ask, is JS good enough for backend development?;;
I think NodeJS is a really popular framework for doing back-end stuff in Javascript. But again, I'm no expert. I know it's possible, and there are frameworks for handling it, though.;;
It actually surprisingly difficult to program (well) in JavaScript because of the asynchronous, event based execution of code.  If you are starting off, you are much better served by learning a scripting language such as Python or Ruby for server side web development. ;;
"While Node is pretty popular it's also pretty low level from my experience. You have to consider a lot yourself.

At least that was the case when I used it, which is a few years ago.";;
Exactly what i was going to ask.. ;;
A pedant would argue that Computer Science and Programming are two different things, true.  But I think the OP's advice applies well to programming.;;
I would agree to programming but not so much the computer science stuff.;;
One answer, nodejs has made it a server side language, and I use it all the time. ;;
"If you don't have a good teacher, you better have a good compiler. I found that the opposite can also be true. I.e. a good teacher and a lax language.

As for learning low level stuff, you can move on to C++ via Node, but even Node itself provides some low level control.";;
Closure. Higher-order functions. Monads.  JavaScript has a lot to teach you. ;;
Yes, because JavaScript programmers just love talking about Monads. /s;;
Douglas Crockford speaks about them at length.;;
"What if you don't know what questions to ask?

For example: I have a problem and I thought of a solution, I guarantee this solution already exists but I don't care as I want to do it for myself. 

I want to make an app that lets me keep a record of numbers everyday and also allows the possibility of making a note for that day. 

I've watched some tutorials and I bought the book Head First into Java. I've spent some time reading it but I can't help psyching myself out. 

I have the idea, I just have no idea the first step to take or the ""right"" questions to ask?";;
"start from the basics. First, make a Java program that will run on your computer (I assumed you meant ""android app""? or just a program?) and save whatever information you need to a plain text file located in the same directory with your java program.     

For that, you will need to learn how to ask for and process user input (both from console and from file), how to write to file, how to handle exceptions, how to validate data (check if the user didn't enter anything stupid). Make a menu - a text menu for now, something like     

   1. Add new record        
   2. Show all records     
   3. Exit      

That will help you learn conditions and loops (for example, keep entering new records until a key word like ""/quit"" is entered).  Also check for correctness - and ask user to repeat if you find an error.   

After that, add the option to save to file. Read about output streams, a PrintWriter class, IOExceptions. Check if the file really gets created and that the records remain there when you quit the program.   

After that, make your program read the records back from file. This is more than enough for a full first-time project, but if you want a challenge, you can add a simple search feature or sorting or something like that.     

Meanwhile, continue with the Head First book and really pay attention to the object oriented concepts, make your code structured, build classes and create objects, instead of just putting everything into String and number variables. Learn how to convert Java objects to text data, and back. For each of those things there's a SO question or a tutorial. If you don't understand something, ask here.    

Once you got your text version working, and feel that you understand at least 80% of Java API reference (what does it mean when something is an abstract class or an interface, what are ""implementing classes"", etc.) you can proceed to try and make a UI for it - be it Android or awt/swing or javafx framework. It's gonna get complicated so you'll need to learn stuff about data structures (Stacks, Queues, Trees, etc.) and threading. Always make sure you understand what you're doing and why. Blindly copy-pasting code, even when it's working, might help you slap together a funcitonal app but ultimately, it all boils down to this Breaking Bad dialog:    
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgjpesYUwJA    

(I always remember this scene when i'm too tired or frustrated and half-assing shit starts looking real tempting :])    

and don't hesitate to ask. Don't worry about phrasing stuff correctly or using the right terms or sounding ""stupid"", just get as much details as possible, nobody's gonna yell or laugh at you here for not understanding, as long as you're making an effort.


";;
Try this. Think of your app as a problem , go through it thoroughly and then divide it into smaller pieces. Start solving it piece by piece. Don't just rush into it. If you're stuck google it. Google is your best friend, but when you find your answer don't just copy/paste. Study it , see how it works ,and if you can try to deviate from it a bit.;;
"I think this part is the tipping point of my apprehension, I've broken it down into smaller problems but now I'm not sure what to google exactly. 

For example, I think I'd start with I want to use Java to input a number and save it. Would I essentially type that into Google? Does my wording even make sense?";;
Even if your question is pretty vague, [Google has your back!](http://imgur.com/2xkuRb0);;
Just try until you find it. Googling things is also a skill that you need to learn. You'll maybe write 10 dumb querys at first but one of them will be good and you'll find your reward there.;;
Dude, I'm just going to come out and say you might need to do some more reading. The pieces you break it down to should make you think 'oh, put that in an array' or 'I can use a switch statement for that' or 'that should be an object and those are the properties'. If this isn't coming to you naturally, that's fine, just means you aren't ready yet.;;
That's a pretty common thing you'd want to do in any programming language. I recommend studying up on the basics of programming first and then try to code your idea. Your Head First book will definitely cover how to do the first part of your program.;;
This is where doing some tutorials is helpful. As you code you'll learn to quickly identify bits and pieces you'll use, making boggling much easier. ;;
"If you don't know what questions to ask, then it means you need to spend more time learning the language fundamentals.

It's good to have an idea, but it's really, really easy to psych yourself out in the beginning by thinking that you can just go right ahead and implement the idea piecemeal right at the start.

In my experience, programming education has largely consisted of two parts:

**1) Learn a language:** this is the part that everyone thinks will be hard, but is actually pretty easy. Once you learn one programming language sufficiently, learning others (assuming the paradigm is the same, like object-oriented, for example) is an absolute snap. Why? Because all languages fundamentally allow you to accomplish the same basic set of computational tasks. They all have looping constructs, conditionals, variables, arithmetic & logic operators, collections, and so on. The only thing that will differ (and usually not by much) is the syntax used to perform these tasks. This step is best approached--in my opinion anyway--through the use of normal ""textbook""-like learning materials. *Head First Java* is as good a starting point at any other.

**2) Learn how to implement things using that language:** typically this means learning a framework or API for a certain platform. With knowledge of Java, you'd have a direct path to Android development, for example. But what this means is learning the frameworks and patterns that allow you to do stuff in Android apps, which is a different (and far broader, really) task than simply learning Java to a sufficient level. So what do you do? What I suggest is that, once you get to this level, the best way to learn is in a tutorial-based manner, where you're learning as you build something. A language can be learned through toy examples that just demonstrate various constructs, but a framework is best learned in a more comprehensive manner, so you can see how everything fits together. So you pick up an Android book that uses a tutorial-based system. Shouldn't be too hard to find. And of course, with Java you have plenty of other options, too. You can start building desktop GUI apps right out of the box if you want using the JavaFX or Swing libraries.

But the thing is, you won't ever make it that far if you're constantly nagging yourself internally about not yet understanding how to make your app into reality. Keep the idea in your head, maybe even write it down on paper and refine it over time. I promise you, if you stick to the process, you will one day begin to develop an understanding of how the app would fit together structurally, how you'd go about solving certain problems, etc. Don't give up just because the solution isn't readily apparent to you after a little bit of reading.";;
"Yes, because 99.99% of the tutorials on the web are just teaching you how to string words together to make a program.

What they don't teach you is how to analyze the problem and break it down into logical steps to be implemented.

Look at your example... just from the short description, you need a program that lets you enter numbers, enter text, is able to store the information, and is able to retrieve the information in some way.

That's 4 basic requirements, and each can be broken down further several times, and then you need to make the decision on _how_ to implement _each_ requirement.

It's only after you answer all of those questions that uou even think about writing code, because without the answers to those questions, how will you even know what you need to write?

";;
Google CRUD app examples and start there. It's what you'll spend 90% of your career writing, and that question is broad enough to lead you down a rabbit hole of tutorials for basic stuff.;;
"I just wanted to say thank you to everyone that responded. I definitely appreciate everyone's thoughts, suggestions and encouragement. 

";;
"> What if you don't know what questions to ask?

This is also a learned art. Somewhere out there is a quote that goes: ""IT is 20% knowing the right phrase to type into google and 80% knowing the right link to click."" 


I don't think Google-fu is your problem, though. You might have set too high of a goal for yourself. It's great that it got you motivated to work, but it also sounds like it's demotivating you. I mean, how can you possibly know if you are able to make that app or not if you don't know how to program yet? A good idea is to pick something that you can already can come up with how to do it but you have never done it before. Always have a plan before you start solving a problem. 

Maybe keep reading and an idea for a cool text adventure or rpg will come to you.";;
"This is just wrong. This is how you learn a new language/lib/api/etc when you already KNOW how to code.

Now, since maybe you are not really answering ""how to learn to code"" you are actually answering ""what is the best way to find out what CS is like?"" So I would modify what you said in this way:

CS IS exactly like what you describe, once you are a seasoned professional.  But learning to be a professional is NOT like that.  NOt at all.  Being a professional in SE is like being a carpenter, you have your tool bag full of tools, and you know how to use those tools to solve build things.  You have a wide enough array of tools that you can build anything.  Once you reach that point, then when you get a new tool, the best way to learn how to use that tool IS to do what you describe.  But it is not the best way to learn how to use all the tools in your toolbag.  

In general this is a problem with self taught coders vs a CS degree. Yes a self taught coder can be a good programmer as long as you stay in his domain.  (s)He can even be an expert in that domain, but there are a lot of things that (s)he'll not be competent at, because they never had to be, unlike someone with a degree.  Self taught goes depth first (which is what you are describing) but a degree based program is a breadth first approach, and is far far better in my opinion. (and I've got more than 30 years in this game and have seen it all)";;
"Its funny.. because i always feel the exact opposite.. so many grads are ""i wasn't taught this"" or they perpetuate the ""someone please teach it to me"" while the people with no particular cs school can just run with it.. as if its intuitive to me...

but then again, i'm just generalized based on my experience :)";;
"If a CS grad is limited by what they were ""taught"" then they went to a shit school, or are just a shit programmer.  A college should teach you the process of learning new things, learning the things that they teach you is far less important.

OTOH, if they are asking a co-worker about something that can be explained in 5 minutes rather than spending days 'figuring it out themselves' then they have done the right thing.";;
"It all depends on the person. I've met plenty of CS grads who spent $40k to not learn a goddamn thing and I've met self-taught IT professionals who were just as dumb. 

I've also met very intelligent, successful IT professionals both with and without a degree. 

People are different, pieces of paper aren't always indicative of experience or intelligence. What a revelation. ";;
"What positive I got from the post is that the best way to learn is through example, through trial and error, and I think that's as true for programming as it is for learning to ride a bike. Nobody learns to ride a bike by talking about it.

Out of curiosity, can you give some examples of how there is a depth first versus breadth first education in self-taught versus degree-seeking programmers?";;
"Something I saw on a forum just the other day:  I have a lot of experience programming, but I don't know how to call things because I've only done php.

Oy vey!";;
good example;;
"I absolutely disagree with this, except on the language recommendation. I always recommend Python. But for learning how to program, I think a tutorial is exactly the way to go.

Most people tend to give up on things they're bad at and stick to things they're good at. This is basic human nature. A person has to want something enough to work through it when it doesn't work; programming is no different. If you find yourself lost and confused at the start, there's not going to be any way for you to keep going, you'll lose interest and desire. That's where the tutorial kicks in. 

A tutorial gives you a bit of knowledge to start, and then you can feel like you're understanding things, like things are starting to click and make sense. You need direction and guidance at the start, for people to explain how things work and tell you what you need to learn. Yes, a tutorial is significantly different from how you will actually be coding in the real world. You won't know things, and you'll spend a ton of time looking online for answers, or trying a dozen different things before something finally works, and sometimes you won't even understand why. But these are the problems of programmers, and when you don't know anything, you're not a programmer.

If you're interested enough in programming and want to learn it enough, these types of scenarios will arise. You'll end up on StackOverflow eventually, everyone does. You don't have to force it, it's natural for all programmers to end up there. You'll also get stuck and get frazzled on your own, you don't have to force yourself to get there.";;
"I'd say a good 50% of what we do professionally is ""figuring it out"". I don't know everything, so everything I do usually begins with a thorough review of Google examples and ideas before figuring out which direction I like.

Basically: just knowing how to code won't make you a good programmer. There are so many critical thinking and evaluation skills that are fundamental to actually doing this stuff. I agree that this advice is probably more mid level than beginner, but I think he's right to a point.

That's why I like to tell people the best way to learn to program is to be a programmer, but of course, that assumes enough base knowledge to land SOME job to get that first year of explosive growth in ability.";;
"I disagreed with his thing as a whole because, like you said, this advice is meant for someone who has some experience coding.

He's not wrong insofar as that's what a programmer will actually do. I do spend a lot of time trying to figure out the best way to do things. A lot of the time I end up on Google or SO trying to find out if someone else has done what I'm trying to do. At my internship I spent a lot of time asking other people questions. It seems normal to me as well. But I'm also an experienced programmer and I know what questions I'm asking and why I'm asking them.

As a new programmer, you're not really going to even know what questions to ask, let alone why you are asking them. That's a very easy way to get turned off of something. If you get stuck and then have to ask questions, but don't even know what questions to ask, there's a problem. When a programmer gets stuck, they can usually at least explain what the problem is. People go to SO to ask questions like how to turn a list into a dictionary in Python, not ""I have no idea what's going on and I just started yesterday"".

As far as secondary skills like critical thinking and evaluation go, those are skills that develop over time as you expose yourself to more situations requiring those skills. You don't really set out to learn them, they're more so skills that, after a few years, you recognize you have.";;
It was really hard for me to get into coding without taking a class for it first;;

also just to clarify for people, I'm saying to just get started and to kind of get your foundation set up.  you don't have to learn exclusively at school, just take a semester or two to just kickstart yourself.  it would only end up being about $600 per semester as well if you do it at a community college, so if you're serious about coding I recommend it, along if the websites everyone is providing such as the one stated above: http://ProgramArcadeGames.com;;

>This is THE BEST way to find out what CS is like

CS != programming. Sorry, just had to say it :p";;
"That's a great link

> CS != programming. Sorry, just had to say it :p

Absolutely correct. My original comment was to someone going to school for CS, but yes, there is a difference.";;
"> CS != programming. Sorry, just had to say it :p

Damn right; Computability and Automata, Discrete Mathematics, Compilers...these classes had some coding in them, but mostly they were about learning how things worked.";;
This is what it took for me. I spent two years on-and-off doing tutorials and reading theory then finally started just making things and now I've got multiple github repos with projects that I work on nearly everyday.;;
I'm doing the codecademy course for python just now and I think it' a better place to start than just flailing around in the dark. You need a base to work on before you just start flailing around so that you know how things like functions work, and dictionaries and how to set out the syntax.;;
Agreed.;;
"Bull.

I'm getting really tired of all the people saying, ""If you want to learn programming, just decide what you want to make and make it! All the things you don't know, find a tutorial!""

I don't know if you guys realize this, but *normal people* do not think like computers. They need to be taught. They need to be taught *slowly* and painstakingly what a variable is, what inheritance means, why in the world there is such a thing as an abstract class if you're never going to make an object of it. Normal people do not think anything close to logically, nor can they self study. They're slow, they're easily misled, they get discouraged easily. If you want normal people to take up coding, you need to be realistic- you need to let them have their hands held at the beginning. You need to have them make a simple loop that could calculate exponents, maybe. You need to explain how to even install Eclipse, let alone how to use it.

I appreciate that lots of programmers are highly independent, are internally motivated, and kill themselves teaching themselves things, but that's not normal and people that are natural programmers are outliers. Don't encourage normal people to simply be like natural programmers - it only sets them up for frustration because they're unable to do what they *think* they should be able to do.";;
"I'm not implying you are wrong here, but serious question. Do you think you can be a successful programmer WITHOUT those skills? I understand going from 0 to 60 is a bit of a different story, but a lot of what we do is ""figuring it out"". Now I'm a little biased as I am completely self taught, and can see this advise being more for someone a bit further along than ""never seen code before "", but I do think it teaches some of those skills in a way that is important.";;
"We're not talking about how to be a ""successful programmer."" We're talking about how to teach others how to program. By definition, the way to teach is not ""Go learn it by yourself because that's what we all do, lolz.""

I've taught for years, and honestly, successful programmers, in my experience, are some of the *worst* teachers I've ever met. Geniuses, but terrible at explaining anything and too focused on encouraging independence. If people didn't need teachers, then they would just self learn. People who are asking for help or are taking a class are, by definition, not the people who are self taught. They're different groups of people and you need to approach them differently. To do otherwise is illogical.";;
"I disagree a little. Mentorship is, in my experience at least, a better route to independent programmers than classes. Half the questions I get from juniors end up with me saying ""I don't know, let's Google it"" and building things organically with them. i suppose my approach is more paired programming than instruction, but I've seen great success in my teams from that approach. Part of that is, IMO, the nature of actually building something we are maintaining.

It helps break people past their fear of changing things (the just add another class instead of modifying existing code people), shows them the exact process I use to review direction, teaches them some Google fu and how to ask the right questions, etc.

Now that's a far cry, admittedly, from, ""just go figure it out"", so you are right probably for a lot of beginners.";;
"I like what you have said. I have always been interested in programming and finally started on the path and am taking some class to get some certs and a degree here starting in the fall. I am so excited to get open to a new world.

And as many others have said - the best way to learn programming is to start programming your own thing. I have started to dabble into it even if it simply replaying some CodeAcademy stuff in my head. But as you said later, I really have focused on the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is my ""breakfast"" and I want to get really comfortable with that. Eventually throw in some Python and hopefully start making some apps. Currently I have the idea to make a crossword app. No clue how to even start it but I am going to try and figure it out!

Good words of encouragement for us newbies! ";;
Sites like codeacademy can be a good place to start if you have no experience, but staying strictly on those sites won't get you very far.;;
no, but I wonder how many people would feel more ownership of what they were doing if they were working on their own text editors in their own dev environment that they setup themselves. That alone might make the next steps easier to take.;;
"They would probably feel a lot more ownership if they started with text editors/IDEs etc right away, no denying in that but the problem is that all that can be a bit overwhelming. Many new people don't have a clue what programming is and some even have lacking general  computer skills. They point with sites like codeacademy is to introduce people to the world of programming, a sort of ""hey this is what programming looks like, it isn't that scary"".

That being said, I understand your point completely and that is the way to go if you really want to learn and get (more) motivated while doing it. ";;
I think this is great for learning syntax, but does nothing for learning computer science or software engineering. For that, you need to study algorithms, data structures, math, etc... Learning the syntax will help you become a hacker or coder, but to be a software engineer (e.g. create complex projects from scratch), some formal training/learning is required.;;
"Depends what you are doing. Algorithms in the sense of having a basic idea on the performance implications of your code structure? Absolutely. Knowing specific algorithms? Only when writing specific types of things (crud apps, for instance, are usually 90% glue code, and its very unlikely you will have to write a b-tree or similar stuff in most problem domains). Math depends heavily on what you are doing too, and for most enterprise jobs you'll be lucky if you need basic algebra or geometry.

That's not to say those aren't good skills to have: they are. But it's a bit disingenuous to imply that those skills are necessary for all, or even the majority, of actual programming positions out there.";;
I'm talking about knowing the benefits/drawbacks of pubsub versus message queue, or knowing when to use recursion, or knowing when normalization is good/bad, etc... These sorts of architectural issues come up any time you start on a large project and without being able to make the proper decision early, you can very easily end up in over your head.;;
Fair enough. If think thats why I usually instead say the best way to learn is to be a programmer. Being in an environment that's more apprenticeship like will grow you 10 times faster than on your own, or in a degree program, is argue, because your skills are grown more organically than theoretically.;;
Agreed. I think the best way to start programming, is to start writing code. Once you get the syntax, then the best way to become a software engineer is apprenticeship paired with formal education.;;
"In going through programming tutorials for the better part of a year, and hearing so much contradictory advice for absolutely every single source of training, it's pretty clear the following constant is true:

For every way to learn a language, with enough searching, you will find almost exactly as many people saying that it's a great source as those who are saying it's a horrible source. Therefore, just pick something and start learning. If you don't like what it's teaching you, choose a different source after you're done with the current one.

I think so many people in programming get so dug in to one way of learning that they think that the way they learned is the only way to learn something, when the truth is that human beings learn things in infinitely diverse ways, and a method that works for one person. 

So, another constant of learning programming is that there is never a canonical ""best way"" to learn. You just have to discover the way that works for you.";;
"That game advice is spot on. I remember when I was learning my first language (C++), and I had just learned loops (for, while), and if checks... I wrote a text-based Blackjack game.

I still have the code to this day, it's terrible, and knows nothing of objects... but dammit it worked!";;

"I think you need both. I've made about 8 games for android and have racked my head over many complicated problems. Lately I've been trying to catch up on web dev and code academy was great. It was clear and covered a lot of ground. But you are right that unless I actually move forward and code with it then It will fade away. 
";;
I think it's most useful that you pick up a project as early on as possible and just learn towards making it happen. Learning with something at the end is easier and you are learning actively, opposed to just typing in code that you semi-understand but don't know where to actually put in a real life application. ;;

"I feel like the initial starting point is different for everyone but you are on point once you have an understanding of the basics. Code code code!

For me, codecademy and lynda videos were great for getting me started. From there I just went into google and the javascript, and jquery reference sites to see what different things did. 

Also, if you are already a designer working with developers, take advantage of that and ask tons of questions.";;
"> It's very easy to know what CS is like and what to expect: Code! Code! Code! Your homework will be code, your tests will include code, and you most of what you will be learning is how to code better. The best way to prepare and to know what you will be doing is to Code! Code! Code!

This couldn't be furthest from the truth. Computer Science is not about programming. Yes, you do program but Computer Science is much more than that. The title seems to be correct but your references to CS are just bullsh*t. Stop diluting CS to: ""It's very easy to know what CS is like and what to expect: Code! Code! Code!""
By just ""Code Code Code"" you'll only improve your knowledge about the language's syntax, nothing more....

Yes go ahead and pick Python but come on.. Javascript...really?";;
"> what CS is like and what to expect: Code! Code! Code!

That is not very precise. I'm a German Bachelor CS student for example, and my university focuses on the mathematical approach a whole lot more than on programming.
Please keep in mind that current day CS is a very broad field: You have engineers (programmers), scientists, and in a way, artists (hackers in the classic sense) all under one huge umbrella term.
I recommend that beginners decide for themselves which of these roles they want to pursue.
For the programming role, this is excellent advice.";;
This is wrong on so many levels...;;
I disagree, CS is most definitely not code, code code. Learning to code is important but coding is just a tool for a computer scientist to use, not what a computer scientist does. ;;

"Twisted docs

https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/";;
The standard Python docs explain things fairly well.;;
"You don't have to do anything, it uses a futex under the hood to implement the mutex.
";;
Question, if that's the case is there a need to use the pthread_spin_* at all then? ;;
[Spinlocks are sometimes faster](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6603404/when-is-pthread-spin-lock-the-right-thing-to-use-over-e-g-a-pthread-mutex), a futex has the implied cost of context switches and kernel mode waiting via the use of a syscall. A spinlock does not, if the other process is going to hold the lock for a just few instructions, it's actually faster to do a spinlock because your thread doesn't need to hand off to the kernel.;;
"Question, is there a kind of rwlock kind of implementation which spins? If I have a bunch of readers that do quick, near-but-not-quite atomic operations which can safely be read by more than one thread, and a writer that also does very quick operations , wouldn't a rwspinlock be a good use for such a scenario?

I.E Reading more than one value from a struct, saving them, then releasing the lock to act on them, as they're not critical enough to be done inside the lock. Writing updates to said struct. Etc. Short critical sections for reading and writing.";;
I don't think so, but you can implement it fairly easily with pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() and pthread_rwlock_tryrdlock() which is pretty close to a spinlock.;;
That definitely is simpler than what I was originally thinking of doing, thank you, looks like a nice start. ;;
"One more question regarding spinlocks, specifically with C. If a thread holding a spinlock enters an async signal handler, wouldn't that cause potential problems? Sure, the chances of it happening may be extremely rare, but lets say that there's no way to know in advance whether or not one will be used (as since it's a library, it's use could vary greatly). Would it then just be safer to just default to a mutex anyway for reliable performance?

For example...

**Thread A)** Acquires lock to do some work. For some strange reason, it must handle an async request for an indeterminate amount of time (I.E sleeping or waiting on a condition variable).

**Thread B)** Attempts to acquire lock, which would normally takes nanoseconds, could take seconds to minutes to hours depending on when the thread in the signal handler is woken up. Wastes a ton of CPU. 

A hybrid between a spinlock and mutex would have been best for general cases like this, right? Is there a C lock implementation that could handle something like that?";;
"> could take seconds to minutes to hours

Hopefully not, signal handlers should be as small and fast as possible for that reason. They should also be totally lockless and not allocate any memory because they can create race conditions and deadlocks with their parent thread. Assuming the signal handler executes quickly, then the lock will be acquired quickly anyways, even if it's slightly slower.

In short, a signal handler should NEVER wait for ANYTHING, if responding to the signal requires waiting for an event then the signal handler should set some flag or something that results in some other thread waiting for the event. And writes to anything need to be done in an atomic way really to avoid locks (you can't generally add things to a queue or pool from a signal handler because you can't use locks and other threads could be modifying it). There are a few exceptions to this, but it's best to just avoid anything that waits, locks, or allocates (or frees) anything on the heap, they all cause problems.";;

"I don't think 2-3 hours per day is a lot. I doubt you'll be ready for a job in a year or two.

Remote jobs for developers are okay-ish. You can definitely find full-time remote work but it's not gonna be easy. Web development work has the best options for remote work--you can do it while freelancing, you can do consulting, and you can do full-time employment while working remotely. ";;
"> I value the freedom to move around greatly and so want to find a career which offers remote working, whether on a contractual or a freelance basis.

I think a lot of people want that, but I'd estimate something like 99% of people still don't work remotely, so it's not like these remote jobs are everywhere, at least in programming.  And all programming jobs aren't created equal.

1) Go look at online programming sites, like odesk?  Last I checked the pay was garbage.

2) That depends on you and the work you really be doing.  ""Web dev"" is far too nebulous to say if you'd be ready for it in a certain time frame with any accuracy.  I'd say if you put in some effort and made some real progress, not just learning HTML, you'd be able to judge for yourself.

3) Not in general, no.  But if you're only considering remote jobs and you don't have a degree, it's going to be considerably harder for some jobs.  Maybe you could start with the shittiest jobs out there and eventually work your way up.  The guys at the local Python meetup have trouble finding enough clients, so I think with you having no contacts and constantly moving around you'd have similar or worse problems.

4) Start with the things in the FAQ.  I know everyone's a unique snowflake, but the FAQ is still pretty good.

"First off, I would post this in /r/cscareerquestions. You'll get more appropriate feedback there.

But just my two cents for the heck of it: Programming is, in my humble opinion, always an option for someone who wants to learn and apply a new skill on their own. However, it takes a lot of study,  practice, and headache to improve and use it professionally if you haven't studied it formally. 

HTML and CSS are a good starting point, but those are web development languages, and traditional programming languages such as C, C++, Python, and Java function very differently. I would look into those first (see the FAQ here for resources) and find out if you still ""like what you see."" Or, if web development is your goal, look into PHP and JavaScript.

"Hi David, 
this is a huge and complex field. It depends on so many things that it is not possible to list them all. As you already mentioned it depends on how your html is structured, whats in it and so on and on. On the other side it depends on backlinks and so on. Huge topic and really essential for a good side. Just search in the web to find tips and tricks and a starting point :)

"I tend to _strongly_ disagree.

Quantum mechanics is a huge and complex field. SEO is not. SEO is not even a field of knowledge. It's just a buzzword for a bunch trial-and-error-conclusions that too many people blog about and that may change anyday when the big search engine providers change their implementations, mixed with just a bunch of common-sense-do-it-anyway practices (i.e. only one `<h1>`, not skipping one of the h-levels etc.). It's some kind of holy grail to technically illiterate business people and it's placebo vodoo magic if you actually know what you are doing.

Good content owns SEO big times.";;

"SEO is the way you build, market and optimize your website so that Google (primarily) will rank it higher on their search engines when someone searches for a specific keyword.

ie. if you are an online flower store, and someone searches for, lets say, ""Flowers for my Bae"", you will want your website to rank higher than the other results right?!

SEO isn't a website development/programming solution, but a marketing solution. Traffic, visitors, and even social media effect your ranking.";;
Haha yes you are right! :) Really good point! Of course basically SEO is really easy to archive, I was more referring to get proper results out of it (or even the maximum). And where you are right that SEO is totally easy compared to Quantum mechanics I meant that you should not underestimate the complexity and value of SEO. Besides that its not something for stupid business people only. Everyone wants their site to appear often in search engines so yeah...it is something business related, but you get the point...;;
"I've thought of a few ways to respond to this.... and I'm not gonna mince words.  Sorry dude, I just don't think its a good idea.

Here's the thing... every novice question EVER has already been asked, and answered, hundreds, thousands of times over on existing, freely accessible media.  The advantage of forums, message boards, even IRC, is that all of those questions and answers are *publically searchable*.  That's one of the reasons that expert-level programmers (who tend to be fanatics about *efficiency*) agree to take on those novice questions: because they know, they are not just helping the one guy who happened to ask - they are also helping the thousands of people who will hit that same problem, will Google it, and will find their answer.

Putting that kind of resource behind a paywall just doesn't make sense.  A good programmer commands a respectable salary - how much do you really think you can offer them to make it worth their while.

It sounds like you're griping that you cannot get instant, expert-level feedback on your particular problem, 24/7.  Seriously...?  In this day and age, you have incredible access to so much information on such a short feedback loop its ridiculous.  A Google search takes a few seconds to a few minutes.  IRC, especially for novice-level questions, can yield valuable feedback within minutes.  StackOverflow and other such message-board type sites?  Hours to days, maybe?  If you're at a traditional university, I'm sure they have at least daily tutoring/office hours/etc - which you're already paying for.  You're seriously complaining that that feedback loop is not *fast* enough?  That you're willing to pay someone money to be on call to answer your every (boring, uninteresting, novice-level) question faster so that you don't have to wait a few minutes???

Computer programming is a skill which takes years, decades to fully develop.  You know how experienced programmers got that way?  They *struggled* with problems.  They experimented with trial and error.  They read documentation.  They used *much slower* methods of communication like mailing lists, USENET, or just asking an expert in person whenever they happened to encounter this person.  Go read /u/ike_the_strangetamer's excellent description of [how to learn programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3c7wmm/my_serious_answer_to_how_to_learn_programming/).  Focus on the part about how ""real coding is not knowing what you are doing.""

Seriously - a *huge* part of learning to program is being able to work through those situations where you've hit a wall, where you don't know what to do, and you are frustrated, and Google can't find you the answer, and you've posted to StackOverflow but are waiting for a reply.  Those are *good* experiences.  They help you learn new ways to solve problems.  Or they give you an opportunity to change gears and work on something else for a while, so that you can approach the problem from a fresh perspective later.  If you cannot learn to do that as a novice programmer, you will not be able to succeed once you start needing to solve *new* problems as a programmer.  Because eventually your 24/7 on call mentor just won't know how to do what you're asking.  Now your mentor will do all the things I just said - they'll experiment, they'll search google, they'll read documentation, they'll read other people's code - and really that's what *you* need to learn how to do.";;
"woot woot! *Why when I was your age, we didn't have your internets and slack-a-whatsits. We had books! And we read them!*

But seriously, the path to becoming an expert is loaded with trial and error. The only reason anyone else knows this stuff is because they had to bang their head against the desk enough times before they got it to work. And from that they learned how to minimize the head banging in the future. And that's how experts are born.

And while I completely agree with /u/gmdm1234, if three hundred folks are willing to pay me $20 a month, I'll gladly google shit for you all day :) ";;
"LOL - yeah, some of that attitude may have bled into my response.  But I'm more in shock that someone would actually complain that things like IRC take *too long* to get a response...

Just today, for example, I was having some trouble with some C development.  Spent about an hour or so Googling, and wasn't too successful.  Figured I'd give IRC a shot.  Within *minutes* I was in a conversation with three or four other developers discussing the problem, and potential solutions.  And it wasn't just ""people Googling shit for me"" - it was an actual, thoughtful discussion where different ideas were presenting, critical questions were asked, and eventually a workable solution was arrived at.

**Within minutes**.

Can you talk about project ideas that you got from a mentor that you honesty couldn't have come up with on your own or more importantly couldn't have come up with an equivalent idea for?

How exactly do you want it sorted? In order to apply any form of sorting algorithm, you need to define exactly what it means for one element to come before another. In a linear array that is trivial - an element is before another if it's index is less. In a 2 dimensional array where all elements have 2 indices, it's not clear what you're asking for.;;
" In example, I have a 2 x 2 (row and column) and i need to sort it using selection sort algorithm.

Value input by the user before the sorting process

    6 8

The value stored in 2 x 2 array is in ascending order.";;
"> Value input by the user before the sorting process 5 2 8 6

That's not a 2 dimensional array. That is one dimensional. ""Ascending order"" is meaningless when talking about two dimensions; you need to be clearer what you mean.";;

"Alright, so you are reading the array in [column-major order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column-major_order). I assume that you would expect the sorted array 2D array to look like:

     |2 6|
     |5 8|

This isn't the only way to do it - another common choice is row-major order which would give this result:

    |2 5|
    |6 8|

To sort this way, I would read the values into a linear array, sort that, and then transfer those values into the two dimensional array the way you want. Selection sort requires that you can form an sub array from a set of elements from your first array - this won't work if you require that all arrays are two dimensional (if you use arrays of arrays, you could just about make it work, but it's needlessly complicated).";;
"That has pointlessly large overhead. The difference between a 2d array and a 1d array here is (or should be) largely superficial. 

    array[10][3]

is typically equal to

    array[row * 10 + 3]

Due to being able to index like this there is no reason why sorting has to be any different to normal methods and can't be in place";;
"Yes, in place sort will work given a suitable mapping between the two dimensional coordinates and the underlying linear array. Selection sort can be implemented in place so it could be made to work. I was thinking of a selection sort that actually maintains two seperate arrays.

Note that if efficiency is a concern, selection sort is an awful choice anyway - use quicksort.";;
Well, it really depends on use case. The data and the programs operation may be such that this is an appropriate sort to use.;;
This is true, but I can't think of a situation where selection sort would be better than insertion sort, since insertion sort is pretty similar and tends to be more efficient.;;

In your case, the fact that you were able to take what you wanted to build, articulate what needs to be implemented, and start the process of breaking the problem down into smaller component parts is an encouraging sign (ie you're at least able to think about the complexity).

"Anything is possible, but your logic sounds complex to me and you'll do yourself a favour by not writing a mess of ifs and loops.

Leverage Java's type system and put some thought into what your unit elements are and how they interact.

You'll probably be less efficient overall if you use Python - in my experience anything longer than a few hundred lines turns into a big mess really fast.";;
"The reason that void is needed goes back to C++'s C roots. In old-fashioned C, you could write a function like this:

        meaning() {
             return 42;
        }

as having no return type meant that the function returned an int. To say that function returned nothing, you had to use void:

        void nada() {
               // return nothing
        }

This was carried over from C to C++, for compatibility purposes. 

With void as the parameter type, meaning this function takes no parameters,, then in C++ these function declarations are equivalent:

       int f();
       int f(void);

which one you use is largely a matter of style, and the common C++ style is to omit the void in this case.

    
      ";;
So this would be valid if I left the argument empty? As it calls nothing?;;
"It's valid to leave to leave the *parameter* list blank, without indicating void. In C++, this is the same as explicitly stating void for the parameter list.

As for the arguments when making a function call, in either scenario with C++, you can not pass in any arguments.";;
"void has many uses. One as you said is to indicate the return type. I guess thats just how the language and how C(the root of c++) works.  And then there is double getVol(void). The difference between getVol(void); and getVol() is following.     
If you have a function double getVol(void) {}; and you call the function getVol(10); then it will be an error. however if you just write a function getVol() {} then the call getVol(21) will just be a warning.    
second use of void are void pointers. This however is rarelyot at all used in c++(in other words: if you dont KNOW that u need to use it you probably dont need to use it). void pointers are pointers taht can point to anything. so you can do something like    
 void* ptr;
 int i = 20;
double j = 10.0;
ptr = &i ; or ptr = &j ... as said it can point to anything.";;
"> however if you just write a function getVol() {} then the call getVol(21) will just be a warning.

oh... did not know that.;;
"Rotation matrices always rotate about the origin. In order to rotate about any other point, you want to perform a translation that moves the point you want to rotate about to the origin, then your rotation, and then you want to undo the translation you did.

Generally, you would set it up so that each object has its own origin, and that is the point you want the object to rotate around. The vertices of the object are then all given with respect to this origin. When you want to draw the object, you first apply the rotation matrix, and then you translate the object to the location on screen. If you get the order wrong, your object will still rotate around the world space origin, because matrix multiplication is **not commutative**.

If you're using the matrix stacks (which are now deprecated, but I assume you aren't concerened about that since you're also using immediate mode), then *only the matrix on top of the stack is actually used when drawing*. When you call glPushMatrix(), the current matrix is duplicated, and pushed on top of the stack. You can now apply further transformations to that matrix, and when you want to undo them, you call glPopMatrix() to revert to the previous state. So you might do:

    glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);//There are seperate stacks for modelview and projection matrices, so this must be called before glPushMatrix()

    glPushMatrix(); //Save the current modelview
    glRotatef(angle,0.0f,0.0f,rotatePlayer);//Do rotation first
    glTranslatef(player.x,player.y, 0.0);//Assuming player.x and player.y are the coordinates of the player
    playerModel();
    glPopMatrix();//Restore the previous modelview matrix, removing transformations applied for the player

    glPushMatrix();//Save the modelview matrix again in preparation for drawing asteroid
    glTranslatef(asteroid.x, asteroid.y, 0.0f); //Translate asteroid to desired location on screen
    smallAsteroid();
    glPopMatrix();//Restore previous modelview matrix";;

"Discussing the *efficiency* of an algorithm using pseudo code allows you to focus on the exactly what the algorithm is doing without getting caught up in the trappings of a language and its interpretation by the compiler or runtime.  At least that's the theory.  Knuth's [The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming) actually uses assembly language for a hypothetical machine, [MIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIX), when analyzing algorithms.  At one time (perhaps still is), it was considered the bible of CS.        

If you want to understand how an algorithm is implemented, using a book specific to your language of choice might be an easier route.     

Also keep in mind that many of these texts don't really match the reality of today's CPU architecture.  Different levels of caching and things like predictive branching give results contrary to simplified analysis.  It can be a complex subject.     

I can't speak for CLRS as it was published well after I received my degree.  We used Niklaus Wirth's [Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_%2B_Data_Structures_%3D_Programs) which uses Pascal in all examples.  We didn't have a Pascal compiler.  Pascal was developed by the author as a language for teaching programming.  Great book in it's day -- still on my shelf, but note that it was written in a day where structured and procedural coding was the next big thing.      

tldr; whatever floats yer boat, but abstraction is supposed to make it easier to focus on how the algorithm works rather than how it is implemented.";;

In this situation, what conditions would you want to combine? Therefore, how would you do it?

Except that with this `if` statement, you're not ""accepting two values""; you're *rejecting everything else*. But that's simple; you want to negate the *combined* expression - so you write the combined expression, and then negate it.

> I think I understand why these don't work

In your own words, why not?

Bonus: Instead of trying to specify all the valid values and then negating the check, let's try another approach: if we want to see if the value is *un*acceptable, what values does it have to *not* have? And how would we combine those checks?

If so, and you weren't able to find anything useful, let me know what you tried searching for, and I can suggest how you can try improving your search queries to turn up more useful results.

"I read the docs, they just basically say:
> 
> break may only occur syntactically nested in a for or while loop, but not nested in a function or class definition within that loop.
> 
> It terminates the nearest enclosing loop, skipping the optional else clause if the loop has one.
> 
> If a for loop is terminated by break, the loop control target keeps its current value.
> 
> When break passes control out of a try statement with a finally clause, that finally clause is executed before really leaving the loop.

Which I pretty much already knew. Googling for the mechanism of how break works hasn't really come up with anything";;
I think I see what's happening now, the break is breaking out of the for loop but not the while loop. still don't see the 'right' way to make this while loop without the janky z variable hack;;
"Exactly. 

So, first, I don't think having that extra variable is necessarily a ""hack"" -- if you rename it to something like `continue_looping` or `input_invalid`, then it looks nicer. For example:

    input_invalid = True
    while input_invalid:
            letters = scorer.get_letter_set()
            for letter in letters:
                if letters[letter] in scorer.vowels:
                    input_invalid = False
                    break

(The logic here is not identical to your original code, but I'm guessing this may have been what you meant, since your original 'working' code will effectively only ever check the last letter in `letters` and determine whether or not to quit the outer loop based on that. If that _is_ the behavior you were trying to do, then you can just replace your entire for loop and just look directly at the end of the list.)

Alternatively, you could place your code into a function, and return when some condition is met:

    def something(scorer):
        while input_invalid:
            letters = scorer.get_letter_set()
            for letter in letters:
                if letters[letter] in scorer.vowels:
                    return

And you could make this even shorter by taking advantage of sets -- take your letter, the vowels, convert them into sets, take the intersection, and see if they overlap or not:

    def something(scorer):
        while True:
            letters = scorer.get_letter_set()
            if len(set(letters) & set(scorer.vowels)) > 0:
                return # or use a break

";;
thanks for the intersection example, that's a nice tidy way to handle it and I haven't really experienced them before;;
"I think your next step should be to use what you've learned and start making basic websites. There's no point in delaying -- the best way to learn is by doing, and the best time to start working towards your goal is now.

(And if you don't feel ready + don't know how to go about using what you were taught to make a website, the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_get_started_making_websites.2Fmaking_webapps.2Fdoing_web_development.3F) has links to additional resources/tutorials that are more comprehensive then CodeCademy that you can look through).

After making a few website and getting a few projects under your belt, I would suggest learning JavaScript next.";;
My next step was to start with PHP. I think it is an easy and powerful language that really gives you a good starting point for following programming languages. You could try to build really basic websites together with your previous earned skills. Make a Twitter Clone, a Chat App, and so on. It gives you a great pleasure of actually doing something visible! Of course you could combine Javascript with it, but I dont find it that interesting or beautiful...Maybe you could take an insight into NodeJs?;;

"If a game is running on your computer, that means that the computer is capable of interpreting and running your program. And if a computer can do that, so can a human being. And if a human being can read and perfectly understand a program, that means that they can also arbitrarily modify it.

That means that any game you allow the user to download and run will eventually be cracked, as long as it's popular enough. At that point, it becomes an arm's race. The game developer's goal is then not to prevent people from cracking it -- rather, it's to _delay_ things and force the hackers to take longer and longer until interest has died down + most people have already bought the game. 

The game developers will then try and make the code as confusing to understand as possible + add in booby traps so naive modifications will cause subtle errors, and the hackers will try and circumvent those protections. 

This cat-and-mouse game can get genuinely intriguing -- for example, the developers of Spyro wrote an [article on Gamasutra](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131439/keeping_the_pirates_at_bay.php) talking about the techniques they used to delay people from cracking their copy protections. It's pretty fascinating -- give it a read.

In contrast, the code for online multiplayer games is fundamentally different in that the code does not live on your computer, but lives on the developer's computers. As a consequence, the hackers are unable to ever read the code + modify the code, and so cannot totally control + take ownership of it in the same way they can do to a program they've downloaded. 

However, they _can_ modify the client, intercept + modify the messages the client sends out or receives, attempt to send malformed messages that the server can't handle/will crash on, try and guess the passwords, etc... And in fact, if the server did not properly account for all these different forms of attacks/cannot handle all possible input, and the hacker is able to exploit a flaw, then they could theoretically take complete control of the computer (depending on the nature of the flaw). And to make it worse, not all attack are purely technical -- human beings maintain the servers, and it's definitely possible to manipulate and hoodwink humans into doing something they shouldn't (it's often easier then mounting a technical attack -- humans are usually the weakest link in the chain by far). 

While idk if this sort of thing has happened to gaming servers (I haven't been keeping track), it has definitely happened to different websites over the past few years. You've probably heard news stories about hackers stealing people's personal info/banking account and such -- that's basically what's happening.

 

";;
"There have also been efforts to reverse-engineer what the servers do based on intercepting traffic to/from clients, or extensively reversing the client to the extent you can figure out what the server should be doing. Not to have a 1:1 copy of the server's algorithms, data, etc., or get a ""free"" account, but to reasonably approximate the game experience with a 3rd party server.

Sometimes the client also needs to be patched for this type of scheme to work (or requires specific client versions, since any patch could introduce or modify the way messages are handled), and it's not trivial to create such a server, but it has been done to World of Warcraft and other games.

People on those servers are naturally only able to interact with each other; it's the difference between taking reddit's code and making another website (3rd party server; not connected with reddit-proper despite similarities of features) vs. coercing reddit to create you an admin account (Pirate King Mode) vs. just making a normal account on reddit (like a regular user).

And of course there can be the same (or worse) legal issues with creating, hosting, releasing, or even attempting to understand such a server.

Edit: ""the difference between taking reddit's code and making another website"" I should have analogy more gooder: it's more like taking a reddit mobile app, looking at (a disassembly of) its code and the traffic it sends/recvs, and using that data to try to build your own reddit clone, and patch the app to use your server instead of real-reddit.";;
If you run a game, you can read and understand the code is not always true. Have you heard about whitebox cryptography ?;;
"Obfuscation doesn't make it impossible. Fact is the CPU absolutely must be running all the code and you must be holding all the memory required at some point, and an end-user can arbitrarily access the state of the CPU and RAM for a process. 
";;
Yeah, White box cryptography is in principle a way to provide obfuscation even when you have access to everything. I can't really explain it, it's hard, but you should look it up. Not really used yet, since it's pretty new. There are ways to crack it, but it's hard.;;
"I think you misunderstand white-box cryptography. Obfuscation makes it hard to read algorithms, white-box cryptography makes it hard to read cryptography keys in code. Both run completely on the client and can be deciphered, they just make it harder than opening a RAM dump and reading the key or algorithm like a book.

If the CPU can decode the key anyone with access to the code the CPU was given can.

Another thing to keep in mind when you read things like this is people will claim things - none of the current white-box cryptography algorithms are considered sound and most think they never will be.";;
I don't just read things like this, I work with people cracking things like this. There are, and there will always be, ways to crack everything. My point was : with white box algorithms as a way to protect software with DRM, it makes it harder, and nearly impossible sometimes, given the price and time involved, since it's a quite new field. And there are safe white box algorithms, at least safe enough to be used by big companies I won't cite, for obvious reasons ;-);
A lot of the time it isn't actually decompiling the game and reading the code. You can learn a lot through blackbox testing the processes by going all the way down to the smallest levels and analyze how the actual bit registers change with various inputs and outputs;;
"For what /u/micheal0x2a wrote, it should be clear that any offline-DRM mechanism is ultimately futile.

Only online-DRM is viable in the long run. While people have cracked Steam games, it wasn't able for them to connect to legit servers (servers that are registered at the Valve/Steam master server and that ask the master server about the legitimacy of a user connecting).

Without an insider it's practically impossible to know and trick the master server or servers communicating with it.

Also...

> seemingly easy

It's a very intellectually demanding activity to reverse engineer and crack software.";;
"Most studios do not roll their own DRM solution. They buy it from a third party.

If you've cracked one, you've cracked them all.

Games that took particularly long to crack are ones that rolled their own. They would often make it so that strange and subtle oddities would occur in-game. So you'd never know if you succeeded until someone took the time to play through it.

It slows the cracking process down significantly.

e.g. Earthbound would delete your save before the final boss. I think I remember one of the Batman games cutting gliding time down. Making the game impossible to finish. The change isn't obvious. ";;
"If you pirate the game called ""Game Dev Tycoon,"" once you start becoming a huge success and you are a good amount of the way through, all of your games get cracked and you lose all of your money lmao";;
If I remember right I don't even think that was DRM. The devs uploaded a modified copy to pirate sites.;;
I loved that game;;
"All these answers are spot on. All I will add is that also a lot of the time, the more secure an application becomes, the more of a hassle it is for the standard, legitimate user to use. Take Photoshop for example. When you first install it, you need an active internet connection to communicate with Adobe's servers and validate the software. After that, Adobe doesn't want to force users to always have an internet connection to use their software as it would aggravate a large portion of users, so they just have future runs of the program send out a probe to their servers if there happens to be an internet connection and if the servers then realize you are using a cracked version, they will lock the software. Crackers get around this by redirecting what server the probe gets sent out to so that Adobe doesn't catch wind of it being cracked.

 As there is no such thing as a perfect security system, it all comes down to a balancing act. Sometimes giving a convenience to the vast majority of your users and allowing a handful of cracks is better for business than locking everything down. However for things such as passwords, you would rather have a false-negative (i.e. entering a correct password and the computer thinking it is incorrect) than having a false-positive (the computer thinking an incorrect password is the correct one).";;

Youd should just get yourself a cheap hosting plan. The are starting at about 1-2 Dollar and thats it. For the beginning this is really enough! When you get yourself a VPS you are responsible for this machine and when you dont have a clue or just want to learn one thing at a time this might be a bad idea...;;
"Okay.. Reading about this, these two options are Shared and VPS?

So the question is, with both, I can display my HTML/JavaScript/CSS skills, right?

If I go with VPS, will I need to learn PHP, Django, etc (don't know anything about them yet)?";;
"Of course they can. When you just take a webhosting plan everything you need ist provided by the plan you ordered. For example PHP, Perl, MySQL and so on (not every hoster provides Django!). Everything you order is managed and you will never have to worry about anything technical. When you order an VPS everything is on you. You basically get your SSH Login and thats it. For example Debian or Ubuntu Server edition (sometimes with preinstalled software like a webserver). Of course this gives you a lot of freedom. You can install what ever you want. You dont have to look for specialized webhosters that support Django e.g.  With this freedom comes great responsibility. When your Apache just wont start it is on you! If you get hacked it is on you!
In my opinion it is a good idea to START with some cheap hosting. After you earned some skill you can go on and learn new things. 
It on you :) ";;
Extremely helpful information! Thanks a bunch;;
If you're on Windows and you want to host it yourself look up I IS. If you want to take the way way and host it somewhere else you'll need to pay for hosting space from someone. You'll also probably want a domain name that you can tell people to use to visit your website. ;;

The cheapest digitalocean account is only 5 dollars a month.";;

I've never been asked XSLT questions in an interview and it's never been widely used, afaik.;;
It really doesn't matter and entirely depends on your design. JS would imply you're pulling all API data client side and allowing the client's browser to do any caching, which you probably don't want. You can't parse API data using CSS (if that is what you are asking...), it's just markup. As for server side + some form of caching, any language the server supports is fine - Python, PHP, ASP, etc.;;

"I would personally actually use a text file. Excel spreadsheets will require a separate library to use + isn't a very portable or lightweight format, SQL seems like overkill (500 items is very very tiny), and adding the ingredients directly in your code would probably get cumbersome.

If the data is already in an excel spreadsheet, you can export it into CSV (comma-separated value) format, which is basically a text file. You can then open + parse the text file by hand, or use Python's CSV library to parse it.

If you feel strongly about using SQL, then I would recommend using SQLite, which is a lightweight database system + comes bundled by default with Python + does not require installation or configuration. The database is literally a single file. 

In terms of speed of execution, the text file or SQLite solution is probably going to be comparable in terms of speed. (More specifically, you probably won't notice a difference in terms of speed since the amount of data you have is so tiny).

In terms of expandability, probably the text file, since you can just open it with your favorite text editor + add your new ingredient to the bottom. 

However, if you start doing increasingly complex things with your data/if your data is starting to become complex, it might be worth switching to using SQL (though I'd still use SQLite).";;

"What I would do: if the program is a library, start by making a very simple program that uses the library in a basic way. Then, with every class or function you call from the library, find that file, drill down, and figure out how it works. (It would also be helpful to spend more time just working and using the library in general so you get an even better feel for how it's designed).

With each new file you open, you'll probably run into more files/classes/functions that the library uses. Keep drilling down until you feel you have a suitable understanding of how the codebase roughly works + you feel you've hit a level of abstraction where you don't need to keep drilling.

If the program is more of an actual application/program, try and find the 'main entry point', and do the same thing. Start there, drill down.

Take notes during this entire process, draw diagrams, read whatever documentation is available, etc. I also wouldn't try and understand _everything_ about the codebase from the get-go -- just enough to get a feel for it.

It can often be easier to work with your own code instead of starting in the middle of somebody else's project + it'll give you experience in how to start simple, and grow a program until it becomes complex.";;
"The best advice is to not understand every line of code.

Think of it like this. If you are at destination A and need to go to destination B, all you need to know is how to drive there. You don't need to know build that car.

Same for coding. Well-written modules have good abstraction. If there's a drive(); function just use it. You don't need to read the thousands of lines of code behind that function. It will take forever.

That's why big projects should be very well documented. Just read the APIs and you'll know what to do.";;
"At some point, an application becomes too large to fit into a single person's head.

There are many moving parts, lots of interconnected components, layers and interfaces - and the only way to cope with this is to impose rules on how you work.

So you want to implement A, but a depends on B and C and if you change C then D changes too and that means that E & F need refactoring... STOP. If you ever find yourself in this situation, you need to lay down some ground rules.

* Use Interfaces to abstract behavior. An object has a contract that it agrees to satisfy - this saves you headspace and prevents accidental misuse.

* Keep your variables private. You need to trust that things stay where you put  them when you add new behavior. Don't make it possible for other objects to use you for their storage.

* Shared mutable state considered harmful. Everyone knows not to use globals, but they won't bat an eye at declaring a public static variable.

* Magic is bad. Like when a function runs because you imported a module, or if someone is monkey patching objects at runtime.

If these rules aren't followed, a tool like a compiler should get you to fix it. Python does all of the above very badly, so try to pick a language that doesn't let get you into bad habits out of the box.

There are lots of other ways to fit a large project in your head, but it comes down to trust. Trust that an object will honor it's interface contact. Trust that the libraries you are using will do what they advertise and *only* what they advertise. Trust that the pile of code you wrote your code on has some basic quality standards, and suddenly writing big apps isn't so hard.

"Your best bet might be to try with a beginner-friendly programming language such as Python. You can just search online for code snippets that do what each of your steps describe, then piece them together.


As you may expect, most programmers, even professional ones, do not write programs only after completely learning a whole language. Everyone starts with learning some subset of a language necessary to write some specific program, then learn more as they need to improve that program, to add new features, or to write a different program.


In your /r/requestabot post, some things are not fully described, and you may have to think in terms of how the programming language approaches a task. e.g. step 5 - how do you propose to go to a user's saved page?

For a human, this will consist of opening a browser, entering a specific URL, and logging in if necessary. For a program, this may consist of making https requests for login etc. and then parsing the response text.

This will result in a string ""#h"" which is then concatenated with m by converting m to a string, and so on for s

"You should absolutely not be concerned about performance of single instructions.

If you were to look at a simplified computing model, where you have one core with 2Ghz, which can process 2 billion operations per second and you'd assume, that one of the code pieces took 2 and the other 14 operations (so one of them would be 7x faster!), then the time gain for one execution would only be (14-2) / 2.000.000.000 = 0,000 000 006s = 6ns. So to gain, say, half a second of time, you would have to run this ~83 million times! And that is a very low estimation.

It's much better to think about if you can avoid having to run a piece of code billions of times; maybe there is a solution which doesn't need to loop as often? Don't think about constants (2 operations vs 14 operations) but think about loop counts (something running N^2 times vs something running just N times).

That said, x % 2 == 1 and x & 0x01 are not even equivalent and neither of them do what you want for every value of x.

Say x is a signed integer. If x uses ones' complement (which C and C++ admit), then -1 is represented as 11...10 while 1 is represented as 00...01, so -1 & 1 == 0. The ""oddness""-test fails.

x % 2 == 1 also has a problem if x is negative. ""x % ..."" preserves the sign of x, so if x is negative and odd, then x % 2 == -1.

What you should be writing is

    if (x % 2 != 0) type = odd;

This will work for each and every case, be it a signed integer or unsigned integer, independent of internal representation.

And if it really can be optimized (in the sense of using 2 instead of 14 operations), your compiler will take care of it, have some faith in it.";;
"Look at the assembly and see for yourself.

The real answer is that it does not matter, and that this kind of optimization is *not* something you should be worried about.";;
Just a tip although you probably already know, asking a question like this, but you could use just `x%2` and drop the `==1`.;;
That would change the behaviour for negative numbers.;;
"These code samples are not the same: for odd negative numbers `x % 2` will be `-1` , so it would only detect positive odd numbers. 

If you have `if ( x >= 0 )` beforehand, or if `x` is unsigned , then the compiler should generate the same code for both cases. That's why we have compilers: to translate our program specification into the best possible CPU instructions.";;
You can always check what your compiler has generated. ;;
Is this really your performance bottleneck? If there is any difference - there may not be since an optimizer may generate the same code for both - it will be insignificant to the performance gains you can get with design changes to your program.;;

"> When will all of these technique come together to create these amazing programs I was promised? 

This is hard to say -- it depends partly on how much you've learned so far, and what exactly you consider to be ""amazing"" (a program that one person considers amazing, another person might consider dull, and vice versa).

But ultimately, it depends on you. You get to start making amazing programs the moment you go out and decide to start making them. Honestly, that's all it takes -- literally google ""how do I do X in Java"" where ""X"" is the thing you want to do, and look through the tutorials and guides that come up. 

If you don't understand a single word of what's going on, then you know that you have some more studying to do. If you do understand, or feel close to understanding, then keep going, work through the guides, and make your program.

Programming requires a certain degree of independence and self-learning, which may feel unusual/different, especially if all you're used to doing is learning from teachers + doing school work. Basically, you need to learn to make your own motivation + figure out how to apply what you've learned independently. Aggressively google and ask questions.

> Exactly how can assigning variables and creating objects and such be used to create visual interactive programs? 

This is sort of like asking ""how exactly can wood be used to create furniture?"". 

But to try and answer your question, what you typically do is download a 3rd party library that does the things you want, create the objects it provides, call methods on those objects to make things happen, remember things by using variables, etc., and just wire and combine everything until you have a working program.

(And the people who made the library did the exact same thing, except that they used a simpler, more primitive library, and the people who made the primitive library did the exact same thing, except using an even more primitive library, and if you keep going, you'll bottom out where somebody is eventually just directly interacting with your operating system.)

"> 2) Exactly how can assigning variables and creating objects and such be used to create visual interactive programs?

There are actually three very different questions you might be asking.

If you're asking how to make a GUI program, well, you'll get there eventually. Once you know the basics, like others are saying, you'd pull in some library -- the simplest might be to just play around with Swing, since it's built into Java. Swing isn't the best, but it might be easier to start with than to pull in something else.

The other obvious route would be to play with something like Android, where you can pretty easily put together a Hello World app and start filling in the blanks with your code.

If you're asking this rhetorically -- like, ""Why am I learning all this stuff when it doesn't seem to have anything to do with actual programs?"" -- I promise it does. You'll get there eventually.

If you're asking *how it works* -- that is, *how* does that graphics library actually work, or how could you write your own if you had to -- well, it's not at all practical to write your own, but you might get something out of [this course](http://www.nand2tetris.org/). It won't teach you Java at all, but it'll give you a very beginner-level understanding of how something like Java *actually works,* and how GUIs actually work, and so on. If you understand how a NAND gate works -- or if you're willing to accept what it *does* -- then this shows you how you'd build a game like Tetris out of them. And you could go off and study how you build a NAND gate out of transistors and stuff if you want.

It's beginner-level on purpose, because it's meant to be a one-semester whirlwind tour of the entire stack. Every level it goes through is something you could spend a lifetime studying, so of course it's dumbed down to something you can actually understand. So, for example, modern graphics hardware is a lot fancier than just a framebuffer that's mapped directly into your address space, but people really used to build GUIs that way -- and if you wanted to get into how modern GUIs work, you'd find some similarities.

The one drawback is that you probably want to learn Java reasonably well *before* you attempt something like this. That course assumes you already know how to program.";;
"> 1) When will all of these technique come together to create these amazing programs I was promised?

It is going to be a while before you can start creating amazing programs like you were promised. Start learning Python or Javascript/HTML. With these languages you are more likely to get a heads up creating stand-alone and useful programs. Or you try a functional programming language like Haskell if you are looking for some fun. 

This doesn't mean Java isn't useful. I'm a Java programmer myself. I'm saying you will have more fun with Python if you are really interested in building useful tools/projects quickly.

> 2) Exactly how can assigning variables and creating objects and such be used to create visual interactive programs?

"Hey, as someone whose also been learning Java over the last school year, I can tell you that it does. I can definitely relate to how you feel, as that was me a few months ago. I got the ideas, but couldn't really grasp how an application or game could be made out of that.

What you're currently learning are the building blocks - the things that allow you to store information and move it around. There are more concepts yet to learn that help you create a program and a GUI that responds to your actions.

I'm currently creating my first Android App, and without that stuff I'd be lost. You build on that to implement the more complex concepts that apply to what you want to make - network connections, graphics rendering, etc. There are frameworks and classes you interact with to do that stuff - kind of like how you can use Array Lists and their public methods to organise your objects.

I'm still fairly junior myself so hopefully that wasn't all guff, but what I'm trying to say is that the puzzle does start to come together, you just need to have patience and make sure you learn the ground level stuff :)";;
"I was you, fifteen months ago.

Codecademy is the little alphabet blocks you played with as a toddler. Yep, you learn that there are different letters, and you get that some of them have names, but you won't come even close to the 'big picture' without an adult's help, or some serious learning of your own.

So. Follow after me- install Notepad++. It's an all-purpose text editor, which means that it's the best IDE you could possibly want right now. Create a file called 'test.py'. Save it somewhere, maybe on your desktop. In Notepad++, write: print(""Hello world"").

Install python. If you're in Windows, this is going to be kinda tricky. Go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pick 2 or 3. Flip a coin, honestly, as long as it keeps you going. You'll have to change the path. Check out this StackOverflow [question here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6318156/adding-python-path-on-windows-7). (Hint: If you picked Python 3, you may have to change something there). If you run Linux (*cough as you should cough*), this has already been done for you.

Open up a terminal or command line. Try using the commands 'cd' and 'ls' (or 'dir' in Windows) until you get to the folder where test.py is. cd **c**hanges **d**irectory (as folders are called), ls lists all files and folders in the current directory.

Now: python test.py

If the terminal prints out ""Hello world"", you've just run your first program. Way to go!

That's how you do things from now on. Executing code in the browser just takes you away from learning what code is actually good for (until you hit Javascript, which... executes code inside the browser. Another day, though).

So, with Notepad++ and your terminal/command line, practice your simple programs. Write and read from files (this is called IO, and is pretty damn important for many, many tasks). Reverse strings. Solve math problems. Write stuff that reacts to other stuff (*if* this *print* that). Play around.

Go to codeabbey.com. Try some of the exercises. Try completing them in different ways. If they ask for input (a string, say, or a list of numbers), practice getting that input from the command line (python test.py ""Test test test"") or read from a file (in text.txt, Test test test).

There are better text editors out there for when you need better tools. I recommend Vim or Emacs. Some people love SublimeText. 

The important thing with editors is, they don't hold your hand for errors. You have to think why your code isn't executing, what [insert arcane Python error here] means. Editors also make navigation, search, macros, etc. much easier, and work for all different languages.

It was really easy to move too fast through the course, without fully understanding what you're doing on the level you should before you move on. If you can't explain it in your own words, you probably don't fully understand the concept. 

It really helped me to try to backtrack, and often.  I remember having a hard time understanding iterator variables, for example.  Codecademy wouldn't explain it very well, I'd get frustrated, so I'd eventually go ""screw this, I'll just go back and review."" 

Every single time I did this I ended up getting further along than before.  I'd get stuck again, I'd backtrack, and pass through my trouble spot, much easier this time.  Some spots just took *forever,* like the battleship part. Remember that in a formal classroom, every concept is gone over at least a few times. You learn with an example or two, you review, then you test.  Codecademy does this too quickly, so make sure you back up. 

But, consider that codecademy just doesn't teach you the way *you* need to be taught. Personally, I need the casual sort of talk codecademy provides, almost like a conversation, but that might not be for you. ";;
I've been investigating IDE's and how they are a totally different game from writing code in Codecademy, I don't understand how different files can work together and how to properly utilize the useful features of each IDE.

">I understand I need to calculate not, then and then or, but I really don't know how too do it

By that do you mean that you do not know what ""not"", ""or"", and ""and"" mean, or that you do not see in which order to calculate them in the exercises or what values to apply them to, or what?

Yea they don't change but how do I calculate it when there's two or three different operators? 

For example, ""not not True or False and not True""..  How do i simplify it? Cause I assume that's what I need to do first? Cause I really don't know how to get a proper value out of it.";;
"These operators are no different in this regard from addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and so on. If you know how to add, and you know how to multiply, and you know that you multiply before you add and that you go left to right, then that's all you need to know to calculate the value of, say, 1 + 7 * 9 + 3. Nothing special needs to be done, there are no complications. Just do the multiplication first, then the left addition, then the right addition.

Thanks alot, fairly sure I understand now! ;;
"Just as some further explaining if you take the `True or not False and False` you can split it up into steps like the following:

Note: [] around true or false means it came from the result of the previous step

True or [False] = True";;

> My friend recommended that I begin contributing

Did they have any other ideas about it? Have they contributed to any projects?

> get a feel for real world coding

You could try a strategy somewhat like this rantish thing, for helping to maintain existing projects:

Find an issue tracker / bugs mailinglist / IRC log, read the problems people are having with the systems. Try to understand what the users are experiencing, and try to reproduce the issues they report.

When the issues are reproduced by you on your system, the technical details of your system and the steps you took could be very helpful to other developers (and to yourself if you want to attempt to understand and fix the issue).

So at that level, you would be contributing without needing to create/modify, test, and submit code yourself.

But you would become more familiar with the program overall and the issues users have, how to build the program, and communicate with people (or at least listen to them and send data).

Try to find the relevant areas of the system and understand what's going on when the issue happens. If there's a crash message, stack trace, or dump that can point the way, along with debugging tools and/or searching through many code files.

The complexity you see in projects may take a lot of time AND effort AND learning to feel that it's manageable, or at least to be comfortable with it and understand the components or subsystems to an extent.

When you work out what's going on, think of and try possible workarounds (ways to use the program to similar ends without encountering the issue) or (Hard Mode) create a patch so the issue goes away or is handled better (and test to make sure it works and doesn't break something else).

You have to make sure you have the tools (compilers / interpreters / development kits / version control / the code), dependencies (other projects / runtimes / libraries the programs rely on), and settings to get the program built and running on your machine (usually found in README file or install documentation), and you have to figure out how to communicate with the maintainers, other devs, and users (maybe all grumpy, especially if broken software and unreproduced bugs are involved).

Oh, and bug / issue / ticket systems usually have an area / field / category for ""feature requests"" if there's an ominous lack of open bugs or you just want the program to do something it doesn't do yet (features can be some of the best bugs).

I suspect this will vary depending on what kind of GPS device you're using, the strength of the internet connection, etc. I would recommend looking up the specifications for the GPS unit + looking at the numbers the manufacturers have provided.;;
This depends entirely on the device's APIs that you pull the data from. Many of them (Android, iOS) provide the tools for you to create moving maps without worrying too much about how fast the data is being collected.;;
"I don't have a source handy and it's been a while, but from some experience playing with GPS dongles, typically you can expect one location fix per second with inexpensive dongles.

How acceptable to you this is depends on how fast you're moving and your application. For speeds under 30 kph, you will not have moved outside the 8m error radius of unaugmented civilian gps receivers before the next update happens on a one second cycle. At higher speeds, users typically need to focus on travel rather than staring at a moving map.

I developed an in-vehicle information system for delivery truck drivers a couple of years ago. One screen featured a moving map showing their current position, assigned stops, path traversed, and suggested route. 

I don't remember the exact update interval I used, but I think it was one second. Each second, I would move the marker for the truck to the new fix position. During the span of the second before the next update, the map would smoothly pan to the new position. When the map arrived at the new position, it would be time for another marker update, and the map would have a new position to pan to.

Using this system, the marker is fixed during the update interval, but the map is constantly moving. It provided a really intuitive way to gauge speed and direction of travel.";;
Most GPS devices give you one sample per second. There are faster ones, I know some race drivers that use them in their car. If I recall correctly there are 5Hz devices which are fairly affordable. I think the 10Hz ones were significantly more. ;;

Thanks, will check it out for sure!;;
Btw in this demo, right at start he is saying stuff like releasing interfaces and stuff like that. I understand mostly what he is doing, but doesn't understand why do one need to, so it doesn't explain the big picture, he is just doing it, and all i can do is copy and don't understand.;;
Do you have experience in just pure C++ or have you actually dealt with Windows API stuff?

"As a programmer you can get a job in pretty much any language and the concepts transfer pretty well for example a good java developer could also move to .NET pretty easily. In your case C++ is a good base language that has skills that transfer into other object oriented complied languages. Python and javascript are both pretty good for web development and they have skills that help transfer to other scripting languages such as ruby. In my opinion your choice of initial languages is irrelevant its the skills you learn from those languages that are important.
";;
First of all, I don't accept the premise as I see these languages on job descriptions all the time, but more importantly, the specific language you use isn't important as far as experience. In any of thes languages, you can learn OOP and design patterns and data structures. Knowing the language you will be working in is always a bonus, but not always required.  In fact, when you interview you will often be asked to code in pseudocode; knowing a specific language isn't even an advantage there.;
Thanks, this helps a lot. I feel more comfortable with my choices because these are the languages I enjoy using the most (or learning to use the most).;;
Other than C++, I don't think it's possible to pick a language that won't have someone freaking out and telling you it's useless. And I can't even be sure about C++. I wouldn't worry too much about it.;;
I noticed this with the programming community too. People are really fanatical about a certain language and denounce the importance of all the other ones.;;
Learn what you want to learn, if you don't have fun then whats the point?;;
Fun pretty much has to be secondary to being employable though :( So I thought I would ask people who are in the industry if I'm on the right path or not.;;
Why? I'm perfectly employable, and I have fun everyday programming. I program at work and then I get home and program more. If you don't love what you do you're doing the wrong thing.;;
I guess you're right. The type of programming I want to do is the kind I enjoy as a relaxing hobby so maybe I'll just focus on making that my passion.;;
For example [this is my current project](http://i.gyazo.com/608555746640aa892fbb2a2757fc382e.png). I love doing this and there is no reason I can't do similar things at work, which I can't discuss because privacy agreements.;;
"JavaScript is the dominant language for web applications. How can anyone justify saying it's useless? Demand seems to exceed supply for JavaScript programmers based on my experience. Many APIs and servers are written in Python. Python also seems to be in demand right now or at least a nice bonus to have on your resume as a front-end or full-stack engineer. I think the people that told you they were useless or niche either don't know what they're talking about, have some weird bias against web development or like being contrarian to seem knowledgeable and intelligent.

Pick a language that you enjoy and that allows you to do the kinds of projects you want. If you're having fun and are interested in what you're doing, it will be much easier to maintain motivation and focus and to learn the concepts which are then applicable for many different languages. 

Don't get hung up early on about languages. In all likelihood, you will learn and use many different ones in your career. ";;
Good point. Thanks for your comment. I love Python actually so I'll stick with this and JavaScript for now instead of worrying about what other people say about it.;;
"Reddit is written in Python, so there is that. Hardly a niche language.

Also JavaScript is used on most websites these days. ";;
"Python is far from a niche language. 

Most jobs now want people who know a scripting language and Python is pretty much king of that realm. Python isn't like the C-family but it has it's place.

Ignore anyone who says Python is a niche language or won't be used in the future. 

Javascript is also far from being dead or worthless. It will definitely change but the fact it is **the** web language basically says a lot. There are indeed major changes happening in web development but learning Javascript isn't a waste of time.";;

Which menu do you mean? The ""about/download/demo/tutorial/ref"" menu or the top nav bar menu?";;
"The ""about/download/demo/tutorial/ref"" menu doesn't collapse to a hamburger menu on smaller screen and thus moves out of the screen. You can easily see this by just making your browser window smaller.

Also on my phone elements of the menu start moving over each other.

The pictures and the YouTube are also not (completely) responsive. Especially the YouTube frame is about twice the width of my screen. This is fixable, just need to add some code to force YouTube to play nice with Bootstrap.

I'd also reconsider the buildup on smaller screens of the IfLoop main screen as the content at the left side stay there and makes it the main content on the right hard to read when the screen gets smaller. I'd stack those two sides on top of each other on smaller screens.

Good luck!";;

Why on earth would they spend 8 dollars on an app when there's so much information available for free? You basically reinvented scratch as an app.;;
"How it is a reinvented of scratch? IfLoop is very different from Scratch. IMHO, I haven't found an app like IfLoop on PC/Mac and app store and google play yet. 

In fact, the predecessor of IfLoop is Piapia language, which is invented at about from 2009 Oct. to 2010 Feb, much earlier than the the language Blockly, which is used in Scratch.";;
"Blockly is a derivative of Scratch, not the other way around.
Scratch is based on the Squeak VM, which in turn is based on Smalltalk, which was first popular in 1980.

I don't know how unique ifloop is, but claiming it's different from scratch because it's older isn't really a good argument.

While I'm here, naming a teaching language after a common beginner's misconception bothers me just a bit.  Still, I'm looking forward to it, and I'll look into it. 

Incidentally, there is aa free version of Scratch on IOS now called Pyonkee.  ";;
"surely, I didn't claim IfLoop is different from scratch because it's older than scratch. I just claim IfLoop is not a reinvented of scratch. They are quite different。

I'm sorry I made the mistake by thinking Scratch is based on Blockly.

In my opinion, the feeling of IfLoop is smoother than Scracth programming, surely, this may be an opinion with bias.
";;
I haven't used ifloop yet, but I'll take a look at it.  I've taught with Scratch for years (as well as traditional languages) and the features of ifloop look interesting. I'm also the tech columnist for a homeschool magazine so I may want to review it.  I already did a feature on Scratch.;;

"The simplest build system is a shell script. No partial rebuilds, but it will build the software. There are some build systems (like fabricate) which work around this concept and add memoisation based on the dependencies of the commands it detects (no need to manually specify dependencies).

In fact, the hard part of build systems is not really keeping track of which commands you need to re-run, it's collecting all the necessary dependencies, includes, and configurations for whatever random system it may need to be built for. This is the kind of thing which causes the most suffering for people trying to build your software.";;
"
You can't exactly create variables like that, but you can do something similar by using a [Map](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Map.html) to associate values with keys (where the ""key"" is your ""variable name""). In fact, you might even be able to use the [Properties class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Properties.html) to read your steam.styles file and put each key/value pair in the map. For example: 

    Properties prop = new Properties();

    File file = // the steam.styles file
    try (InputStream in = new FileInputStream(file);) {
        prop.load(in);
    }
    
    String fontName = prop.getProperty(""basefont"");
    String fontSize = prop.getProperty(""font-size"");




";;
"Well, there are two immediate ways to solve it that i can think of:

You can build a dictionary (HashMap) and add key-value pairs to that. You can then extract the values when you need them, by providing the name.

The more correct way, if the structure is always the same, is to define a class with all the variables you need and then assign them when loading from the file. You can then change the values on the object and write them back to the file when you are done.";;
"What you're doing is bad practice, it'll lead to a bunch of loops and conditional spaghetti code you'll have to run on startup.

It'd be better to just make a database, or use an XML, or JSON file to store these values it'll be just as easy to edit. ";;
I recommend any class of Allardice, he's phenomenal. If it's free, take advantage of it. Take a lot of similar overlapping things and don't worry that you're being inefficient because you'll actually be hearing different things and similar things told different ways, repetition is necessary, and you need to be absorbing context, much like absorbing culture. So the more times/ways you hear stuff explained, the better your mental framework will start to coalesce and the faster things will click. ;;
"I loved that particular lesson from Mr. Allardice. I watched the whole thing and absorbed a lot from it. I really enjoyed the pace and the way he explained everything. It was a general overview of programming and some basics on popular languages. 

I unfortunately did not go further with Lynda.com due to current money issues but hopefully I can continue my subscription in the future. Give the free trial a shot and see if you like it.

You should be learning loops on like day 2...;;
Loops are usually after the first week or after second, since it is important to learn variables and conditions, so when it comes down to loops it shouldn't be too bad. This is how I remember I learned them from class.  ;;
I learned iteration and recursion on day 2 of CS101, but I suppose that's atypical. ;;
"Well, I think it depends on the instructor and school.  
Half the time in the intro-courses they didn't want recursion, but talked about it.  
I think we learned about Iteration by examples by the second week, but wasn't required for assignments until like the 5th week, but alot of the time we were limited to certain things.

"Hello, 

As a fellow beginner, I would advise you to start with another language. Java seems pretty cumbersome as a first language.

I would recommend starting with python or c++ or even javascript if you are just trying to learn the basics. :)";;
Ohh it was Javascript i mean sorry;;
There are tons of good Javscript books out there. Don't go cheap and and buy bad books. You'll waste too much time that way. ;;
"I'm going to have to be ""that guy"" and say that C++ is *at least* as difficult as Java for beginners. Stick with JS, OP";;
you are missing a colon after the second function definition, at the end of line 8;;
Oh, thank you. I am not familiar with Python , the syntax is way different from other languages ( like C++ ) , so it gets kinda confusing sometimes, heh. But thank you very much.;;
"As they said, you miss a "":"" on line 8, next time try to run your code with cmd+B and the console will tell you where your syntax is failing.";;
"I believe this is your problem:

    buffer[original] == '\0';

This statement does nothing - it compares the value of buffer[original] with '\0' and then discards the result.

You probably wanted to use = here. When I make this change, I don't get the random characters. I would recommend enabling as many compiler warnings as you can - my compiler pointed this line out immediately.

In addition, you haven't made it clear why your buffers are 81 characters long. Such ""magic numbers"" should be avoided - use a constant variable or #define instead. You also don't check to make sure you're not writing past the end of the buffer - so this code can potentially overflow. I would also recommend changing that for loop to a while loop - for loops are for when you know how many iterations you want beforehand- if you're looping until some condition is true and you don't know before the loop executes how many iterations that is, a while loop is more readable.

";;
"Thanks a lot for the explanation and the suggestions! I hate to keep making such a basic mistake. 

Refering to the length of the buffers, my C book said that 80 is the standard length of line of text, plus the null character, so I use it by default, but you're right nonetheless.

In any case, I usually write just the most essential stuff to make the program work, then add anything necessary to avoid bugs or security risks.";;
This is a sensible choice of buffer size, but it would still be better to #define STRING_BUFFER_SIZE 81, with a comment explaining the choice of value, to make clear where it comes from - lots of numeric literals in code can become confusing if it's not immediately clear why a certain value was chosen, and if you decided you wanted to change that value, you'd have to try and track down every place where it occurs. I've had cases where I'd written code which used the same number in different places for different reasons. Then I wanted to change one of them, and I had to read through and try and work out which number means what.;;
"    buffer[original] == '\0';

That's probably not right.

It did fail for me - I think that because there's no null terminator, it's reading past the end of the buffer, and you just happen to have a 0 byte there, so you don't see the error.;;

"Computer engineering is more hardware related, specifically programming of or for that hardware.

Take a look at the upper level class requirements for each, I think you'll see some obvious differences.";;
i kind of figured CE was more hardware-oriented, but that's pretty much the only clue i could get from looking at the course listings, they're kind of vague. Thank you!;;
It is more hardware but that's the point the redditor is making, if you want to design hardware (which includes the intersection of drivers, assembly, and operating system), then go CE. If you want to do webpages, apps, servers, check computer science. Bith include some programming but at different layers.;;
Yeah I was leaning cs because I was more interested in app development, which I *thought* was what I needed, but wasn't sure exactly what ce consisted of. Thanks a lot !;;
I majored in CE, and I would say it gave me more of a hardware background than focusing on hardware.  If you're not interested in it, go CS but there's still plenty of software involved in CE, such as embedded software and operating systems;;
CS is more closely related although both computer science and computer engineering majors are fully capable of getting software engineering jobs.;;
Went to art school. Self taught. I'd hazard to say I'm a better software engineer than many graduates with a degree in CS from state schools that I've worked with.;;
This is cool to hear. Thanks for having the confidence/awareness to say as much.;;
Yeah I plan on learning on my own quite a bit. The degree is mainly for employers to see;;
"As an electrical/computer engineer, I'm biased to say that Computer Engineering is better (TM)! At least at my school, it's a lot more rigorous in terms of traditional math and knowledge of hardware and basic electric circuits and low-level things, so I think it could be a boon if you plan to do more than *just* programming. Right now, I'm in a bioinformatics internship in R and I work a side job with an old dialect of Lisp, so I'm confident in saying that a computer engineering degree might be better for me. Think about it; many people can learn programming and do projects off the internet, but how many people can do the same with electric components and circuitry? Actually, quite a lot. Now, how about both? JACKPOT!!!

`#bias`";;
Was it difficult to find work in bioinformatics? ;;
Actually, I got the internship because of a chance connection to one of my EE professors. It's kind of nice!;;
"If programming is what your interested in, do CS. If you have any curiosity or interest in circuit design, or other electronics topics you may want to consider Cpe. But it also can depend a lot on how your school structures ea program.

I did CpE and came to the conclusion that the Electronics aspect of the degree didn't appeal much to me. If I'd have to redo it I would do CS.";;
They are largely the same major except for  a few classes.  CS is a bit more geared towards programming. ;;
"You didn't create the project properly.  It's expecting you to use precompiled headers but you're not doing that.

To create a project properly: New -> Project -> Win32 Console application -> Next -> Uncheck Precompiled header and SDL, and check Empty Project -> Finish.  Now right click on Source Files and do Add -> New Item -> main.cpp (or whatever you want to call the file.)

And get rid of this `keep_window_open()` garbage.  The way you do that is by running the program as Start Without Debugging (Ctrl-F5).  If you do that the console will automatically pause when the program is finished.

The book expects you to use that `std_lib_facilities.h` header, so don't skip that.

Having enough linux experience to be able to install stuff like databases and http servers is really helpful when you're interviewing for a job.;;

"Once you learn 1 DB language, you pretty much know them all (same with oop)

Learning linux is something I think everyone should do. Same with learning Windows and OSX. Increasing your familiarity with operating systems increases your marketability (imo). 

But /u/JBlitzen is correct, you don't need Linux to learn DBs. Buy yourself ( or find ) a resource on Database Management Systems if you're really interested in it. mySQL is a free implementation of SQL. If you really want to just get into a DB environment, Oracle offers a free DBMS (called XE i believe)  that you can run queries against using SQL developer. W3schools as tutorials on DBs also. 

Again, learning Linux is not a prereq or anything, but if you're interested in it, I would totally do it. Linux is awesome, when it works :).";;
"> Once you learn 1 DB language, you pretty much know them all (same with oop)

You mean that when you learn one SQL dialect you can easily switch to another. There are loads of databases with different languages that are very much unlike SQL (Cypher is a good example).";;
"> You mean that when you learn one SQL dialect you can easily switch to another. There are loads of databases with different languages that are very much unlike SQL (Cypher is a good example).

yes.";;
Thanks, I am currently working on learning python and was thinking of some ideas where I can learn some SQL along side it. Then I remembered my old pc and thought I could make it a server of sorts and store stuff on it and make programs that work with the stuff I  store there. And then I had the thought of learning Linux with all that.;;
"Do it, that sounds like a fun project.

I am currently learning Python myself. I know Oracle's implementation of SQL, so I was going to setup some VMs and get Apache running with PHP5 so I could do something. Not quite sure what just yet, but if the idea is there, you're miles ahead of most :).";;
I wouldn't say that. I have a desire to learn but no good direction. I have considered pulling my GI Bill out and going to the local community college about CS classes. ;;
"I think a lack of direction is better than no direction at all. I am new to programming myself even though I have a masters in Information Systems. Not really sure what I want to do with the ability to program, but just being able to is enough to engage yourself to find something interesting.

Getting a degree in CS would be good (any degree I think is great) because it effectively teaches one to learn on their own (not saying you can't learn on your own without one, but it makes it easier). 

You should check out codeacademy if you haven't already. Also there is the FAQ for the subreddit. 

I think the problem most people have is  they expect to know what they will need to know and how to do it before learning anything. But to learn something, you need to know something or you're wasting your time!

So, lets say, you're interested in Linux/Programming right? But you don't know what exactly you want to do? The only ways I can see how one could figure this out is: 1. Go to school and maybe find someone there to talk to about it. 2. Play with it until you find something interesting.

1. Costs a bunch but will probably expedite the process.

2. Is free, but might take time.

I would suggest, if you're able to get someone to pay for the degree, get it, while at the same time, read a bunch about what it is that interests you in order to build some kind of plan within yourself. You don't need to know everything, you just need to know something and you'll be on your way to learning more things. 

If you *really* want to learn linux (even at a very basic level), then I would suggest the following: Download virtualbox (free VM software), install some linux, then do all of your computer things inside of linux for a month. If you don't know how to download something, google, and you'll learn from that. Of course you should also read something about it, but don't try to learn it all in one day, you'll just get frustrated.

Also, look into the LPI-1 certification. They have materials online for free. LPI is just Linux+ (CompTIA's certification). 

It really just comes down to one wanting to know how to do something on the computer and putting in the research to get the absolute tip-of-the-iceberg which will be the catalyst for them to get more involved. For example, I wanted to play computer-games with friends over the internet when I was 13. Now I have a Masters in Information Systems, and am good with TCP/IP networking.";;

"Game AI and real AI are quite different things.

Game AI is basically a set of rules written that your bot will follow. Like how a blackjack dealer always hits if they are below 17. If you like to write rules, try https://codecombat.com/

Real AI is more about Machine Learning. You give the program a goal, and *it* comes up with the rules of its behavior. It's rarely used in games because it makes for poor storytelling. If you like to learn about how you learn, try http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/";;
So I have a follow up question then. What about the Super Mario AI early featured. Was that an example of Game AI where the program was following rules? Or was that an example of true AI. As I saw it the program itself came up with the rules, but there could also be user input telling it the rules. So I guess it was a hybrid? I'm interested in learning to do something similar to that;;
That's a game *playing* AI, which falls more into the latter category. If you're interested in that kind of thing, start with something real simple like TicTacToe or Nim. There's also a [chess programming wiki](https://chessprogramming.wikispaces.com/Programming) that has lots of good resources.;;

There will always be employers who won't care about your appearance. But the reality is that modifying your appearance in a non mainstream way will reduce your chances at getting a good stable job. So, your gauges will be a risk. If you're OK with having to work extra hard at finding a good job to compensate for your reduced employability then go for it. But 15 years from now when you're married, with a mortgage, and raising a child, a higher chance at landing a good job might be more valuable than making a personal statement.

"This is a pretty simple program. Shouldn't take more than a couple lines. If you contact me tommorrow evening in European time I can do this for you with programming language you want (either run in browser or run in terminal/cmd).

If you want to try it yourself heres what you need to do:

- 6 or more variables storing integers. Preferably in an array or list.

- A function where you can input values to your variables.

- function that lowers the time in each timer. All languages have some get system time in milliseconds function. In pseudocode it would look like this:


    int systemTimeLastUpdate;

    while(currentSystemTimeInMilliseconds - systemTimeLastUpdate > 1000){
         for(int timer in timers){
              timer-=1;
        }
    }

- a function that parses all timers in proper format and prints them on screen. Most languages have some kind of time parsing function that turns seconds into hours/minutes/seconds format.

Good luck. Or contact me.

Depends what you allow the scripting engine to do. Generally if it's a scripting language for a game you shouldn't allow it to access the host system or make system calls directly, you just provide an API for working with the game engine.

Too powerful APIs: Since you as the developer register API functions at the interpreter object, you have to make sure those can't do harmful stuff like accessing the file system etc. The same applies to the standard library, which you apparently can [sandbox](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1224708/how-can-i-create-a-secure-lua-sandbox).

2. Bytecode exploitation: That's simple to solve. Make the distribution of user content based on Lua source text; don't load the foreign bytecode. Because the VM expects flawless bytecode in the right order to keep the VM in the right state.

3. Errors in source code. For example, the user should always have a possiblity to halt scripts that run endless loops. Also a crash shouldn't kill your game process. You'd want good warning messages and debugging tools, btw.

All of those points apply to other (embedded) programming languages as well, of course.";;
Thanks for all the great tips and the link! Appreciated.;;
"Lua and JavaScript are easy choices for this. They don't implicitly import any libraries that have access to the outside environment, so they start out sandboxed to within your application.

You still need to take care that any symbols or libraries you do allow your scripters to access can't be used to manipulate outside the program's environment.";;
"You should be able to do this; for instance, World of Warcraft uses LUA for add-ons, and add-ons are generally innocuous (so your computer can't get compromised, although your WoW character/account might be :P, if, for instance, the add-on deletes all your items) .

You should just make sure that whatever you do, the way your game handles the LUA script doesn't allow it to touch anything external.

As an example, Warcraft III once had a vulnerability where a specially crafted custom map could install viruses on your computer (although this doesn't have to do with LUA, and has more to do with how War3 handles custom maps)  (lots of links if you google them; e.g. [\[1\]](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/9.109909-ATTENTION-WarCraft-III-3-Players-Dangerious-exploit-found))";;
"> Warcraft III once had a vulnerability where a specially crafted custom map could install viruses on your computer

Yeah this is what I am afraid of. That I miss something. I have programmed for couple years now and think I'm starting to be pretty decent at that. I'm not a security specialist or a hacker though so I might miss something. I don't want to get myself of any possible clients in trouble if I overlook something.";;
"That's most likely because Warcraft III is written in C++ and C++ lets all sorts of bad things happen if you aren't careful with the code.

C# avoids a bunch of security issues by design due to its high-level memory management.";;
"Oh yes. That is true. You can however write C inside C# as ""unsafe code"" but I think in Unity it's locked as default.";;
"I assume the map was exploiting a buffer overrun (very common attack vector for C or C++ programs).  You won't have the problem with Lua.  It's absurdly well vetted by real wold apps and no such exploits should be possible via Lua code.

You have complete control over what APIs are exposed to the end user, so just make sure nothing that allows manipulation of machine is included (e.g. the `os` and `io` libraries).";;
"Yes. So be careful and secure it well.

"I'm not impressed. I only checked out two pages, so this may be a bit premature, but bad information is bad information regardless of sample size.

The answer to the question ""[Q: What're the right forms of main()?](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/cplusplus_keywords.php)"" is incorrect. (Bonus: what's the mistake and why?)

Also, on [typecasting](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/typecast.php), we see standard misinformation being spread, such as `reinterpret_cast`  making a bitwise copy of data (which is definitely not guaranteed), or `static_cast` only working when an implicit conversion exists (whereas it of course also works for explicit conversions: that's the whole point).

These are just examples; I'm sure they are not the only issues. Writing about C++ is difficult and most online sources are bad. Do yourself a favour and get a good book instead.";;
"Fair enough - maybe he made a few mistakes. However there is no reason why online sources should be bad; it's just as hard to write things in a book as it is online. However many people don't have the option to get a book, so online is all they have.

I do agree though that most online material is outclassed by a good book; I am almost finished with *C++ Primer* and *Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++*. I also plan to read *Effective C++* soon.";;
">Fair enough - maybe he made a few mistakes. However there is no reason why online sources should be bad; it's just as hard to write things in a book as it is online.

No, it's much harder to write a book. You can't just write a few paragraphs and have them magically appear in a bookstore - publishing a book requires a lot of work. *Anyone* can write an online tutorial in an evening.

C++ is really complex language, and it's no wonder that no one who actually knows the language wants to write a tutorial for free.

>However many people don't have the option to get a book, so online is all they have.

Why couldn't they get a book? You can easily order one online no matter where you live. If someone really can't get a book anywhere (like if they're underage and can't order stuff online), I would recommend them to learn another programming language. There *are* good free online tutorials for other languages, such as Python or Java.";;
"Not impressed either.  Just opening a few random ones:

* [""Pointers have a close relationship with arrays. In fact, an array name is a constant pointer to the first element of the array.""](http://www.bogotobogo.com/cplusplus/pointers2_voidpointers_arrays.php)
* Same place: ""We're not allowed dereference void pointer: Why not? 
Because we don't know the type, we don't know how many bytes we should embrace from the memory. Should we get 1 byte, 2 bytes, or 4 bytes?"" The size is the least of your concerns!

"It depends a lot by what you mean with ""games"". There may be little game projects that may help at the beginning. Like little text adventures, hangman, simple tamagotchis or stuff like that. But if you're talking about some real games, then I would go with: No, too complex for a beginner.";;
"Some simple game programming is certainly a good medium to learn how to code: It's fun and you can play with your own projects. There are several books available for learning how to program through coding games and probably even more online tutorials you can start out with.

Any kind of programming, regardless of what field it's in or what field you end up in professionally, is great practice and will help you learn and improve. 

Depending on your learning style (whether you like reading, or watching videos, or doing hands-on examples online), you'll want to check out the FAQ for /r/learnprogramming for a lot of great resources. Also, you're guaranteed to find plenty of simple game-coding tutorials with a Google or YouTube search.

Hope that helps.

EDIT: I also had the URL to this [free PDF of Python game programming](https://inventwithpython.com/inventwithpython.pdf) tucked away in my kitbag. It was one of my first programming reads and I made some cool little projects with it. It looks like this one is up to date with Python 3 too.";;
If you're going for it security then the games will not really teach you much applicable knowledge unless you're doing lots of memory management and security for your games not an easy place for a beginner to be IMO.;;

"I've found that planning is what separates my smaller applications from my larger ones. Figure out what you want your application to do and figure out how you're going to do it before you start to code and you will end up with a reasonable roadmap that you just need to execute.

When you plan in this way you can also come up with internal milestones in which you have an app which can do some cool things but isn't the final product. These milestones can help keep up motivation since you can see the products of your work.";;
"Agreed with this. 

Any of the programming languages you mentioned can be used to build large applications. A good starting point is to figure out a project you want to do, start writing its organization out in plain English/pseudocode, and then dive into coding it.

Or, if you want to start with someone else's large app and work your way up to your own, look up some open source projects that have already been done and do some tinkering or build upon them. There are also more than a few programming books that allow you to build/add onto a large application throughout each chapter.

Whatever you decide to do, make sure you pick something fun and exciting that will keep you motivated to keep going.";;
"Seconding/Thirding everything said in the two comments above.

One thing to remember is that you'll often end up rewriting large sections of the code even if you plan things in-depth. As you go you'll continue to learn more and you'll notice that code you've previously written needs to be rewritten. 

Don't get discouraged with however long it takes.";;
"At some point, an application becomes too large to fit into a single person's head.

There are many moving parts, lots of interconnected components, layers and interfaces - and the only way to cope with this is to impose rules on how you work.

So you want to implement A, but a depends on B and C and if you change C then D changes too and that means that E & F need refactoring... STOP. If you ever find yourself in this situation, you need to lay down some ground rules.

* Use Interfaces to abstract behavior. An object has a contract that it agrees to satisfy - this saves you headspace and prevents accidental misuse.

* Keep your variables private. You need to trust that things stay where you put  them when you add new behavior. Don't make it possible for other objects to use you for their storage.

* Shared mutable state considered harmful. Everyone knows not to use globals, but they won't bat an eye at declaring a public static variable.

* Magic is bad. Like when a function runs because you imported a module, or if someone is monkey patching objects at runtime.

If these rules aren't followed, a tool like a compiler should get you to fix it. Python does all of the above very badly, so try to pick a language that doesn't let get you into bad habits out of the box.

There are lots of other ways to fit a large project in your head, but it comes down to trust. Trust that an object will honor it's interface contact. Trust that the libraries you are using will do what they advertise and *only* what they advertise. Trust that the pile of code you wrote your code on has some basic quality standards, and suddenly writing big apps isn't so hard.";;

Google Rex Egg. A great site;;
"    /metis.*\.egg$/

To Explain

    /.../ = usually, regex expressions are written like that.
    . = any character.
    * = repeat what was previous 0 or more times.  
    .* = whatever for any length
    matis.* = matis then whatever
    \ = escaping character
    \. = a dot. Because without the escaping character it would mean any character.
    \.egg = "".egg""
    $ = the end. Could be the end of the line, of the file or of a string. It depends.
    \.egg$ = must end in "".egg""
    metis.*\.egg$ = ""metis"", then whatever for any length, ending with "".egg""

Also fyi

    ^ = at start.
    /^metis.egg$/ matches only ""metis.egg"", since the start is before it and the end after it.
    /metis.egg/ should match anything that contains ""metis.egg""
    Those above depends on with what you are using the regex, tho.
    
    () = grouping
    haa*! = ha!, haaaaa!, haaaaaaaaa! etc
    ha(ha)*! = ha!, hahaha!, hahahaha!
    ha+! = same as haa*!.
    (ha)+! = same as ha(ha)*!
    [] = letter choice
    (h[ae])+! = haha!, hahe!, heha!, hahahaha!
    a|b = a OR b
    (h(a|e))+! = same as (h[ae])+!
    (ha|he)+! = same as (h[ae])+!
    ? = matches zero or one time.
    ha(ha|he)*!? = ha, ha!, hahe!, hahehaha!, hehehehehe
    escaping ?:
    ha(ha|he)*\? = ha?, hahe?, hahehaha?

And finally

    \number = what the group NUMBER has matched.
    (ha|he)\1*! = ha!, haha!, hahaha!, he!, hehe!, hehehe!
    if (ha|he) matches (ha) then \1 is (ha). Otherwise it is (he).";;
Even with practice, I still open the regex documentation for my language when I need to use them;;
It gets better with time;;
"My two cents: The way I have picked up RegEx so far is to just choose to use it all the time in your editor/IDE. Anytime I need to make an edit on any small amount of lines I use Ctrl+F and use RegEx to to find/replace some some text. Some IDE's, like NetBeans, will actually highlight the pieces your regex is catching. Very quick way to start getting the hang

The regex will look a little different depending on if you want to ""capture"" a part of the strings you're looking for:

To simply find the strings:

    ^\S*metis\S*\.egg$

For capturing, if you wish to replace text, use the () around the part you wish to capture, and each captured group can be referenced in order by $1, $2, .... etc";;

"First of all, you should know that game design is not game development.

It's a completely different set of skills.

Game designers are not required to be expert programmers. 

Ideally, you want to have basic proficiency in all areas of production and pre-production, as well as working knowledge of all the tools used in them. As a designer, you should be able to build working prototypes - not polished, bug-free, optimized products.

So, if game *design* is your goal, then you don't need to learn C++ at all. Learn to use 2D/3D animation software, learn about UI and UX design, step up your organizational skills, become a Visio/Excel guru, and most importantly, learn to use modern prototyping tools like Unity or Unreal Engine. A scripting language like lua will come in handy - or basic knowledge of C# for Unity.

If you have dreams of working for Valve or Blizzard, you must be no less than magical with their own tools (Hammer/Galaxy). 

Now, if what you want is to be a programmer for games, then C++, C#, and Java are the 3 most widespread languages I believe - although many game companies also need programmers for other things than the actual game engines, like back-end and testing tools, networking, websites and web/mobile apps, etc. ";;
Java is rarely used in game development. The only big game I can think of that's written in it is the PC version of Minecraft. The other versions were re-written in C++.;;
Lots of games now use C# too, especially indie games.;;
For sure because of the proliferation of unity, it's a really handy language to know if you are looking at the indie side of things.;;
XNA games too.;;
Unfortunately, XNA is no longer being updated.;;
What a shame, Magicka and Terraria both used XNA and they were fantastic games.;;
Notch's version of Minecraft should not serve as an example of good game programming.;;
I don't agree or disagree, but I'd be super interested to hear why you think that. I haven't looked at his code, just others inspired by it, and it seems fine, but I'll readily admit my own ignorance.;;
Notch was a game designer first, and a programmer a distant second.  While he was able to creating a working version of the game in Java, he used data structures and techniques that were horribly inefficient and overly robust.  Most notably, he made every block an object instance, so once the world was generated too far, memory would overflow and the world would go haywire.  This bug was fixed after Notch was removed from programming duties.;;
This is probably a silly question, but I'm not an experienced programmer by any means: what would be a better way to keep track of all of the blocks, their location and state, etc? I realize how each block being a separate object instance would get out of hand really fast, but I can't think of a good substitute off the top of my head.;;
In Java, I'm drawing a blank, too.  Haven't used the language in some time.  Had Notch used C++ instead, he could've used structs, which are better for holding data values.;;
"> Java is rarely used in game development.

Honestly I don't think this matters when it comes to learning game development. Java is fast and multiplatform, and it has some really nice game libraries like LibGDX that makes learning how to make a game really easy.

"I work for a company that makes slot machines. The designer gives us a massive spreadsheet with all the biases of everything and the expected results. 

We press a button which outputs the spreadsheet's data into text files which our games can read (which are eventually the logic tables that make it into production, once the designer approves), and then we have to make sure the results from our tests match the expected results in the spreadsheet.

I imagine in other types of games there's a lot of behind the scenes logic that could not be done without a spreadsheet.";;

Java or Javascript? Because I ran into this problem of starting to learn Java for Unity and finding out they were different things.;;

Other than the name they don't really have anything to do with each other.";;
"I know... I figured out that out about 30 hours in.

"> Other than the name they don't really have anything to do with each other.

It's true that Javascript is not intentionally related to Java in any way -- the naming was a marketing ploy by Netscape -- but they have slightly more *in common* than just name, e.g. they are both pointerless, garbage collected languages that use C-like syntax (though JS is semantically much closer to Lua than Java, despite the former having Pascal-like syntax), and Javascript was used (among other things) to script Java applets.";;
"Well, sure, and Ham and Hamster have more in common than just the name -- for instance, both are made out of meat, both are not vegetables, both can provide comfort to humans...

What they have in common is pretty arbitrary. JavaScript has more in common with Python and Ruby than it does with Java.";;
Java, not JS. JS is a scripting language for the web. You *can* make games with it, but since I think you're talking about games like Terraria, XCOM, and Arma, you'd want to learn Java (at least out of those two options).;;
"Well, you *could* try to make those things on the Web -- it gets closer to being a viable platform to ship games on every day, I'm pretty sure Terraria would work well. As a bonus, people wouldn't have to install Java and make sure to say no to the fucking Ask Toolbar.

But yeah, Java is pretty different than JS, and there are some pretty big limits to what you can do with each.";;
I'm not saying you couldn't do those things with it, I was just trying to illustrate that they are two different tools designed for completely different applications. You could do these things in assembly or Python, its just a matter of what would be easier/perform better.;;

C#;;
You can use three languages: C#, Javascript and Boo. ;;
That last one is too scary for most;;
It uses JavaScript too, and is designed to be more JavaScript oriented. You can use c# or boo though, but, at least for c#, it kind of breaks standard style with Unity's component model.;;
I don't agree it's more JavaScript oriented, there are a few deep functions that are only available in c# (or boo) I think more because of limitations of the language, than not being exposed. ;;
Well when I was using the latest unity, when you click create new script, the two options it gave you were C# or something with java in its name. And then a unity developer told me it was Javascript, after I'd already gotten decently far into Java.;;
if you're wanting to go with unity you learn c#, its the most documented and used within the unity 3d world. If you want to use unreal engine then you'd learn c++ as that's the most well documented and most widely used in that community.;;
"To directly answer your question, I believe ACDMBR meant Java, although I'm not aware of many big name games programmed in Java except for Minecraft.

That said, if you're starting out, you can use Java for game development and you can use JavaScript for game development, and it really won't really make a difference which one you learn, as the skills you develop in one can easily translate to the other if years down the road you find out you need to switch for whatever reason.

At my job, we use Java and JavaScript together in our development of the same product, for example.";;
Hmm I just was so focused on it because Unity seemed like a good place to start learning, and when I was doing the tutorials I decided I wanted to delve more into coding so I would feel more comfortable, And I just vaguely remembered that besides C# ( Which wasn't on CodeAcademy) that I thought Java was used as well. So that's why I started learning it XD;;
Java and C# are pretty similar, so you're in luck if you stick with Unity.;;
Java isn't actually that common in game development, other than on Android. Something like Lua might be more useful.;;
"C++ is definitely the most used programming language for video games, but if you are looking to start, you can make some simple games with Python. Here's a book to get you started: http://inventwithpython.com/chapters.

Also, the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_can_i_get_started_making_video_games.3F) is a good place to go for these type of questions.";;
Wiki has the answers!;;
This is how I started.. Highly recommend it.;;
Doesn't the FAQ on this sub says that if you're looking to learn C++  and Python, is recommended to start with C++ first? Do you know why that might be the reason? ;;
C++ is a LOT more difficult than python. If Python isn't your thing, you could also try to learn C#, which shares a lot of concepts/syntax elements with C++ but doesn't require you to deal with more advanced topics like pointers, memory allocs/delete and destructors half as much. C# is also compatible with Unity 3D, which is a really nice +.;;
But if you'd were to start with C++, where do you start to program games? Do you use something like Eclipse and work on basic platformers? I'm also taking the C++ route, because the C++ language appealed to more than C# or Python.;;
"Eclipse is a development environment - think of it as a text editor with lots of nice features. You could use it or any other number of things like Vim, Code Blocks, Visual Studio and so on. If you have Eclipse already installed and you're familiar with it, then yeah, go with that for now.

As for where you go from there, check out SDL or SFML for how to get the graphical aspect if your game going (there are tons of resources available online).";;
Personally I'm a big fan of Visual Studio for C based languages. It's great for beginners and can be customized as you get more advanced. ;;
woa woa woa, no Visual Studio should only be used after you've gained enough knowledge to understand compiler dependent syntax, VS compiler allows you to do too many things you really shouldn't be able to do and does a lot of platform specific things. Start with no IDE, then move on to what ever you want, but never start off with VS with out sufficient knowledge. ;;
Really? Because I was taught on visual Studio and I have never had a problem with it. I just didn't touch stuff I didn't understand. Left everything as default until I learned more. It worked really well for me and I felt like the environment grew with me as I learned more. ;;
"If you haven't, I would recommend you start doing some minor project developed on linux, and learn how to use Makefiles to build your project, you will start to understand what actually goes into the arguments for compiling C++, how easy it is to develop on linux and at the same time how restricted you are in using the VS compiler (you can use GCC as well on VS, I think at least)  

From what you've said here it seems like you are only using it for the familiarity, and what is actually happening behind the scenes is being abstracted for you. ";;
if you are a complete beginner i don't know if i would recommend learning about compilers at the beginning. I think starting with visual studio is a good idea, and once you start to learn what coding is about, you can get into learning how to compile, make makefiles, etc.;;
Sweet! I'll just get busy with SFML, and read some decent C++ books meanwhile. Thanks alot for the insight.;;
XNA used be a great starting point, and was actually where I started coding anything resembling a game. However after it being disbanded it's a little less clear cut. (Which is unfortunate because I love C#'s style) Monogame is now a viable replacement for XNA but can be a little harder to set up correctly, especially for beginners. I have taken to using OpenTK (a wrapper for OpenGL, OpenAL, and input) for my projects but I'm still unsure if this tailors itself well to beginners. If you want though you can follow my tutorials I've been working on: [http://www.siltutorials.com](http://www.siltutorials.com);;
First you do all the described steps you can find everywhere to have you up to level on the C++ language, after that, there are some really good books on amazon specific for game dev on c++. I remember reading some in 1994, and they were are also in c++, borland, maybe you weren't even born then :-) Have fun. ;;
"I'm don't know the reason, but I'd guess it's because if you're learning basic programming concepts (declare variables, write a loop, etc), the way C++ does it is similar to a broader range of languages, making skills transfer easier.

However, something to consider is that if your goal is just to design games, not necessarily write all the code yourself, then sure, maybe Python would be an easier route, or you might look into C# since that's what Unity uses.";;
If you're doing Unity, I would still go for c++;;
I'd enjoy seeing your case for that combo.;;
I just think that c++ programmers are better c# programmers when they have to move to the dark side :-);;
They need to build up endurance, c# is incredibly long winded in comparison.;;
"I think you may be referring to [this question](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq_cpp#wiki_should_i_learn_c.2Fpython.2F..._before_learning_c.2B.2B.3F). I wrote this because we get a lot people here asking what the best way to learn C++ is, and whether they should first learn something else when their end goal is learning C++. Then the answer is no: if you want to learn C++, do that.

However, if you want to get into game design, learning Python will get you working on games faster. If you still want to learn C++, that's fine, but just learning it because you want to make games is not the best reason. Other languages can do that just fine.";;
Yeah, I kind of figured there would probably be other better options for beginners, since C++ sounds like a language that you would learn once you were already familiar with programming.;;
No, I don't agree. Power comes with a price ;-);
"Because Python is easier than C++, it allows you to not even have to think about all the memory allocation that you'd have to do in languages like C/C++. If you learn C/C++ then go to Python the world will be super easy to you, if you go from Python to C/C++ you'll hate how complicated the world will seem.

Honestly for games, I think what's most popular for indie devs is C# and Java though. Just saying. Automatic garbage collection and near C/C++ speeds.";;
"Python would be MUCH easier to grasp than C++ for you. The syntax is a lot more forgiving and a lot of stuff is done for you. You can make more things happen in less lines with a syntax where less can go wrong. 

";;
tl;dr version: C++ doesn't leave a lot of room for bad habits. ;
Wait, what?  C++ is notorious for people having abhorrent habits.  It's half the reason web tutorials tend to be so discouraged; other languages just don't have the room to fuck up your understanding of the language so badly.;
"I believe you misunderstood his comment and that you're both trying to say the same thing.

I interpreted  'C++ doesn't leave a lot of room for bad habits' to mean that C++ can be a very powerful tool if used properly, but that the mastery required to wield that power properly makes it a bad choice for beginners.

Scripting languages, however, could be said to 'leave room for bad habits' because they abstract away some of the lower level features that you might otherwise get with a language closer to the metal.";;
you'd want to learn c++ because then you get an idea of what low level development which means you'll see more of what the computer is actually doing where in python you won't really know what some of what the computer is doing behind the scene. c++ is also a compiled language which runs faster than an interpreted language such as python. c++ is more ideal for game development.;;
The FAQ is wrong, learn Python first.;;
The FAQ is wrong, we should have all learned C and Assembly first. Only because I did, so SHOULD YOU!! :-) ;;
Actually, you're all wrong, I recommend learning how to use punch cards before beginning any of that. ;;
Unfortunately, I had to learn that too. ;;
It's got nothing to do with me, it's objectively easier as a learning path. ;;
"I think unity is good place to start using C#. It is a game engine but it has a lot of good videos on programming in it. Plus it will export to the desktop like a c++ application, but also to mobile which I don't think a C++ application would. 

When I started I just sat and watched videos and learned a lot. Then I dove in.

C++ may be better since you will just be learning programming and not a game engine as well but I think you would be better off in unity. 
[Here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules) are some videos so you can see what it does.

I would check out the editor section at the bottom first, then some others,  and then move on to the scripting when you are comfortable with what it does.";;
Game design is completely separate from game programming.  You should learn logic and English if you want to be a good game designer, and then learn programming languages (start with Python) if you want to be a good games programmer.;;
"You have luckily many resources these days. If you go the c++ route you can use sfml which is really damn good. Unreal engine also uses c++. Unity uses c#, which is also pretty good. I would actually encourage processing if you want to just get the very basic idea of game (game loops, etc) and then migrate to a much better solution later on. 

What languages do you have any expirence with currently? ";;
It's not even that bad to just work with C++ in SFML and check out Unity with C# right? Main focus is on programming anyway. I've got some basic programming knowledge right now. A bit of Java, C# and C++.;;
"It's not bad at all, especially considering Unity ships with visual studio integration, and once you add in the Resharper plugin via a trial you will begin to really flow through their codebase.

Awesome, thanks for helping me out!;;

You talk about game design... but from what you describe its more game development you are talking about.;;
Yeah, I guess I meant game development or game programming.;;
Hey, if you want to start developing games in c++, then chcek out Unreal engine 4;;
Well, i think first of all you need to get a good grasp on c++... it wont help much explaining stuff about some libraries/Frameworks etc... So first of all get c++ basic syntax, and how c++ works(if you really wanna go for c++ , an other option would be Unity/C# which is definitely a lot easier);;
C++ is difficult imo, python as mentioned or learning general programming with Java would be good.;;
Well, thanks for the replies and advice. I think I might go with Python. Do you guys know if is available for Mac and where could I possibly get it?;;
I mean the following in a totally constructive way, but one of the most important skills, perhaps THE most, is learning how to find things on your own. Certain questions are best for forums, like asking advice or when you don't know what something is called. But for a question like this, if your instinct isn't to go straight to google, then you need to learn basic search habits and skills. You'll need them a dozen times a day when you're first starting out, and at least a couple times a day possibly for the rest of your career. ;;
I just thought I'll ask here since we all ready have a discussion going on, but don't worry I know that a lot of the learning process is going to be about how to do research.;;
"Python is already installed on Mac OS. (Python 2.7)  Just open up he terminal and type 'python' and you're in the interactive shell. 

And a question like this (is Python on Mac?  How do I get it?) is easily answered with Google. I only say this because effectively googling stuff IS a valid development skill. ";;
The reason why I asked is because I know Mac has Xcode wich I believe comes with C++ or something like that. I just wasn't sure if it was the same with Python.;;
"Xcode is an IDE, like Eclipse. It is typically used for Objective C, which is what OSX and iOS apps are typically written in. However, Xcode can be used for other things. 

You'll want to make the distinction between languages and tools, as those seem to be muddled up here. C/C++/Obj-C/C#/Python/Ruby/Java/JavaScript/etc. are all languages. There are a multitude of tools which can be used to develop in those languages, but they do not include those languages. (A tool does not 'come with' a language)

I feel like trying to start with Unity is akin to learning how to drive in a Formula 1 car. It's really jumping into the deep end. All of the tools and modules there just add massive complexity to what you're trying to learn. Grab something like Learn Python the Hard Way or How to Think Like a Computer Scientist and start there. Get the basics solid, and then you can build on them. ";;
Python 2.7 comes preinstalled, but it's *probably* a good idea to learn on 3.x; a simple Google search will lead you to the latter.;
"Okay, either game design isn't what you think it is or game development isn't.  
The people who contribute content to games generally come in three categories: programmers, who make the tools that go into the game; artists, who make the assets that communicate the game; and designers, who use those tools and assets to craft the game experiences.  
A programmer needs to know C++. It's a language of dubious quality but it's fast and it's versatile and it's the industry standard.  
A designer needs to know whatever simpler scripting language the programmer's tools take. Often this is some derivative of Lua or Javascript, though in Unity you can also use the more fully-featured C#.  
If you actually want to be a programmer, learn C++. If you want to be a designer, pick up a game production suite like Game Maker Studio or Unity and learn their scripting languages (Game Maker Language and C#/UnityScript/Boo respectively), before taking those languages and learning to make an experience using them.";;
"I would start with C++. The concepts you learn coding in C++ will translate to pretty much everything else.

If you mean game development. Yes. It's a rough field, but if you're good, you will learn skills for the rest of your life. ;;
"I'm also going to add something that hasn't really been said here .... in game development outside of indie land, game designers are much smaller in number and have the most people vying for them.

If game making is just the field you want to go into, game art and game programming are FAR FAR more common jobs.";;
[deleted];;
I guess I meant game development or programming. ;;
try [processing](https://processing.org/);;
"Game design is a craft, something to be learned ""quickly"" and honed for the rest of your life.

You don't need to program to learn game design. You can go down to the hobby store, but some pegs, dice, and empty playing cards, and make games on your own. Everything starts with pen and paper. Make a game, test it, discover that it is shit, then make a new one.

If you want to make electronic games for a computer, c++ can be a good goal. Lots of the best games - games that look and play good - require as much of your hardware ' s resources as possible, and C++ has that balance between ""micro managing a computers resources"" and ""I can do amazing things with this!!!""

Ultimately all game designers should learn how to write a program. They don't need to be software engineers, they just need to learn how to make the computer do the things they want with a little bit of code. Nobody can sell a computer game to a publisher just on paper unless they've got a fantastic reputation. If you're a nobody in the industry you'll need a working prototype to show how you want your game to look and feel.

I would not start programming with c++, though. Depending on your background, start with Python or Java first. Python is a fun language to play with, and a few extensions make it really easy to program games, too. Then you can move on to Java and C++, learning about object-oriented architecture, memory management (pointers), data structures, and algorithms along the way.

Good luck, and keep pushing yourself!";;
"I would avoid C++ (to start out anyway) unless you're a masochist and you have an existing codebase to build upon. I started with C++, because I was interested in writing mods for Half Life 2. Probably one of the most difficult routes you can take if you want to actually *implement* a game with a concept you've already got in mind.

As for python, it's great for getting your feet wet for one major reason: The interactive shell. Seriously, it's a super effective way to just quickly figure out what you can and can't do with the language/engine/libraries. And with a 3rd party shell like ipython, you get documentation, autocomplete, and all sorts of other good stuff to help you out.

To get you started, look into Panda3D if you plan to do 3D games, and PyGame if you want to keep things simple and go the 2D route. I've worked with both, and they're pretty easy to get up and running. Blender also has a game engine build in, but that *will* require the full Blender install as a dependency to run the game, which is far from ideal.";;
Shift-F5 works also very fast in your C++ IDE.;;
"I hope you're not referring to seeing if your code works. Visual Studio's compiler output is cryptic as hell if you don't already understand its quirks, especially if you're just learning your first language.

But yes, it's pretty quick to point out invalid code, and you can find the issue equally as fast if you're already familiar with C/++.

Edit: I can't tell if that's debugging or building, the hotkeys have changed wildly between VS releases. ";;
"C++ can be a little difficult (especially if its your first language). It requires extra work on the coders end to do stuff like memory management (something lots of other languages handle for themselves).

I would recommend starting with another language like JavaScript or C#. Once you've gotten the hang of important programming concepts with a simpler language, learning a more complex language won't be quite so difficult.

Also, the reason I recommend JavaScript or C# is that there are some nice game dev tools that use them. Phaser.js is a fairly JavaScript library/game engine for making browser games. And the Unity Game Engine (which is more in the vein of game *design* accepts scripts in both JavaScript and C#.";;

If you mean, is it prudent to use Python to load data into a data warehouse, then the answer is probably yes, but it is hard to say without knowing more details. Python is easy to write and read, a very common skill and handles all types of structured data reasonably well, which is all really helpful when building a data warehouse. 

Have a look at the Luigi library created and open sourced by Spotify. There are a handful of packages like this one that make it incredibly easy to build data pipelines. I like this one because the dependency graph is the code not some separate config file/database.

"If the question is very open-ended, the interviewer probably wants to know more about your experience with coming up with solutions for async operations. That could be the implicit goal of the question. Being able to explain what [callback hell](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25098066/what-is-callback-hell-and-how-and-why-rx-solves-it) is and how to handle it would definitely strengthen your interview.

";;
I'd say it would be good to mention something about asynchronous operations and events. ;;
This example is not wrong, but it doesn't really show [that you understand] why you would ever want to use callbacks.;;
Give this a read. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures;;
One thing I would work out in regards to callbacks is the `this` keyword. During the course of a callback, what context are you in, and who's actually calling? That can change and drastically alter what a callback can do.;;
"As others noted, I guess it depends on your definition of ""callback"", but your example most strongly demonstrates that functions are first-class citizens in javascript.  Just like you can pass integers, floats, strings, objects, arrays, and other stuff as arguments to a function, you can also pass other functions.

Callbacks, as they are used in most places in javascript, are very powerful due to their asynchronous nature.

For instance, you can make an ajax request, and specify a callback that should occur after the ajax request returns.  This callback doesn't get executed until the ajax request returns, which could be 10 seconds later, 20 seconds later, etc.

Or you can make a confirmation panel (""Are you sure? Y"") using your typical third-party UI libraries, and have callback functions that execute conditional on whether the user hits Y or N.

The asynchronous nature of these commands make callbacks necessary, since that's the simplest way to say ""here's a function; don't execute it until I tell you to"".";;
"Your example doesn't really illustrate the (what I believe to be) important part of callbacks. They are very important when you are dealing with functions that run on a separate thread i.e. run at the same time (asynchronously) and you need to wait until the tasks complete before running another bit of code. When the secondary task completes, the callback will be run.

For example, I recently ran into trouble with running multiple queries on a database that uses a max query return limit. I essentially needed to ask for the same data over and over until it dumped out everything I wanted. However using a 'while' loop was giving me errors because it was sending a second query to the database before it could finish processing the first. My initial draft looked like (just demonstration pseudo code):

    while(objectList < intendedAmount) {
        queryDatabase();
    }

I solved the problem by using recursion and a callback from the first query (again just pseudo code):

    public ObjectList getObjectsFromDB(ObjectList objList, Query q){
        
       q.getObjectsWithCallback( callbackFunction() {
               objList.addAll(agreggate)
               
               getObjectsFromDB(objList, q) //recursive call if query was succsessful
       });
    }

Obviously the database has to understand how to deal with callbacks, but you get the gist of the concept. The code within that callback function won't be ran until the database finishes its query and calls it.

Edited after rereading your post and saw that you were indeed using callbacks.";;

"If a website will work for you, you can make this in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Don't worry, it's not as difficult as it sounds. 

If you want mobile apps(since you mention multiple), you can either learn Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android, and C# for Windows Phone, or use PhoneGap and use the same HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build mobile apps that work on all three platforms. 

Your idea sounds like it will need a backend, for which you can use JavaScript or Python. ";;
"I'm not worried about a website and apps just yet. I wanna get an algorithm together first and test it for a bit. If it works well, the I will try to commercialize it and make websites and apps for it. 

So basically what you're saying is that either JavaScript or Python are the best options for the algorithm, am I right?";;
You definitely want to pick the language you will use based on how your program will be deployed. An algorithm's complexity comes from the logic you use to create it; each of the languages can implement that algorithm as easily as the next once it has been designed. ;
I see. Thanks for the the advice!;;
Yes, Python is good for this sort of stuff. However, the algorithm you outline is a machine learning algorithm, which is not something I would recommend you to start with, since you do not know how to program just yet. I would say work on the mobile/web app first and when you have more knowledge with programming, then work on the algorithm.;;
Well, I do know HTML and CSS. But what you say makes sense. Since the algorithm sounds like it'll be a daunting task, how do I know when I'm ready for it?;;
Once you know your language moderately well, you are familiar with the syntax, you've worked with quite a lot of third party libraries and can pick up their APIs with relative ease, I would say you would be ready. Sure, you can work on it before all of the above is true, but it'll be quite a bit more confusing. I tried getting into Machine Learningatural Language Processing before I knew even the syntax of my language well enough, and it all went above my head, but now it isn't quite as daunting.;;
I see. Thank you so much for your help, really appreciate it. ;;
"Split it into parts and work in increments. Look into reading Practical Object Oriented Design by Sandy Metz. It'll help a lot with projects in any language.

Languages are kinda all the same. They each have intended applications and nuances but... they all can benefit from a basic toolkit of design principles and programming paradigms.

Once you get close to finishing your project, then you're ready haha. Honestly... when is anyone ready? Just dive in!";;
"This project is pretty awesome! Makes me feel some type of way that I know a load of programming but couldn't even tell you what a tax return form looks like.

Anyway, for starters, I think you'll want to focus on just simulating the application learning instead of it truly learning. The difference is slight (and I may just be being pedantic), but the difference in complexity is exponential. Having it truly 'learn' and be able to make unpredictable decisions goes into the realm of artificial intelligence. Simulating its ability to learn would be more along the lines of using a vast amount of data to plot complex probability density functions, minimize their confidence intervals, and spit out some best guess cases, which is what I am thinking you meant. If so, then you are essentially doing it already. If you are already number-crunching one blog, it's just a matter of applying that method large-scale, and rehashing that data to be compared, which I'll leave up to you gents (unless you're trying to get someone else on board ;) ). 

When it comes to the webcrawler portion, that I can give some concrete advice. Fortunately for you - and every search engine out there - there are standardized schemas that websites must adhere to if they want to improve their search engine optimization, meaning that every site you're interested in is probably using this format. You can find all the classes and such from their homepage [here](https://schema.org/). Basically, this adds additional information - called microdata - to the elements that you see displayed on a webpage for the specific purpose of categorizing it to allow a web crawler to easily find what it's looking for. Although I've never looked into any web crawler APIs that are out there, I really recommend writing your own. It's not too difficult once you understand the fundamental paradigm behind it, and you will be able to taylor it to your exact needs down the road. I recently wrote a very basic one just to get my feet wet and I'd be more than happy to send it to you if you PM me as it is too large to post here.";;
"I believe that's what we plan to do! But actually you just gave me an idea with probability density functions. Right now, we're purely using the historical turn to calculate expected return, but it might be good to account for probability.

Ideally, we'd like our program to have some good results, so the more chaos we can account for, the better. If the returns on similar blogs vary dramatically, it might be good to account for that and have the computer weigh those results less heavily. 

Anyway, no we don't intend to do any AI at all haha. So far, we have some very rigid models for the computer to follow. It's more about calculus and gradients.

"> If it helps at all, I have impeccable spelling and grammar, and I'm good at learning new languages. I can type 120 words per minute and read 100 pages an hour, and I was decent at math in school.

TBH, none of the above is a criterion for a good programmer.

Programming languages are just tools, knowing a language does not mean that you are able to program.

You can learn a programming language in a relatively short time as it is mainly vocabulary and syntax, but you can not learn *to program* in a short time as this requires lots of practice.

Quick typing is definitely a bonus for becoming a programmer, but it's not a necessity.

Being good at math is also a bonus, but again, maths is a small part of programming so it will not really benefit you too much.

Speed reading is also beneficial so you can skim the elaborate documentations, but again, the ability to *implement* the read material is what counts.

With 15 hours a week, you can learn the language quite fast, but you won't be able to learn to program as quickly.";;
Like all skills, mastering programming will take a lifetime.;;
"I took a university class for nine months on the topic, and we covered perhaps 20% of the language. This was with lectures, questions, weekly homework, etc. I easily spent 10 hours a week on it during that time.

So... perhaps three years? Be sure to get a [good book](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq_cpp). :)";;
"You spent 360 hours and learned 20%, so it would take you 1800 hours. Excellent; if I don't sleep, I can learn it in 2 and a half months. Wish me luck.

";;
"Remember that this was with lessons and feedback on assignments - by yourself it may go a bit more slowly.

But seriously, it's probably the wrong question to ask. To ""master"" something is very very hard and you may have heard of the [10000 hours rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_%28book%29).

Just pick a book best suited to you and get started. You'll be writing programs within a week.";;
Not quite.  If you spend 1800 hours, you can cover the whole language and become reasonably fluent in using the language features.  After that, there's thousands of hours more you've got to put in to become good in writing larger things.;;
I started using C++ in 1998 and have even used it professionally. I am still surprised by how little I know of the language.;;
"Is there a reason, you want to start with C++? It's not an easy to learn language, it has too many subtleties, it is not the most popular language in use. You may find Python better.

Having said that, the skillset you are listing isn't related to coding. Coding is the art of breaking a problem into smaller more concrete steps until it can be described to a machine. Being good at math helps, but with our culture of translating being good at math as being good at arithmetic which isn't really relevant. Learning a computer language is different than learning a human language. Human languages, have working vocabularies of around 3000 words and to be self-sufficient to the point where you can learn independently, you need maybe 500 words. Computer languages have vocabularies or around 20 words.

I feel you are in the very beginner stage where you don't know what questions to ask. I would recommend start going through some very basic programming tutorials. This will give you enough of an understanding to see what is an achievable goal for an independent project.";;
"What do you want to do with that? If your answer isn't ""build an operating system,"" then there's always a better language imho.";;

My suggestion would be to re-write (as much as possible) the code in Python 3. The only issues might be libraries written for Python 2, but it would be an excellent educational experience.;;
My suggestion is to just use python 2 to work with the book. The concepts won't be influenced much by the python2 to 3 switch. However, I recall that book's code was very refined. That is, much of it required some changes to actual work. A hard thing for a novice to handle.;;

"Rails ""won"" the mainstream job market. IDK why (came out earlier? was better at the time? someone else can answer that) but at one point it had a lot of hype and there were tons of jobs for it.

Even now after the hype ended it's still way more popular in job markets than Django (although I am seeing a lot more Django than before lately) because of the sheer amount of Rails apps made in the late 2000s/early 2010s—and there's still new companies that use it.

Anyway, [Two Scoops of Django](http://twoscoopspress.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8) is by far the most recommended book on the framework. IMO it's fairly overpriced ($40 for PDF) but it's still a solid choice.";;
"Great book recommendation! I'll be picking it up. 


I had a feeling Rails was going to get saturated at one point or another, like everything that makes money.

"In 2 years you decided to switch to VB?

I found VB was easier for me to pickup and understand than C# was, for some reason, though there are many similarities. I think I just found more easily accessible and easier to understand reference material for VB.;;
"Fair enough. Good answer. I would recommend taking a stab at C# if you get some time as I find it to be one of the most widely useful languages in both personal projects and enterprise level solutions. 

It has real time libraries for chat and games. It has great support for web dev through MVC 3/4/5 and beyond. It has access to WebAPI for building any sort of api. It also is used in Unity if you are interested in building games or anything cross platform that is graphical really. 

There are many other arguments for it and I suppose all the ones I just listed are also available in other languages I just feel it most broadly can be applied at the moment.";;
"lol my biggest achievement? using a switch case instead of a billion nested if/elses
";;
Much better indeed, but a switch statement isn't the best thing here either. If you look at each of the switch statements, the three cases are almost *identical*. Whenever you see almost the same code repeated many times, that's a sign that you could simplify things. The obvious way to do that here is to split the data (emulator name, path to emulator, etc.) from the code in the switch statements. The way to do that is to use a dictionary (Dictionary is a type in VB.NET), where you store the game system's name as the key (the thing you look up in the dictionary with), and the various data like emulator path, etc. as the values. Instead of using switch with almost the same code in each case, you can then look the data up *once* in the dictionary instead. ;;
"Thanks! I'm almost entirely self taught, so I figured there would be some gaps in my knowledge. I'll look into how to use dictionaries!

EDIT: So, what I would want to do is something like

 
    Dim emuDictionary As New Dictionary(Of String, String)
    	emuDictionary.Add(""nesEmu"", my.settings.nesEmuPath )
    	emuDictionary.Add(""nesROMS"", my.settings.nesROMPath)
            etc etc etc? 


Still trying to figure out how to move on further from there";;
"That's not quite what I meant, no. I mean that the dictionary should have one key named ""NES"", one named ""GameBoy"", etc. and those keys should give you *all* the data related to the given emulator. To accomplish this, you can make a [structure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/4ft0z102.aspx) to group emulator data together.  Something like

    Private Structure Emulator
        Public path As String
        Public wiki as String
        Public rom as String
    End Structure

(This is just an example of course)
A structure simply groups things together. Now you can write things like `Dim emu as Emulator` and then things like `emu.path = ...`, `emu.wiki = ...` and so on.

With such a structure you can make your dictionary like this:

    Dim emuDictionary As New Dictionary(Of String, Emulator)
    emuDictionary.Add(""NES"", New Emulator With { .path = whatever, .wiki = ""http://..."", .rom = something})
    emuDictionary.Add(""GameBoy"", New Emulator With { ...})

And so on. Also notice the conceptual ""cleanliness"" of grouping all the stuff that belongs to one emulator together :)

Now, instead of using a switch, you can simply do `emuDictionary(cbxPlatformSelect.SelectedItem)` to get the Emulator structure belonging to the selected platform. ";;

They use the [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).;;
"To provide some clarification on what arbostek said, they pull data using the reddit API, and then display it in whatever way they are set up to.

To use RIF (since I use it) as an example it pulls the titles, authors, ages, comment counts, subreddits, flairs etc of the first 20(?) posts, and displays that information in a series of boxes. Tapping one will open the link in a web viewer, unless it is a self post or link to something on reddit, in which case it brings up the relevant in app view. If you open the comments or a self post it will pull the comment info from the API and display it in a logical way. If you try to post a link or comment it posts it using the API.

Put simply, if it can be done via the site it can probably be done using the API, these apps just use the API to pull data, and then they display it however the developer set it up to be displayed.";;

One of the most important things to learn at the moment is responsive design

First you should find any beginner tutorial to understand how it's done and why it's done

After you get slightly comfortable with it, you can and probably should try to learn a framework like Bootstrap since it speeds up everything and offers a great set of tools 

I don't advise starting with Bootstrap instantly as sometimes you can be asked to make something by yourself without any use of libraries

You don't need to learn some deep javascript, the most obvious choice here is jQuery which is really easy to learn

You should know stuff like:

- selectors (class, id, children, parrent, siblings, next, prev, nth-child)
- interacting with elements (changing attributes, adding/removing classes, adding new elements to the page, changing texts)
- events (key press, click, page load)
- additionally - animations, changing css - hiding/showing elements

"Hey there! I'm actually the asker but Photoshop is one of my strong points. If you want to know more about the program itself there's awesome tutorials [here](https://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/tutorials.html) and [this](http://tv.adobe.com/watch/creative-suite-podcast-photographers/how-to-get-started-with-photoshop-cc-10-things-beginners-want-to-know-how/) covers some basics, though isn't exactly related to web design.

Generally I use photoshop as a way to create mock-ups of what the finished website will look like. It's a very rough draft, but it's mostly to get the colors correct and have a general idea of the layout the client wants.

From there, sometimes I look for similar layouts online, show them to the client, see if they're okay with it. If I'm lucky, find a blank source that's free to use that's similar to the feel I'm going for.

Then it's about transferring the PS design into code. Kind of like *you're* the WYSIWYG. Keep crafting it and resizing until it looks about like the draft. Usually through this process you'll come about a better layout than the original. For me the Photoshop mock-up is just a guideline, liable to change.

I did a quick search on a tutorial site, and found a few results. I haven't read them in full, so they might not be quite right, but maybe they'll help as a starting point?

"Sadly, I cannot point you anywhere as I knew Photoshop before I knew how to write HTML/CSS so I didn't had to learn it

You need to know photoshop tools (veeeery basic ones)

When I'm working on PSD files I just:

* export image layers into png/jpg (depending on the image type). Often you will need to rasterize them which is as simple as right clicking the layer and selecting your option

 merge some layers because some graphic designers tend to leave a lot of mess and you end up having one graphic file be made out of 4-5
* Whatever there is for measuring - padding/margin/width/height/whatever I just do it with... selection tool, I draw a rectangle and next to my cursor I see how big my selection is which then I apply to the CSS
* All colors are taken with color picker, obviously. Once you pick a color just left click it in your palette and you will even find HTML code for it

There is no big science behind this and looking at some youtube tutorials, everybody has their own method - different tools for cropping/measuring etc.";;
"Front-end is pretty much what I know, so it's nice to hear a response from someone who works in it :)

Sounds like responsive design will definitely be in my search history shortly. And I'll get to work on delving into the jQuery library. I know a lot of people who swear by it, so I'm off to read some source code.

Thankfully I'm actually a graphic designer, so Photoshop to HTML/CSS is what I've been doing since the start. I would map out sites for clients in PS back in the day. Glad to see that's still an accepted practice.";;
"I'm in the same spot. There's a lot of options. I just figure that as long as i'm learning something then I'm growing. I did the courses at codeacademy and it was a good introduction with practice into css, javascript, jquery, angularj, php. At least i know the basics now. I also got an oreilly book on PHP, mysql, javascript that I am working my way through. I use phpfiddle to practice php and i think codepen is good for front end practice. (I just use notepad on my desktop for front end stuff)

I think you should have general knowledge of the full spectrum before specializing. But I focus on one thing at a time sometimes so I don't get confused. Everything ties into everything else so as long as you are learning something and applying it then you can relax. Maybe let your interest or a specific project that you want to accomplish motivate you. 

Make a list of things you want to learn and brush up on and start working through it. Helps you see your progress and gives you a clear path. You don't have to become an expert in everything but you should become familiar with the basics of the syntax and what it is good for so you can come back to it if you ever need it. ";;
"Yeah I'm definitely thinking PHP is another I need to know, it seems front-end is using it increasingly more and more (from my time with Wordpress I found this to get very confusing, not realizing I was working with two languages, both HTML and PHP)

A bit of that and you may glide into a learning track that fits what you're trying to do.

"in your constructor, you create an RNG and then it goes out of scope, meaning its life is over. then in your randomGenerator() you create a new one (that you never seed). 

What you need is to move the rng into your class declaration, as a member variable. Then it will exist for the lifetime of the class. Might be a good time to brush up on lifetime vs scope of variables.";;
"So basically what I am doing is:


Create, seed, delete, create, call.



By adding inside the class, and not inside one of the classes' functions, I am creating it first, then when I make the object for the class, I am seeding it through the constructor. And then I am calling the RNG whose seed is saved because declaration created it and the object for the class is not out of scope yet.
So it goes: create, seed, call


I have added:

    the_generator.seed(t)        // t is the time point, this is the seed for it


And then I delete the std::mt19937_64 the_generator;  from my randomGenerator, thus I am not overlapping them, and I just call the one from the class within:

This is the C++11 equivalent of `srand(time(NULL));`. In other words, don't do this. If you want to have a source of entropy, use a [`std::random_device`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cppumeric/random/random_device).

You also don't want to create and destroy your distribution object ever time you call `Map_Generation::randomGenerator`. These objects can contain *a lot* of state that is expensive to create/destroy. Making it a class member will fix this.

">I am getting errors

That is odd. `decltype` is part of C++11. Which compiler (and version) are you using?

>I do not exactly understand what is within param()

The [`param()`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cppumeric/random/uniform_int_distribution/param) member function is a way of resetting the interval over which the random numbers are produced. Normally, this is done by passing the values into the constructor like so

    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(lower_limit, upper_limit);

However, when the distribution object is a member of your class, you don't want to keep calling the constructor over and over because it can be expensive to tear down and rebuild these objects. By using `param()`, you can build the object once and then change the distribution limits dynamically.

    decltype(dist)::param_type(lower_limit, upper_limit)

`decltype(x)` says ""give me the **decl**ared **type** of `x`"". Here, `x` is `dist` and `decltype(dist)` is `std::uniform_int_distribution<int>`. This class has a type member called `param_type` that takes two arguments: the upper and lower limits for the output range of numbers.";;
"I am using Visual Studio 2013, which according to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx does indeed have an implementation of decltype (v1.1).


Alright so param() 
is specific to distribution methods, similar to how >seed() is to engines?


But if it is as simple a definition as ""changes the interval over which numbers are generated"", why isn't it something like:


    dist.param(lower_limit, upper limit);


As for decltype(), as far as I understand it, it returns the type of data that has been declared for whatever variable. So if I say 


   int x;
   std::cout<<sizeof(decltype(x));


Would this return the size of int, or is decltype() only valid for certain things, such as distribution. Also since I am assuming param() is similar to seed(), would this also be valid?:


    std::mt19937 x;
    x.seed(decltype(x)::seed(5));


For as redundant as it may seem?


Thank you for the help, by the way. For me it is like going from swimming in the bath tub to swimming in the ocean in a way so I might be a bit hard to understand of some concepts.";;
">I am using Visual Studio 2013, which according to https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx[1] does indeed have an implementation of decltype (v1.1).

I don't use VC++, so I am afraid I likely will be of little help. You might try upgrading to VS2015 or try using `__declspec`.

>Alright so param() is specific to distribution methods, similar to how >seed() is to engines?

Yup. The `param` mechanism is a little more open-ended than `seed` so as to allow for implementation-dependent functionality or future extensions to the distribution function parameters.

>But if it is as simple a definition as ""changes the interval over which numbers are generated"", why isn't it something like:

    dist.param(lower_limit, upper limit);

That's a great question! Officially, the signature is `param(const param_type &)`. Although `param_type` is not specified by the standard, it is likely to be a [`std::seed_seq`](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cppumeric/random/seed_seq/seed_seq) (it is on gcc, anyway). There are three constructors for this class: default, iterator range, and `std::initializer_list` (and on gcc they are `explicit`). This means that you can't pass a list (or even a braced init list) to `param` without going through the `param_type` constructor.

>As for decltype(), as far as I understand it, it returns the type of data that has been declared for whatever variable. So if I say

    int x; std::cout<<sizeof(decltype(x));

>Would this return the size of int

Yup.

>or is decltype() only valid for certain things, such as distribution.

Nope. You can use it on any variable, including those declared using `auto`.

>Also since I am assuming param() is similar to seed(), would this also be valid?:

    std::mt19937 x;
    x.seed(decltype(x)::seed(5));

That isn't valid because `seed` is a non-static method of the `std::mt19937` class, not a static method or member type. A more common example is accessing the element type of an STL container `c` using `decltype(c)::value_type`.

>Thank you for the help, by the way.

You are quite welcome. I'm glad I could be of some help.

>For me it is like going from swimming in the bath tub to swimming in the ocean in a way so I might be a bit hard to understand of some concepts.

Haha. It's ok. We have all been there before. These are new features and facilities in the language, so everyone is having to learn them.";;
"After a bit of googling, it seems the problem was that, by using decltype that way inside of .param was basically calling a function by also typing the type of data in the parameters. For example:


    void function(int one, int two); //Declare and define
    function(int arguement1, int arguement2); //Calling, this is basically what decltype was doing, and it is why it was telling me type name not allowed


The solution then becomes:


    std::uniform_int_distribution<int>::param_type parameters(lower_limit, upper_limit);  //Which basically creates a set of parameters, to be used in whichever distribution I want
    dist.param(parameters);  //Then I apply it to the distribution itself


Which works, but to me personally it seems more akin to:


    int x;       //The creation of the distribution
    int y=5;   //Creation of the parameters
    x=y;        //Equivalent of dist.param()


Instead of a much quicker:


    int x;
    x=5;


What other method of doing this that I think could possibly also be viable is creating a new distribution for each new sequence of numbers and then somehow pass it around the class and then make it go out of scope at the end of the sequence.


Talking of which, is it possible to make an object associated to a class go out of scope before the actual end of the program? Thus triggering the deconstructor. ";;
"> For example:
> void function(int one, int two); //Declare and define

Where did you find that explanation? I would be interested to see exactly what code they were trying to explain, because that is not at all what `decltype` does. According to [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd537655.aspx), `decltype` is implemented and exhibits standards-conforming behavior as of Visual Studio 2010.

>The solution then becomes:
    
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int>::param_type parameters(lower_limit, upper_limit);
    dist.param(parameters);

This is precisely what `dist.param(decltype(dist)::param_type(lower_limit,upper_limit));` does, except it doesn't create the `parameters` variable that has a lifetime outside of the `param` invocation. This will work as a stop-gap until we can figure out what is going on with VC++ and `decltype`.

>Which works, but to me personally it seems more akin to:

    int x;       //The creation of the distribution

>Instead of a much quicker:

Not quite. It's more like

    int x=5, y=4;
    foo(x,y);

instead of just

    foo(5,4);

>What other method of doing this that I think could possibly also be viable is creating a new distribution for each new sequence of numbers and then somehow pass it around the class and then make it go out of scope at the end of the sequence.

I'm not sure I follow. Class data members already exhibit this behavior.

>Talking of which, is it possible to make an object associated to a class go out of scope before the actual end of the program? Thus triggering the deconstructor.

It is a dangerous idea to destroy a class data member before the containing class object is itself destroyed. The guiding principle of C++ classes is that the construct establishes an *invariant*^1 for the class that is upheld by all member functions for the lifetime of the class instance. If you break the invariant, you get undefined behavior.

[1] A set of rules establishing which data members are initialized when the class instance begins its life. You can think of it as a constructor promising that the data members will be put into a usable state for all of the non-static member functions.";;
">Where did you find that explanation?


That was more my personal opinion, based on the fact that the type of error I am receiving on is `type name is not allowed` which from what I know is found often in cases such as my example. So I may absolutely be wrong in what I said as to how it behaves.


>I'm not sure I follow. Class data members already exhibit this behavior.


What I was referring to was:


    class Distribution{
    public:
    void assign(int lower_limit, int upper_limit);
    int generate();
    private:
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist;
    std::mt19937_64 the_generator;
    std::random_device ran_dev;
    }
    void Distribution::assign(int lower_limit, int upper_limit){
    std::uniform_int_distribution<int> dist(lower_limit, upper_limit); //So basically recreating it, I'm not sure how it behaves here
    }
    int Distribution::generate(){
    return dist(the_generator);
    }


Assuming that all other required functions exist. How would creating a distribution with the same name within the same class? Will it simply error out, overwrite, overload? My idea was if for example I wanted to generate a sequence of 1000 numbers, by creating(or rather recreating) a distribution with the parameters I need, I won't need to reassign the limits every time I call the function. Actually thinking of that, wouldn't it be a smart idea to simply do what I just said but rather than recreating the distribution, I just create a new parameter for the already existing distribution? But if I do create new parameters, will they actually save within the scope of the class, as opposed to the scope of the function?";;

"Python would be a good choice here. It is easy for beginners to pick up and there are tons of packages available to make exactly what you want to do loads easier. Packages are just code other people have written that you can implement in your program (lesson 1 of programming: Be lazy!). For instance,
there is a package called matplotlib which can plot graphs from data exactly as you described. 

In terms of timescales, it really depends on the person. Some people just click with the logic behind programming languages, though I'm sure as a science dude you'll be fine. Pick a tutorial and work through it. There are tons out there, all with different styles. Learn Python The Hard Way by Zed Shaw was how I learned but many people dislike his style. Think Python is a good alternative to that as its tone is more informal. Online courses like Udacity can be good but they dictate the pace of learning (which may or may not be a bad thing for you). In short, pick a style that feels good for you and don't get disheartened if one route isn't working. 

Regarding timescales, you could get technically have all that done almost as soon as you know how to read data and write an if statement. You could work through a Python tutorial in a week or two and have enough information to get started. It can be daunting to start something though and it may take a few more weeks of practice to build up your confidence. Learning what packages to use for outputting the data might take a little while longer but I think two months is definitely feasible. Practice is key though!

"I will also chime in (agree with everything said above), and mention that it is INCREDIBLY important to learn now how to break up your 'program' into components that you can work on separately. This is good as the program grows in size it stays maintainable, but the main reason for beginners it is key is it gives a nice positive feedback loop of actually being able to finish something tangible.

Eg before you get to the interpreation etc etc, start by saying I'm going to take a csv file that has the eeg data and I'm going to read it in and plot it (eg using matplotlib). 

Then step two would be, I'm going to refactor (rewrite using your better understanding a longer term solution) that script to a function so I can read the data in, then pass it to a 'plot_eeg' function.

Then step 3 may be, ok, now I want to be able to read in 2 eegs, and make a plot to overlay to compare them. repeat step 2 (refactor after every step)

... step 4, use pandas to come up with key statistics I can use to compare (peak height, time between peaks, whatever)

....


...

Then you can eventually get to, I will turn it into app/webapp that a user can upload a csv file, it will compare metrics and make a prediction etc.

There's nothing here that's hard enough to make using other peoples code a huge time saver, assuming you pass the brain waves in by parameter (frequency, amplitude etc) rather than as a bunch data points that you then need to interpret.

Since you're just learning a new language, I don't think you should try to write a book with it quite yet. Toy around with the syntax. 

My recommendation is this:

Codecademy --> Treehouse --> Your own project

Use Codecademy for all of their intros to languages. You should be able to finish all of them in a couple weeks. Or if you just want to do one language, you could do Python in 2-3 days at a reasonable pace.

Then, go to Treehouse to understand how to use your algorithmic skills to put together larger projects. You can finish most of the projects in a few days, and there's a wide variety of them.

Once you've done that, you're free! You could be at this stage in just a couple weeks. Continue to read documentation and open source projects. Begin your own projects, join others, and maybe also seek employment (after further seasoning).

Level 2: Create a class to store each wave in. Make the similarity function a method. Store the score of and a link to the most similar wave in your class.

Level 3: Set up an SQLlite server to store your data, create increasing complex similarity functions, take a look at the sci-kit learn module [this should be the first time you look at a non-standard module, except for maybe matplotlib]

- Implement your data/command input and output with a class that uses the terminal

I don't really have much experience with ML, but [here](https://daoudclarke.github.io/machine%20learning%20in%20practice/2013/10/08/machine-learning-libraries/) is a list of available machine learning toolkits. A good concept to begin researching is SVM, or Support Vector Machines.

As far a time goes, it's hard to say. It depends on how good at researching you are, how well you understand the concepts, and what bugs inevitably pop up.

Edit: This is machine learning if the user inputs the actual waveform, not just the parameters of it. If the user just types in a few numbers and the program does some calculations, your life will be a heck of a lot easier.";;
Taking notes is a great way to learn, in my opinion. If you write notes to remind you of the certain things you should and shouldn't do then you might find yourself saving time in the long run.;;
I don't think it can. People learn in different ways, and I know writing/typing things I learned helped reinforce the concept into my mind. Personally, whenever I'm learning something, I like to type out the example code given with long comments noting everything related to it. Some people learn better from writing, some from listening, just do what works for you. ;;
"Personally, before I ever start typing any code, I box everything out on paper to get a feel for how the program/component will be structured.  Then I start writing out descriptions of what every piece should do, to the point where I'll sometimes have 40-50 pages of scratch work before even touching a keyboard.  This can take awhile, but, in my experience, it generally saves time in the long run, both in the initial construction and in maintenance.  This method also has the added bonus that the first draft of your documentation is incorporated into the design phase.

You could probably get by without writing anything down, but think of it this way.  You could build a house on the fly, with only a rough idea of where everything will be and how it will be connected.  But, in practice, you hire an architect to provide you with a blueprint and then build from that, making minor changes as necessary or desired.";;
I agree to a point. Some basic planning and blueprinting is a good idea, although if I plan out the entire feature, some aspect of the implementation ends up changing the design midway. ;;
"I think you'll be fine. Everyone learns their own way, and honestly sometimes I have to step back from the computer, and just *draw* out a plan. You can get so stuck in the virtual world when the answer's really simple when you doodle it out or apply it to the real world.

Only thing I'd say: keep it organized. If you get a good idea, you want to be able to find it and not have to scrounge through a bag hoping a crushed piece of paper will be there. I tend to keep a 3-ring binder with me. If I write something on a stickie note, or just an errant piece of paper, I can hole punch it and add it to my binder.";;
I always use the pen & paper approach on problem solving / debugging, learning new things etc. You should use what makes you confident. Hell, I even wrote on paper a 6 pages app because I couldn't understand something from that app. And yes it worked.;;
It's probably a good habit, and if anything, it may make you faster.  If you keep organized notes, anyway, you may have a head start whenever you're context-switching.;;
Don't be silly, keep on scribbling. Don't worry about slowing down. Worry about getting blocked, and being able to proceed. One way I learnt was by taking notes, then re-reading my notes to take notes of the notes. Eventually distilling them down to an index card.  When trying to solve hard programming problems I've alway found it useful to write diagrams. Scribbling is good.;;
Actually, you do what's best for YOU. Don't get baffled if a person X can keep variables and critical algorithmic constraints in his mind. The point of programming is not how quickly you can code. Of course it is a plus point to have but the main motto of programming is to program correctly the first time. To program with almost zero bugs. That's a rare skill to have. And planning out before coding is something everyone should do. It saves a whole lot of time whilst you're coding and you can just focus on syntax rather than thinking what algorithmic bugs to avoid.;;
I do this all the time. I'm fact, I keep a clipboard and my chosen fountain pen of the day right next to the keyboard. I jot down the next steps I want to accomplish, ideas, UI/UX layouts, flow charts, pretty much whatever I need to keep out of my mind so I can focus on coding.;;
"Do whatever helps you improve as a programmer. When I'm designing an algorithm, I always use pen and paper. I can quickly throw down some pseudo code before the method I have in my head flutters away. I can quickly scratch things out, use arrows to track the data flow, and draw diagrams of how different data structures should be acting with arbitrary values. 

I recently received a Bachelor's in CS, and in all the classes about logic, algorithms, time-complexity analysis, etc all of the assignments and exams were exclusively hand-written in pseudo code. Obviously this was not the case in the classes that specifically taught languages, but otherwise pen and paper was the most efficient method.

For reference:

    //Java code
    public static void main(String args[]){
    List<String> stringList = new List<>();
    for(int i = 0; i < stringList.size(); i++){   
        stringList.add(""+i);
     }
    }       

Pseudo'd:

    main{
    List<> -> sL
    for(sL)
        sL.add(i)  
    }   ";;
"I always have notepad.exe and an actual notepad in front 
Pseudo code on the machine

"+1 for pseudo code damn near everything. A lot of times ill do it in Sublime and move around calls and such until I think the flow works properly. Then I comment out the ""directions"" and write actual code under each direction, that way all my pseudo code becomes built in comments. ";;
that's an even better idea, pseudo becomes the start of the comments!;;
Goodness no, it often helps. I keep a pen and binder book on my desk at all times at work. Recently I had to use it to figure out how to rewrite a whole chunk of some open source UI component I was using to insert a bunch of extra elements into it. I would have stuffed around for ages trying to get all of the programmatically drawn components lined up right had I not drawn up a rough schematic beforehand. ;;
Three months ago I started my internship and I had never before that taken any notes what so ever. Two weeks in and I just had to start taking notes and draw things out. ;;
"The fact that you take time to think about the problem and write it down will probably actually make you a better and more efficient programmer. I'd take the guy who writes shit down and finishes in 3 hours over the guy who tries to recompile troubleshoot and ends up with an unfinished program in 8 hours.

Now I think it's a problem if you're writing down EVERYthing that you're going to be coding. But pseudocode or diagrams are absolutely great to be doing before you code.";;
"Depends. Ultimately its up to you to decide if it benefits you. I read a book on PHP, MySQL, html, css and javascript five years ago and never really used it so i forgot it all. But I did get an idea of how everything fits together. I took lots of notes but never read them again. Whenever i needed to do some web stuff I would just google the problem or the syntax and get what I needed there. i only really learned the stuff that I used a lot which was C# and java regardless of whether or not I took notes when learning. 

I am currently reading the web book again, a modern version, and i am making cheat sheets out of the information. I want to be able to go through the notes to get an overview of each language so I don't have to read through the chapters which takes a long time. After I'm done I want to memorize the differences between javascript and php because I keep getting them mixed up and i can't do it unless the information is summarized and easy for me to skim over. I think this time the notes will be more useful but if I don't end up using it much then it probably won't stick.";;

"Usually your DB library will throw the appropriate exception if something you asked it to do is invalid. Your role is to catch any exception *your application has the logic to handle* and do something suitable.

Here's the key thing - if you don't know what to do when you catch an exception, don't catch it. Your hope is that someone higher up the call stack will have the right logic to do something with it.";;
"To add to this, there are two basic rules to follow:

* The principle of least surprise
* Fail fast and close to the source of the error

Exceptions are surprising! Did you know that control can leave any function, at any point, at any time? With exceptions it can! So if you are using exceptions as control flow, [stop](http://arne-mertz.de/2015/01/dont-try-too-hard/). Exceptions are objects. They are a way for parts of your program to communicate: ""Hey, I followed the instructions you wrote, but the input or environment wasn't compatible. Maybe the function that invoked me knows what to do"".

This is why the fail fast principle is important. Don't ""recover"" from an exception by just catching it and carrying on. Your program was supposed to do something. A function *[half](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh279653.aspx)* ran. Maybe it modified  half a file before failing - now the next time you read that file it will be garbage and you will get some other cryptic error in a completely different method! If you catch an exception with no way of actually doing anything about it, what have you achieved?";;
Shouldn't I catch all the exceptions to at least show an error message in the presentation layer?;;
"When an exception occurs, there are probably a few ways to recover from it:

* Fall back to an alternate method
* Retry (with some max and a backoff?)
* Roll back any changes so far (then rethrow)
* Attempt to fix the issue (e.g. create the missing file) then retry
* Inform the user and get them to fix it
* CRASH! This is not a bad thing - often better to abort the program than continue running in an indeterminate state which might have serious side effects.

That's far from a comprehensive list, but the point is that you don't always need to get the user involved.

That's why it's important to rethrow or not catch if there's nothing you can do to fix the problem.

"i think it's best to keep in mind that programming is problem solving--when you build an application you are solving a problem.

that being said, it's also worth considering the how complex a problem you choose really is. when youre just starting out you dont necessarily have the tools that will make these complex problems easy to solve.

it sounds like youre enthusiastic, but you cant reach the validation that makes working hard worthwhile.

i would say start by thinking of an application you would like to make. before you start typing any code, really try to plan it out. it's key to remember that a good solution is not made on the fly, just as a good program isnt just made because you sit down and code something with what you know. really plan. this will help you keep perspective when finally implementing your solution (the code).

in general, keep it simple--give yourself reasonable goals.";;

But.... it is. For me it started off as the most natural thing in the world, and I was making a Tetris clone after a couple of weeks. Other people continually struggle with the most basic concepts until they burn out. Also depends on what you want to learn how to do.;;
"Sorry, but it legitimately does vary. I teach a class on programming, and have found that some people take to it like a duck to water + are able to learn very effectively without even trying, whereas other students will struggle for the entire quarter despite trying and studying ridiculously hard + getting hours-long tutoring sessions from me...

If you have prior experience problem-solving and have a STEM or logic-based background (math, etc), if you're self-driven, and if you're detail-oriented, you'll probably have an easier time, but it's genuinely impossible to judge. Some people just ""get"" it, others don't, and most people are in between. 

Plus, to complicate the issue, programming is not something you really ever stop learning. Programming and computer science isn't the sort of thing where you get a degree/take a course, find a job, and stop learning right there and then. There isn't a magical line where one moment you're a beginner and the next you're competent. Programming is the sort of career where you never stop learning. 

(And if you do stop learning, you've either hit a dead end and should find another job, or have plateaued/burned out and should consider switching careers. People who do not love learning don't tend to fare well as programmers).

I've been coding for 6 years, and I would still count myself a beginner relative to all the programmers out there in the world and all the things there are to learn. There are people who can get a job after a year of studying (and it's not an impossible feat), but I would argue those people are still very much beginners.

They're not necessarily getting hired due to their skill level or because they're experts -- they're getting hired partly because companies are desperate for talent, and because they've shown a lot of potential + have ramped up quickly + have learned as much as could reasonably be expected after a year or so.

So, to answer your question literally, it would take your entire life, perhaps even more to learn a good subset of everything related to programming and computer science. If your question is how long it'd take to become genuinely good at programming, probably a decade. And if your question is how long it'd take before you'd be able to call yourself reasonably competent + find a job, I'd say an optimistic estimate is about a year or so (though this will vary wildly from person to person).";;

"Some anecdotal evidence:
* Intensive bootcamps (70 hours a week) take 3 months to learn a basic stack
* Self-learners who have studied full time intensively have reported on here getting a job within 6-9 months. 

So, if you are self-learning, I would say:
* 6 months minimum if you are going full speed, full time
* Double that or more if you're doing this evenings and weekends.

If you're doing the latter, you might not even get there, if you're not doing enough hours to (a) keep progressing in your learning, while also (b) putting in to practice what you've already covered. There is a strong chance of regression if the hours simply don't add up.

That said, it really does depend on what you want to do, front-end, back-end, full stack, mobile only etc.";;
So getting a job within 6-9 months after learning? This is something I would everyday/every chance I get to learn - not just weekends and evenings. And what's a stack? xD;;
"Do a search of this sub. It's all here.

"Stick with it, if you like it, it's for you, if not it's not. You're young, try lots of different languages and courses. See what you like.

A good way to get or stay engaged is to make your own program or app--it will force you to learn a lot of things you didn't know, and the fact that it's yours will keep you into it.

Edit: Hold on, something smells fishy here.  If the script is `/a/b/c/d/cscript.sh`, and the file is `/a/b/f/filename.file`, and you ran `./cscript.sh filename.file`, that would not work.  You would have had to have ran `./cscript.sh /a/b/f/filename.file`, in which case you already have the full path to the file.  Or if the CWD is `/a/b/f`, then you could run `/a/b/c/d/cscript.sh filename.file`, but in that case you don't need the full path to the file because it's in the CWD.  In neither case do you need to use `readlink` or anything like it.  I think you need to describe what you're actually trying to do here.

The trick with programming you have to play the long game, eg if self learning, really work on developing best practices as you aren't under the gun - learn (alongside the programming itself) to use version control, DRY (don't-repeat-yourself) principles, refactor your code continually, and you will actually *learn*.

If you want to be involved with the actual, coding, development process, you have to go with the good ol' Computer Science degree. It will focus on teaching you the fundamentals of programming with the most widely used languages at first, and then branch out into what differentiates the developers from code monkeys which is the logic, algorithms, and time-complexity analysis (read: math, math, and math). Take the electives which interest you most and are inline with your goals (Mobile development, graphics, etc).;;
Not necessarily. My brother went to DePaul for game developement and he now works for a company out of San Diego working on a playstation exclusive.;;
Ah yeah if you go exclusively for a game development education, they will give you the tools needed to work on games.

This indicates that although in earlier trials the program gave the correct alphabetized output, that the program breaks somehow when I give it this input.  What's going on here?  I feel that I can learn a lot from this program.  Please explain like I'm 5.  I am self taught and this is my first attempt at a recursive method.  My instinct tells me that it's capitals that are screwing with the program.

Eddit:  after significantly more testing, I suspect what it's doing is putting the first item from still unsorted in the beginning and then evaluating based on length after that.";;
"OK so line 18 is a weak check that the array is sorted. it should be <= instead of <, what if a user gives two apples? Also, it should actually check more than the first position of the unsorted array. 

More importantly, line 17. i=0 needs to be initialized outside of the function, or passed in the function parameters. Each instance of the function is pushed to the stack, evaluated, and the value is returned, but how does the stackframe know that i is a thing to be returned? It is set to 0 on every call. On line 18, you have guaranteed that it will only check the unsorted[0] against sorted[0] and if that is true, then the sort is called again, but because i is reinitialized, then the same check occurs into infinity, the program develops a memory leak and eventually crashes. 
";;
"Thank you for the response.   Don't I want it to reset to 0 each iteration so that it starts at 0 and then increments until unsorted[0] ! < sorted [i] so that unsorted[0] can be inserted after the word that it is greater than?

If you want me to rephrase that question please tell me. ";;

OK, so a memory leak is when the computer allocates memory for a task, and never deallocates it. This is a bubble sort. Look up mergesort and quicksort. The other algorithms are better implemented as non recursive. Although recursion can solve all problems it is slow and wasteful. Translate the other sorts into ruby from another language, without looking at a ruby implementation.";;
"To start, you have semicolons after both of your for loops. This forces the first for loop to complete before the second one begins instead of nesting the loops.

If you ever see a tutorial with `void main()`, ditch it immediately.  The same goes for `while ( !file.eof() )`.  These are sure signs they don't know what they're taking about.;;
"Alright, and what would be the correct way to write while(!file.eof()) because I've seen that on a few threads also

"Assuming file is a stream I usually do:

     while(file >> str)

To be clear there is a time and place for eof(), but you have to understand the nuiance of what's happening:

when you do file >> str an attempt to write  the next stuff in the filestream into str is made. If this fails (because of the end of file or some other error like conversion errors) then nothing is read, an error flag is raised and the expression returns false. 

Now what file.eof() does is check whether or not the eof flag has been raised, it will not check for other types of errors (file.fail() would check for any type of error) that may have stopped the stream and it will only be true **after** a read has been attempted. This means that a loop using while ( !file.eof() ) will actually read one extra time. ";;
"    xpos > 20

The problem is, the loop only executes when this condition is true. Look through your code and try to see why the for loop is never going to execute.";;
I do that every time, that's one problem down, thank you;;
"First of all, main() should return int instead of void. I'm not sure how you were able to compile this at all to be honest. Even if you don't explicitly have a return statement for main(), it *never* returns void. 

Second, xpos and ypos should be of type int, not of type char. 

Third, you're loop has xpos > 20 and ypos > 20, when they should be checking if they're *less* than 20. 

Fourth, remove the char floor[20][20]. It's never used.

Fifth, you're conditions are set up wrong (look up operator precedence in C++).

EDIT: To reflect the changes you made in your code, some advice about the conditions. Try to think about what each condition does. To give you some help, change the first if statements condition to (ypos == 0 && xpos != 0 && xpos != 19) || (ypos == 19 && xpos != 0 && xpos != 19). Think about what that condition means, and than try changing the other ones by thinking about the meaning.";;

"You're not returning anything in the else block

    return isEven(number);";;
Oh, thank you.  Problem solved.;;
"Just a minor thing, you could shorten your `else` block. Instead of this:

    else {
      number = number - 2;
      return isEven(number);
    }

You can instead do 

    else {
      return isEven(number - 2);
    }

The main idea behind recursion is that you keep simplifying something. It would make more sense to return a simplified version of the number which is (`number - 2`) instead of just `number`.";;
You could also make it into a switch. ;;
What? ;;
"Apparently my opinion isn't shared, but when I see a chain of `if` statements of the form `value == [literal]`, I change it to a switch statement, given that that is what they're made for:

            return true;

            return false;

It also uses strict comparison (`===`) which is good practice in JS (though no reason you couldn't explicitly do it in the if/else if/else form).";;

Well you *could* do it with bit shifts by comparing the number to the same number after a right and left shift. The right most bit falls off, so if it was a 1, the two comparisons will be different, and thus, it was odd. ;;

"Take the following code:

    function IntWrapper() {
        this.num = 0;
    }

    IntWrapper.prototype.add = function(x) {
        this.num += x;
    }

    // ...

    function test(func) {
        func(6);
    }

    // ...

    var foo = new IntWrapper();
    test(foo.add);
    console.log(foo.num);

What do you suppose the last 3 lines will do?

Naively, what you might expect is that:

1. We create a new instance of the `IntWrapper` class
2. We pass in the foo.add method to `test`
3. The `test` function will call `foo.add`
3. `foo.num` is now equal to 6.

Sadly, JavaScript being JavaScript, this is not what happens. Rather, what happens is this:

1. We create a new instance of the `IntWrapper` class
2. We pass in the IntWrapper.add method to `test`
3. The `test` function will call that method.
4. Inside the `IntWrapper.add` method, JavaScript will first start by trying to look up `this.num`.
5. You might think that `this` will refer to `foo`, but nope -- what `this` refers to will _vary_ depending on who the caller is. Since we called the `IntWrapper.add` method inside of a _function_ (the caller is `test`), the `this` keyword will refer to either the global context (`window`) or undefined, depending on if you're in strict mode or something or other (I refuse to memorize exactly what happens on principle because it's stupid and a waste of brain cells).
6. So ultimately, we're going to look up either `window.num` or `undefined.num`, which is the wrong thing no matter how you look at it, and our code fails.

What the `bind` method will do is set up the method so that the `this` keyword will refer to the correct thing/be ""frozen"" regardless of who the caller is. So, if we modified the penultimate line to:

    test(foo.add.bind(foo));

...then we're telling JavaScript that whenever `foo.add` is called, we want `this` to always refer to `foo`. Then our code works. This also means that if we were to do this:

    var foo = new IntWrapper();
    var bar = new IntWrapper();
    test(foo.add.bind(bar));

...then when we call `this`, `bar.num` will be changed but `foo.num` will not be modified.

So, basically, to summarize, the `this` keyword in JavaScript will change what it refers to depending on who _calls_ that function, not where the function was defined (fickle little bastard). This is in odds to pretty much every single other programming language, where the `this` keyword (or equivalent) uses lexical scoping (is set in stone when the function is original defined). The `bind` function is one of the workarounds we have to make JavaScript do the sensible thing.";;
"The `then` method takes a function as a parameter and this code wants to pass a function that adds the data to the `results` array. `results.push` is basically what the code wants to use but the way JavaScript sets the `this` reference makes using `results.push` insufficient.

The value of `this` depends on how a function is called and not on how the function was named. `results.push` is the name of the function that can push data into objects that have the same prototype chain as the `results` object. The function is independent of `results`. If you store this function in a variable and then call it later the value of `this` inside the function will not be `results`.

To force the value to be `results` you must use `bind`, as you have read.";;
"`results.push` is `Array.prototype.push`, which is a function that appends an element to the object it was invoked on (i.e. `this`).  That works fine if you're calling it as `results.push(42)` since `this` will be `results` in that case.

But what if you can't call it as `results.push`?  Remember, the value of `this` depends on the call site.  Consider:

    var foo = results.push;
    foo(42);

Everything about this is exactly the same as `results.push(42);`, i.e. it's calling the same function and passing the same arguments, except that `this` will no longer be `results`, it will be the global object.  That's useless, since it means the function will try to append 42 to the global object rather than to `results`.  The only way it knows to act on `results` is if it is called as `results.push()`.  That information is lost otherwise.

And the above is exactly what would happen if you try to write `myRequest(...).then(results.push);`  That's going to pass `results.push` as a parameter, which is conceptually the same thing as assigning it to the variable `foo` in the example above.  The call site when the callback is eventually called will may like `foo()` above, setting `this` to the global object, or it may set `this` to some value related to the promise.  You'd have to look up the documentation to find out, but the point is that whatever it is, `this` will *not* be `results`, which is what it needs to be.

Using `bind` is a way to bind a function to a certain value of `this`.  `results.push.bind(results)` returns a new function that when called, calls the `push` function with `this` bound to `results`.  This makes it equivalent to having written `results.push(...)`.

Personally, I find it more readable to forget all this and just write a callback that does what you want explicitly:

    myRequest(...).then(function(item) { results.push(item); })

Simple and clear.  (Note: I'm assuming here that there's only one item to be appended, and that this is not going to pass multiple arguments to the callback.  If that's the case, then `bind` doesn't look quite as bad.)

";;
"Thanks, these answers really helped me understand the use of the bind function.

My second point of confusion is how does results.push.bind(results) know what to push into the array? The explicit callback you wrote above is clear in that results.push(item) pushes ""item"" into the array, but how does it work for the promise?";;
"> how does results.push.bind(results) know what to push into the array?

When the action completes successfully and the promise is fulfilled, it calls the success callback, passing the data from the request as an argument.  The bound version of `push` acts exactly like the normal version of `push` except for the setting of `this`, so it receives that argument the same as if it was called as `results.push(data)`.

In other words, in the case of `bind` the arguments are passed through implicitly, whereas in the example I gave, there's a function that takes an argument `item` and passes it on by calling `results.push(item)` explicitly.  As I alluded to at the end, in the case of `bind` this happens no matter the number of arguments, whereas in my example I'm only passing one through, so if it was the case that this particular promise implementation passed multiple arguments for some reason, only the first one would go through in my example whereas all of them would go through in the case of `bind`.  That's probably not relevant, since most callbacks only care about the first arg, but maybe there's some circumstance where it would matter.";;

"I do not work in Ruby but the error suggest that there is no way out of your recursion.  You are basically running out of room to put things on the stack is what it sounds like.

">     stack level too deep (SystemStackError)

I'm not too familiar with Ruby, but I'm pretty sure that this is a [stack overflow error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_overflow). 

Your method is recursing too deeply. A common cause is simply a programming error that results in infinite recursion. If it only happens with larger inputs (like a very large list), then it might be that the input is too large for a recursive solution, so you might want to increase the stack size if you can, or use a non-recursive solution instead. 

Like I said, I'm not too familiar with Ruby, but my guess would be that you're not removing items from the `user_list` near line 22 of your posted code. As a result, `user_list` stays the same size, and your base case (`user_list.length <= 0`) is never reached.

There were 3 ranks (1,2,3, simple enough) and when the data would update, I had the cell color change as well, mainly for aesthetic purposes.

I've mostly done back end stuff too, but also some JSF web apps way back plus some Swing more recently.

"My advice:
--
____

 * **Manage your frustration.** Whenever you see something in code that makes you go.... ""Wait what is that thing?"" Take deep breath, the answer is not very hard, you just gotta find it. 

 * **Learn to let go of your preconceptions.** A big problem in learning new things is when people think they have an idea of what it is already. If you havent learned something you dont know what it is, and any assumptions you have made are just random guessess.     
On the flipside of this you will find lots of programmers who no longer remember what it was even like to not understand something that to them is just simple logic. This will happen to you too. Programming is such that that its all perfectly logical once you understand it, that it seems incredulous to have ever viewed something differently. 

 * **Do stuff. Then do them again.**   

This is my best advice. You say you want to learn to make a game. Well this is a tremendous amount of work, with lots of different pieces. You will first learn how to set up a game loop. Then how to use a graphical framework. Then you will have to make player classes, and npc classes. Then a world system. Then collision. Then the game logic. Then the GUI. Then any features you want to add. 

Each of these tasks will take you weeks to do, but once you can do them all. Start over and do it all in one day. And then a week later do it again. 

The best training I had was a a teacher that made me do this, after months of going through it all in detail he said one day, ok now start over and you have till lunchtime to be done, go.  

That's how you get better, by absorbing the complexities and putting them behind you, then move on to new complexities. ";;

After another four years, dozens of research papers, and a 400 page dissertation, I finally had a Ph D.

"So, a lot of times beginners will underestimate how much effort their ""first project"" will take - I think now is one of those times.

I don't want to discourage you from making this game if it is your end goal, but you should start with something that is a little more.... fundamental.

For example, what about a project that syncs your desktop folders/files with a backup hard drive? Or if you don't have a backup drive, just a ""project test"" folder on your C drive? Even that could be a little advanced for someone really green, but I think it would be a little bit more palatable and ultimately educational.

I'm a beginner, but IMO starting with OS level programmes makes sense (and python is good for this). Things like moving files about, creating directories and such can bear good problems and have productive results. Also it's a more familiar playground, you've probably used your OS a fair bit already and therefore seeing output from a directory structure you can check with the finder / window manager / file browser (whatever) is a good way to ground one's self on what's actually going on with the programme. 

Also it will make you more familiar with working with your OS in this manner. This is also why learning initially from CLI and basic text editor makes sense to me, initially one probably doesn't need an in depth debugger or high powered IDE as the programmes will be single file and generally pretty simple. (I've nothing against IDEs in the long run or whatever). Tools like Git are often used from CLI as well (obviously there are loads of uses)

"I started programming a few years ago. Everything was very confusing but it slowly came together. I found that working on projects was crucial to understanding what the significance was of what I had learned. I am now in a routine where I fluctuate between learning and doing. I will spend a few days or weeks reading and then try to apply it. Learning takes a long time because there is so much.

If you enjoy doing it then keep it up. I do many things while in a cloud of confusion. I just push through and struggle for the info that i need. You never know everything but over time the blanks get filled in.  ";;
"When I was first learning programming I would oscillate between feeling really dumb/confused and really sharp. Just got to hang in there and keep crackin'. Sounds like you haven't been at it for too long so I would say don't worry if doesn't 'click' yet. 

Also, not to be annoying but penultimate means 2nd to last... but I agree, penultimate SHOULD mean ultra-ultimate.";;
What have you tried (typed) into the shell so far and what kind of error(s) are you getting in PowerShell?;;
"I've only typed in 
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""Path"", ""$env:Path;C:\Python27"", ""User"")
and then I went on notepad to play around with the little basic ""print"" function, saved it as ex1.py. Then typed ex1.py into powershell but I keep getting a long message saying the file isn't recognized as a name of cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.";;
"Does the Python interpreter start if you just type ""python"" alone into Powershell?";;
"It will say: ""Python 2.7.10"" and then other details like a date and time and then ""on win32 type ""help"", ""copywrite"", etc and that's it.";;
"Good. That means Python is installed correctly. 

So the problem then is the shell finding where your file is located. Make sure your .py file is in the same directory as you are working in in Powershell, or specify the full directory e.g. ""C:\Users\Me\myfile.py"".";;
"No problem; that's why we're here!

A directory is like a folder, if you are familiar with Windows. It is a location, a path to where your file is.

For example, if I make/save a file called ""myfile.txt"" in ""My Documents"", then the actual directory for that file is ""C:\Users\Me\My Documents\myfile.txt"". Using visual folders and files was Microsoft's way of making directories more simple, graphical, and intuitive.

An easy way to check the directory of your file in Windows is to open up the folder where it is saved and click on the search bar at the top. This will reveal the full directory like so.

";;
"okay so I typed....""C:\Users\[MyName]\Documents\ex1.py"". It worked!!!!......for a half of a second. It brings up a new window for a second and then automatically goes away/exits before I even get to see whats on there.";;
"Good! Now just add ""python"" before your file directory and it should work. This passes your script to the Python interpreter which can read your code and output the result to the shell. So your shell command should look something like ""python C:\...myfile.py"" but with the directory you specified. ";;
OMG! It worked! Thank you so much for talking me through this! This is fun. :);;
"No problem. Glad to see more excitement for programming. 

One of us! One of us!";;
"Your positive attitude is very uplifting. Have fun, there's lots to learn and you can use your computer so much more efficiently and for so much more as a programmer.
";;
Ohhhhh.How do I know what directory? (Sorry for being such a noob). What is a directory? ;;
If you have installed python properly, you only have to write python filename.py;;
I guess I installed it wrong then. :( I don't know what I did.;;
"You say you only typed the name of the source file, and he said you have to type ""python filename.py"".
";;
"It just tells me ""no such file or directory'.";;
"And you are sure you typed the filename correctly relative to the directory you're in?
";;
What is a directory? ;;
"On computers, files are organised into named groups called directories. The file system is essentially one ""root"" directory, with directories inside, which in turn have directories inside and so on. To identify a file on the computer, you string together the names of all the directories, with the one containing the file itself as the last one in the string.

For example, on a Windows machine the hard drive C: will contain a directory called ""Users"" which in turn contains one directory for each user on the machine, each of which contains a ""Desktop"" directory which contains the files on the user's desktop. If your user name is ""LatinaAphrodite"", there will be a ""C:\\Users\\LatinaAphrodite\\Desktop"". The ""\\"" characters are there to separate the directory names from each other. The whole string is called a ""path"", and it identifies a specific file or directory on the computer.

At any time when you are in Powershell, you are standing in a directory on the computer. The path to that directory is shown as part of the prompt.

You can refer to any file (or directory) either by its ""absolute path"", starting from ""C:\\"" as above, or by its ""relative path"", which starts at the directory you're currently in. In such a case, you just type the remainder of the path. So if you're in ""C:\\Users\\LatinaAphrodite"", you can refer to a file ""something.txt"" on your desktop with the path ""Desktop\\something.txt"".

Does that answer your question?
";;
YES. Thank you! :);;
"Now then, when you created the file that you typed the Python code in, did you note where it said in the file picker box what directory you created the file in? That's the path (including the file name itself) that you want to type after ""python"" in Powershell to tell Python where to find the file.
";;
"I am assuming that running the command `python my_file.py` fails. If so, make sure to add Python to your path. 

Assuming that you have installed Python 2.7, open Powershell and run the following:

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""Path"", ""$env:Path;C:\Python27\;C:\Python27\Scripts\"", ""User"")

If you have installed Python 3.4, run the following instead:

    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(""Path"", ""$env:Path;C:\Python34\;C:\Python34\Scripts\"", ""User"")

Then, close and reopen powershell and try again.

Alternatively, if you don't feel like messing around with your file, just refer directly to the python executable to run your file by doing

    C:\Python27\python.exe my_file.py

...or:

    C:\Python34\python.exe my_file.py";;
It didn't work, that's something I already did.;;
"After reading through the other comments, it seems like the other commenters have pinpointed the problem. 

The problem isn't with Python -- it's that you're probably not in the correct folder or are not referring to the right file. Try running the `ls` command to make sure that you are in the correct folder and that the file you want to run is actually present there.";;
"Your API keys are unique. These are essentially your ""password"" to access an API. Why is this necessary? For one, it prevents everybody and their mother from spamming their API and getting/posting whatever data they want. Also, it allows them to track who is making the request to their API.

When you make an HTTP request, you need to include these in order to authenticate and be allowed access to their API.

You should never push these to GitHub (they're called secret for a reason!). You should source these as environment variables - if you keep all these variables in a file, make sure you include the file in your .gitignore so it is not pushed to GitHub.

"I'm learning how to do web development now too (also a CS student, but learning from the internet). I've been using ruby on rails as my back end, and at least with that I feel like your project sounds totally feasible. I can't really give you any specific advice on uploading an xlsx file, I'm planning on implementing that soon, but from what I've read it isn't very difficult, there's lots of plugins out there that make processing excel files easy.

Personally I don't like JS, so I wouldn't use Node, but that's a preference sort of thing. But if you don't already know it/have experience with it, I wouldn't use it. I also discovered coffeescript, which makes js a bit more tolerable.

For point 3, I hope you mean Node.js, not your front end js. That sounds like it's definitely back-end sort of job. 

From what I've done, starting from scratch with no knowledge of web development about 3 weeks ago (though a good amount of programming knowledge) I would guess that the project would take about a month or two, though that's based on my rails experience (and assuming you're not working on it full time, obviously).

Have you thought about where you're going to host the site? Pushing code to production seems like it takes a lot of time to setup, which I always feel is more of a pain than the actual programming. 
[](/GNU Terry Pratchett)";;
You can host it for free on Heroku. Deployment is very simple - you can even use their UI and deploy directly from a GitHub repo with very little setup.;;
Yeah, but they seem more expensive and less customizable than amazon hosting. I haven't looked into the details, but without ssh access, it seems like it would be harder to do things like install redis+resque to do work in the background. The extra work to deploy seems like it's worth it. Though maybe I missed something when I was looking at Heroku.;;
"[Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) lets you manage apps through the command line. They also have add-ons that are very easy to manage in the UI.

They offer a free hosting plan, the only catch is that it is slow and sleeps after not being used for an hour... Not an issue for something like this, it just takes a couple seconds to start up if you haven't accessed it in a while. But yes, pricing does get a little steep if you're looking into a production app that requires quality performance.

You can always deploy from the command line, or even set up auto-deploy when you push to a specified GitHub branch. It's definitely worth trying out";;
"While I'm all for using side projects as learning tools, I don't feel this is an appropriate place for the following reasons:  

* The project will be relied on by many people. Something goes wrong, you're to blame. 
* It will be a constant work in progress as you continue to fix bugs/ add features. Are you sure you'll still be wanting to do this for them a year down the road?
* You'd be re-inventing the wheel. Check out http://whentowork.com for a well rounded (even though the UI is outdated) scheduling site. Does everything you asked for and more. ";;
"These are all valid concerns.  I would be very clear with my employer that I am doing this just as a way to make it easier for the employees to view their schedule without constantly calling in for it, and that I in no way guarantee support for it down the road.  I already knew that there already existed such software; I just wanted something I can say I built myself and something I could put on my resume and show to prospective employers for example in an interview.
";;
"Yeah I totally understand the aspect of wanting something to show for it.  It's just that in my experience - which you can take with a grain of salt - taking on large volunteer projects especially when lots of learning is involved is a lose-lose for both parties.  I would recommend integrating a turn-key solution first and then build your project on the side.  Whentowork will certainly show you a good base of a well functioning system, and you will see areas in which it lacks (which it does have).  Then you can build yours to be the best of both worlds.  In my opinion, being able to show that you saw flaws in an existing system and took the initiative to implement them yourself is a better show of skill.  

Another thing to keep in mind is that servers cost money.  While you may be willing to host this now, what is going to happen down the road when this company is still using it on your servers and you no longer want to pay for it?  You *may* (IANAL) run into legal risk if you take it down, or if it crashes and you won't fix it.  Just things to consider.  ";;
"That is very feasible and I - believe it or not - used JS with Node.js and MongoDB to accomplish the exact same things you plan to do as a side project for my own CS department. The only difference was the front end showing events instead of a work schedule.

My advice would have to be: 

* Although you likely have a very good grasp of all the programming techniques required to do this, do not underestimate the hours it will require to pull off. The CSS formatting alone will drive you nuts if you are not an Art minor.

* I highly recommend you use [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/). It is a framework for Node.js that will simplify all the Node.js code you will need to write for your server, it even has a MongoDB module.

>The website then parse the schedule data into an HTML format and display the schedule in a nice table. (How would I do this)?

A ""database"" that simple is hardly worth the time investment into SQL. Arrays (*lists* in Python) will fit your purpose just fine.

Your program would be very easy to implement. 

I suggest learning Python and going through the basic datatypes, loops, etc etc. The CodeAcademy course will go up to and including file input/output and basic OOP principles. You don't necessarily have to use classes here, but you may find it helpful in organizing your code conceptually and avoiding repetition.

Thanks!;;
it is a fun game! What about adding time to the clock when the player creates a valid word? This could have diminishing returns, of course. ;;
Thanks! Yeah thats a good idea. I really want to try to mkae it more engaging with ideas like this;;
"There's a lot of opportunity for polish here:

* Why can't I use the keyboard to type words? This is really annoyance #1 -- if I was on a tablet, the interface is probably fine, but on a laptop, if I see a bunch of matches, it'd be nice to be able to type them all at once.
* It won't remember my name. I should be able to change it later, but I shouldn't have to type it every time. (Also, what do you do if I click ""cancel"" at the enter your name thing?)
* It's not obvious when the time runs out that my score has been counted. And it's not obvious what ""Take score"" does. Am I supposed to take the score before I'm out of time in order for it to count? Any sort of feedback when the game is over would help. (For example, take me to the leaderboard and show me where I ranked.)
* Reading the comments, I now understand that only the top words count, but I thought it was something fancier -- I know I typed ""Ram"" and ""Rams"" once, and only ""Rams"" counted, and I thought ""Does it only count the plural version, or if one word is inside another, only the longer word?"" You could fix this with animation -- show the word sliding from where I'm assembling it to the word list, show the list expanding to make room for it, show the bottom word falling off the bottom. Maybe put some deliberate blank spaces for words I haven't entered yet, so it's obvious at a glance how many words I still need to come up with.
* If you meant for it to count my top 8 highest words, you have an off-by-one error: I only see the top 7. But it's not obvious because...
* There's no feedback as to whether it accepted or rejected a word! This makes it hard to feel good about coming up with an obscure word, because it's not obvious whether it even counted or whether it just wasn't in the game's dictionary, or whether it *would have* counted but it wasn't worth more than the top 7 words I already have, or whether I already have that word.
* I think you might also have a bug -- someone reported it by setting their ""name"" to point it out in the score board, but I see it too -- where the score in the lower right stops updating when the words are full. So even if I add a new word and it's higher than all my existing words, it (apparently) doesn't affect my score. (There's an error in the console about this, too.)
* ...as I typed this, ""NIGGERBOT"" completely pwned your leaderboard, and is now topped with some (failed) XSS attempts. If you plan to leave this online, you need to do something about abuse. I'm really not sure exactly what, but something. At least you apparently aren't vulnerable to XSS. (I don't envy you this problem -- a mostly single-player, mostly-offline game with an online leaderboard is always going to be open to abuse, but it's way less fun without the leaderboard.)
* Nitpick: You could probably save some bandwidth by shipping the ""dict_obj.js"" as a list of words, instead of a dictionary. Then, on page load, build the dictionary by walking that list. Also, maybe avoid reloading the page every time I start a new game.
* A minor thing: Consider either scaling everything to the size of the viewport, or moving things closer together. On my screen, there's just a *ton* of whitespace between everything, and it really only looks right when shrunk to about a quarter of my screen. Fortunately, this is fixable -- when I use ctrl+mousewheel to zoom, everything scales appropriately.

I'd recommend watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg). Obviously, that's over the top, but that's my main point: You have a reasonable game, it doesn't really need that much of an explanation, but you absolutely *must* communicate what's happening visually. (Maybe also through sound, but I didn't have headphones plugged in.)

It was fun, though, and it works reasonably well other than the bugs mentioned. Not at all bad for a first browser-based game.";;
thanks for all the suggestions. I koind of thought there was going to be some way for someone to totally fuck the game up. do you have any insight into exactly how niggerbot did that?;;
Answered via PM, because I figured out how to do it easily enough that anyone here could. Didn't know if you wanted that just yet.;;
Do you think the abuse problem could be solved by moving more/most/all of the game's logic to the server instead of javascript?;;
"That would make it harder to abuse -- it'd require people to write a bot to play the game, rather than just uploading a final score and a username. Probably the simplest thing would be to have the server ship a set of letters to the client, then the client has to send back the same letters, the words the player found, and let the server compute the score.

There are moderately fancier things you could do that would be trickier -- for example, have the client send both the matches found and what it thinks the score is. Then, the server can still compute the score, catch cheaters and ban them.

To move *all* the game's logic to the server -- say, send every mouse click to the server and let it send UI updates back to the client -- would take a lot more resources. And to make it feel at all fast, you'd probably want something like websockets -- I'm not sure if those work on App Engine. (I'm guessing they do, I just don't know how.)

And ultimately, I could still write a bot. Preventing cheating is like DRM -- ultimately, it's probably going to rely on security through obscurity. I honestly don't have a ton of experience in this area -- I don't know what commercial games actually do (other than not be browser-based) to avoid this kind of abuse.

So... you could learn more about this, and experiment a bit, and see if you can prevent the bots from taking over. That would make for a fun arms race, and if you want something for your portfolio, the techniques you'd have to come up with to make this work would probably be a hell of a lot more technically challenging (and impressive) than just getting the game to work.

Or, you could declare this game done and learn what you can from it. (More and juicier visuals so the user knows what's going on, that kind of thing.) Take a break and watch some [Extra Credits](http://extra-credits.net/) episodes. Then, when you're ready, make another browser game, but focus on making an engaging single-player experience that *doesn't* need a leaderboard to be fun. For example, [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and [Candybox](http://candies.aniwey.net/) are two very compelling games (careful, you may lose a ton of time to them) that are fully moddable, where they don't really worry a ton about cheating. (Cookie Clicker even gives you an achievement for cheating yourself some cookies!)

Or, come up with a multiplayer game where scripting it wouldn't really gain much. For example, a turn-based strategy game -- you could have all the logic for that truly be server-side, and a bot probably wouldn't help much, because it's harder to just brute-force your way to a win. (Not a good idea for your second ever browser-based game, but that's the kind of direction I'm thinking.)

I think a multiplayer browser-based game could still be fun, but like I said, I think it's a lot harder. But coming up with a good idea for a compelling single-player game (that doesn't take too much effort, and where high scores don't matter) is hard, too. I don't actually have a recommendation about which way is better, just throwing out some suggestions.

Also, if you haven't, take a look at Node.js. It's a crazy hipstery world, but it has its advantages -- in particular, if you expect to have to move logic between client and server, or run it in both places, you can't easily run Python in a browser, but you can run JavaScript in a server.

Edit: Forgot to mention: I guess you could just CAPTCHA any high-score submission. That would get pretty annoying, though, and spammers have figured out how to break those by now.";;
Does the word list only accept a certain amount of words? After I submitted a certain amount, my score stopped going up and it only added words if they were more points than ones I had previously. Though I think it may be a bug because my final score seemed to count them.;;
Its designed to only count your top 8 highest words, is that what you're experiencing? ;;
"yeah i was confused about that too maybe a sidebar or something with rules would be nice
";;
"""Wordsmith"" is a pretty nice domain name. Is the es for spain?";;
thanks yeah it's Spain's country code domain;;
"If you want, you could make the game 100% predictable based on a given seed, and then at the end of a game have the player send a list of their commands. If you replay it on the server, you'll get their actual score. 

It's pretty much foolproof, but a lot of work. Might be a good programming project if you're willing to sink some time to learn, though.";;
I've read on stack about circumventing cheating, and someone mentioned that strategy. I can't help but think there's got to be an easier way..;;
There really isn't. Anything you put on the client, someone can easily read or reverse engineer to send their own data.;;
What about having all the game logic on the server, and each move makes a post request?;;
That's doable, but then you have to maintain a connection or deal with  dozens of post requests per player, per game.;;
Niggerbot? ;;

"Personally struggling mostly with low self-esteem and a short attention span. I get tired of the language I'm working on before I switch to something else and I can't seem to get through that gate of being a very beginning programmer, since I haven't learned enough to be able to play with it and make things I want to make.

Self-esteem is just a pervasive worry that I can't handle a degree in CS and that I can't handle a career. I'm good at learning languages in general (formal/programming or otherwise) but problem solving and critical thinking are two phrases that scare me to death.

I don't know if I need advice, but probably just a pep talk. :'(

"You'll learn it eventually!

Does [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6XtSPvjt87w) help? I made it a couple of weeks ago. 

";;
I really did enjoy that video! I liked hearing advice from people in recognizable positions. Ignoring the noise is a great one; I tend to be the kind of person who wants to do things right, the best way that I can do them, and I tend to run into a lot of conflicts telling me how I should do them. Zed Shaw says don't learn Python3, learn Python2. Well, I learned 3! HAH!;
I think it's important to realize everyone feels that same way. It's not you being retarded and not being able to figure it out while others can, it's just that you don't know how to approach a specific problem because you haven't found something that puts that aspect of it into perspective. Don't worry I'm a noob too and when you start learning certain things you'll get excited when whatever you thought would work actually works. What language are you focusing on now?;;
"I've hopped around from JavaScript to Python, and now C++ (I realy just started with C++ because I will be learning it at school in the fall and that killed my motivation to continue with Python for some reason!) So I haven't gotten anywhere with C++ that makes me uncomfortable.

While learning JavaScript and Python, I had no trouble with the language rules but just the problems I'd be given -- like crafting an algorithm to make a turtle draw a flower, or all the exercises in [this chapter of Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html#h_6xTmjj4Rf5), which is actually where I gave up on JavaScript for a while to move on to Python.

The good news is, the flower problem got me to start studying math again, since I have to better understand angles and geometry to figure out the instructions for drawing. I am determined, even when I'm discouraged. (:

Thank you for your insight. ""You don't know how to approach a specific problem because you haven't found something that puts that aspect of it into perspective."" This is really encouraging to me. When I come across these problems that melt my brain, I generally feel like I'm supposed to be able to know how to solve them without seeing an example, looking at the hints, etc. I am brilliant with things once I've been shown something similar. I still need to practice problem-solving from scratch. It's nice to acknowledge that it IS going to be very difficult if I haven't encountered a certain type of problem before.";;
"You have to understand what learning is and most people don't understand the theory behind what learning is at all. Essentially, you will only learn things that you can relate to other things that you already know. Think of it like this. If you're from a different planet and you've never seen a tree before and you ask me what leaves are, if I were to say its the green things on trees. How will you ever know what leaves are if you don't yet know what a tree is. With those high level brain frying math problems you've been given you've just been dropped on mars and told that in order to get back to earth, build a spaceship.

 It's important to have it in little building block chunks. My learning ability is extremely effective in comparison to everyone I know because of this concept that I've learned. The basic problem solving practice will ready you for other things. So take a step back and make those smaller problems seem stupid to you. Once they look stupid look for a bit harder problem to solve. Stay away from project euler and other math algorithm sites.

 I also suggest you learn what you want to learn in the long run. It's very demoralizing if you're forced to switch gears because some other factor comes into play. My guess is it'll be exactly like my friends class, he had a class that taught c++ he learned literally nothing. I would not focus my energy in that direction, just learn as the class goes on and if you've been learning python or this or that then you will in fact see how those algorithms that you've mastered(the little ones) will come into play and you'll understand how to go about it in another language. 

I learned c# for a while then switched to ruby because i wanted to learn ruby on rails and contribute to a beginner level project i found. I looked at ruby for 30 minutes and actually created a fix to the groups software and the theory I used was actually learned in c# i just had to look at what syntax to use really quickly to do the same thing.";;
[Here's a good pep talk about programming ability](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIJdFxYlEKE);;
This is fantastic!;;
Well I've learnt the syntax for java, python and javascript so far, what is challenging for me is jump from static functions to writing full software.... any ideas on where to start like projects etc.?;;
"Frameworks. Learn to use and love community made frameworks. 

Anything general worth programming someone has already done. Figure out what your project needs (gui, network support, file conversion, etc) and build off what someone else has already made.

All programming is taking something someone else has made and building on top of it, don't be afraid to use other's code!";;
Excellent advice! If you're doing web development, don't worry so much about all the new frameworks being released daily, just stick to what you're comfortable with at the moment and learn to use it well.;;
Do you have an idea for a project? What would you like to build? ;;
"> I'd like to build some web based application, anything at all, as i said i'm a noob. What I need to know is how to move to the next level outside syntax and simple functions

"If you're looking for building a web app, and know some python, I recommend learning http://flask.pocoo.org/ -- it is a web framework. 

Pick a small idea, and try to implement this. Something like name generator, or reddit client. 

I could help you choose, but this is probably better done using IM(so if you are interested, PM me your hangouts/jabber/skype/etc)";;
Have you taken a look at /r/dailyprogrammer? You might want to start off with simple exercises. It's much easier to try these sorts of exercises than trying to think of a new project and not knowing where to start.;;
Yep. The thing with the exercises given there is that they A) help you overcome the problem and bridge the gap of jumping from functions to large(er)-scale software, and B) the exercises are quite interesting and all have a potential to evolve into something larger.;;
Nice suggestion, some of these challenges are interesting. Brillant! (not brill-i-ant);;
"Look into ""architectural patterns"" like MVC (model-view-controller). They're ways of breaking your application up into separate parts with distinct jobs. ";;

How do you learn to navigate and understand larger code files? I'm still at the stage where I like to print code, highlight, make notes on paper. But with bigger projects, or looking at others' code, I'm not sure where or how to start. ;;
"It is an acquired skill, so the more you read other people's code the better you become at it. 

That said, my specific tip is this. Try to understand how data is organized: what classes are there, what data structures are used, how classes or objects are related to each other. THEN try to figure out what's going on with the data: where does it come from, how it is processed, etc. 

The control flow is often non-obvious, but you can easily see declarations of classes and often get some basic idea of how data is process. Then start ""reading code"" -- trying to actually figure out what's going on.

When I read other people's code I often draw graphs and diagrams on paper, and it helps. 

I am not sure if I'm clear here, if not, I'll try to explain this in a different way.";;
That was perfectly clear, thank you! ;;
Awesome! I'm glad that it helped! ;;
"Use an IDE. Many of them support declaration jumping, meaning I can hold the control key, click a variable or function and the ide will show where the variable was declared or where the function is defined.

This makes finding the ""meat"" of a portion of code much easier.";;
I'd recommend VS Code /u/civetservescoffee, it supports declaration jumping and you can see every time a field or class was referenced in the entire program. Super useful stuff, it's free, cross platform and pretty.;;
I did a quick google, VS as in Visual Studio? ;;
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a more lightweight alternative to Visual Studio (made my the same folks, Microsoft). It is also cross platform, and it will do everything you need and be less confusing to use IMO. It's my editor of preference!;;

Haha sorry I shouldn't acronymise so carelessly ;;
The hardest part of coding for me is not algorithmic, it's the IT side. I feel like I constantly have difficulty setting up pathing, getting a working IDE, and importing modules. Is setting up a new computer to code or setting up an old computer to code in a new language supposed to be a difficult, frustrating experience? I usually end up needing help from a friend. ;;
It can be frustrating for sure. Just remember, once you've get it set up, you can do the fun and important thing - making stuff. Don't be tempted to switch languages and/or frameworks before you make some stuff you are proud to show your friends - this'll cut down on the time you spend doing the shitty setup stuff!;;
"One idea might be to try virtualbox. You set up a base virtual machine (say, an ubuntu install) and then clone it, and work on the clone. Then if you want to do something else you can just make a new clone and work in it. That way you can have the basics handled and be able to switch gears really quickly.

I've been doing this with the lamp stack iso from turnkeylinux and using notepad++ and win scp to access the stack and test for learning php/mysql.

Plus side is that you get some familiarity with linux, too.";;
For the last two years at least I've been playing around ideas for a dream project of mine. I have so many ideas but I can't properly commit them to code. It's a framework, visual programming, interactive music+visual tool, that allows you to record your actions and play them back. I don't know how to make anything work. Every attempt (on my 4th now) has resulted in me abandoning it due to it not being designed right. It's not flexible. I cant always see it failing in the future. I don't even know what I want exactly. I don't know what libraries, frameworks to use. Or whether I should use Java or Javascript. I'm lost.;;
"I can only get a basic idea of the project you want to build. But maybe start with a subset of features. Ideally, pick a subset of features that is still fun, so programming can keep you engaging. Implement something small(a demo, a prototype) in a week/month and you'll have a much better idea of what to do next. 

As for languages, python is a safe choice for many things(including GUI and webdev). Javascript == doing things in a browser(though it is also possible to write backend stuff using node.js). Though if you know other languages, it may be better to stick to them.";;
Design is probably the hardest part about programming. Ideally you want each function to do one specific thing. If you find yourself copy pasting  code, you should turn that into a function or class. The only advice I can give is to keep going and eventually you'll figure out what makes a good design.;;
"For me at least, it can be easy to obsess over having ""well-designed"" code that feels right. If you can, try to finish a basic prototype of your project and then go back and make the code better later on.";;
"You might want to try some smaller projects to start. Something to scratch a very specific itch that you have. If you think about it as creating a tool for *yourself*, then you might suffer less stress about design quality.

Your confidence and expertise will go up by a **lot** every time you finish something.";;
Mostly the whole thinking process that comes along with  learning the syntax of the language. I feel like i'm a hard time tackling just the most basic problems.;;
"I think that is one of the most basic problems with the current way a lot of people are trying to learn to code. Syntax is just a very small part of development and a lot of people won't read about architecture at all. My usual tip is that beginners should read about tier architecture of a project and start to divide their projects accordingly. A lot of questions will answer themselves as soon as you try to divide your code in different tiers... and a lot of new questions will arise. ;)

In addition to that it is important to learn how different languages set up their projects. I recently changed from a C# place to a Java place. Switching the syntax wasn't the problem as Java and C# are very much alike, but the way the projects are created, stored, referenced and configured was very different.";;
"It's mostly not knowing what to do with it. Every single time I sit down with the idea to learn a language. The same questions come up.

What exactly am I going to do with this? Just following lessons on code-academy or a similar site is good to learn syntax and things like that. But it's nothing more then a start. Code-academy won't teach you everything you need.

People say that you need to do programming to learn it really. But whenever I try thinking of a project I'm just struggling to even find a way to aproach a project. How to get started.";;
What's your current/favorite idea for a project? Maybe I could give you specific advice.  ;;
"might sound a bit ambitious. But I wanted to build a game. Games and how they are build are the reason I got interested in programming in the first place.

Maybe you should look into the FOSS world. Become a user of a few projects, lurk on the community for a while, and figure out what you need to be able to do to contribute. In a litte while, you will have shipped something that people actually use. ;;
"What is FOSS? I'm assuming it stands for free opensource software. But my google search mostly turns up research projects concerned with architecture.

What would be good places for me to get into such a community?";;
"free/open source software is community based. A programmer will put a project and all of the source code up online. Others may build off of the code for their own project or submit changes and improvements (via pull request).

Not really stuck, but I'm learning to create classes classes that extend existing classes in Android to make things do things the way I want them to do.

"Try working on smaller projects/on projects that don't really require too many libraries. 

Also try and spend some time before you start coding just planning out your program. Sit down with a pencil and paper, take your program, and just start breaking it apart into smaller and smaller subproblems and steps. What you want to do is keep dividing your program up until you end up with pieces that are small enough for you to manage.

Something else you could try is doing some exercises on /r/dailyprogrammer -- they're basically small, mini-projects. If you're stuck, see how other people broke the problem apart + solved it, take notes, and try applying the same techniques to the next program. ";;

So I have been learning Java but I found my goal after starting (not that long ago still working on my first book), I want create a program that will interpret data from an iOS text message (specifically a phone number, address, price quote and basic notes) and feed it into the drop down menus and text feilds of an existing php based website. Where should I start, do I need to learn php to interact with it? since I am already learning java would it be worth just forwarding everything to an android, would interface be easier on android or about the same?

I feel like, I can learn it, but I need a good teacher, reading books just don't cut it.;;

Are you intending on centering horizontally? Have you set a width on the element?;;
Yeah, horizontally. I gave both the div and the image it's in widths, and it's close to center but slightly off. I think it's because my HTML and CSS is kind of a mess of divs inside other divs and stuff like that. ;;

"Two things: First, learning a technology that isn't going to be completely changed and/or deprecated in the next year.

If you do a course like this (coursera, Edx, etc.), its best to keep up. Don't fall behind. Do all the exercises (and more). Don't skimp. If they want you to write tests for your code, write the tests (and more). If you get stuck, ask a question in the course forum. This looks like quite an advanced course you've started. I would not recommend anyone start an advanced course unless you've already written several working projects; even if they are small projects.

What do you believe the best way to plan a project is? I usually start with the data-structures and try to make the public methods match what is needed by other classes and/or structs, but that often leads to me constantly re-writing.;;
"> but that often leads to me constantly re-writing.

This doesn't sound too abnormal. Some rewriting would happen regardless of approach taken. 

That said, if you feel like you're rewriting too much, maybe you shouldn't do a lot of planning? So you could start with a very rough prototype, get it done quickly and then add features on top of it. And instead of trying to predict what methods would end up necessary, you implement methods only when you actually need them. 

I guess this could be called [YAGNI or KISS](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?YouArentGonnaNeedIt)

This isn't a silver bullet, and some refactoring/rewriting is definitely normal. ";;
"I figured some wasn't abnormal, but sometimes I'm refactoring a lot more than I'm writing new stuff.

I'll try just writing methods when I realize I need them. Sounds so simple, not sure why I didn't think of that.";;
Instead of re writing, why not just extend the original class you created and overload the method you need to change? Then it's well organized and you don't need to rewrite as much;;

Then I would Google things that would make the app better like ""run a method every 5 minutes android"" which would get the app to update automatically, then ""getting input from user android"" which allows the user to specify the stock they want.

Yeah, there is a disconnect between what universities teach and what people want to build and learn. You should probably learn this on your own. 

> Do I learn Web design? Is there a certain framework or language I should master? I really have no idea.

Well, if you want just keywords, then you need html/css and js on front-end. Typically you don't use raw html/css, and stick to a framework(e.g. boostrap for html/css) and jquery(for js stuff). You could learn these. You can get a decent looking website just by using vanilla bootstrap(the downside is that it will end up looking kind generic).

As for backend, your framework depends on your language, e.g. if you like python, learn flask or django, and if you like ruby, learn rails or sinatra.";;

"> How do I take a few python files and turn them into something that people can use?

On Linux or OS X (or other unix-like OSes) users just run your scripts. Python is either comes pre-installed or you can easily install. As for installing your scripts, people typically use pip(package manager for python) or system-wide package mannager(e.g. apt-get/dpkg). 

Sometimes people simply put their code on github(and other people just run git clone to get the code). 

> What happens between writing the basic scripts and turning them into proper pieces of software that can be downloaded?

So, not that much happens! You just put your code on github(which is often good enough!). And if you really want, you can create a pip package. Pip packages are pretty simple too: http://www.scotttorborg.com/python-packaging/minimal.html

If it a part of standard library, then yes. If it is not, then you need to tell how to download the module.

Debugging: part of programming life, and an especially painful part of learning. **Are there any checklist/guidelines on how to go about checking code when things don't work?** (Besides reading it over and over again...) I find this is the part that causes the most frustration because causes can be varied and as a beginner sometimes I don't really know what I don't know. (I'm learning JS, so that maybe makes it worse?)";;
"First, I'm assuming that you know about the existence of the developer tools/web console? If you don't, I would start there. Whenever my JS doesn't work, I always start by checking the developer console to see if there's an error message there. Most syntax errors are caught at this point.

If you do know about that and it isn't helping, then a systemic and scientific approach can often be helpful.

As a general rule of thumb, bugs in software are a result of when your **assumptions** about the code do not match up with **reality**. As a consequence, debugging is less about finding what's wrong about the code, but figuring out which of your assumptions were wrong. (And this is one of the reasons why debugging is hard -- once people make assumptions, it can often be psychologically hard to confront, examine, and abandon them)

At the most high-level, you're starting with the assumption that your code works correctly, which is obviously untrue if you need to debug. So then, your next question should be to ask yourself _at what point_ does your code starting doing the wrong thing/your assumptions start to diverge?

Think of code as a river. It starts somewhere and starts flowing downward. If somebody dumps a bunch of trash in at some point (if there's a bug), everything from that point downstream is going to be contaminated:

    ----------------------------------------------
    start -> -> -> garbage! -> dirty water! -> end
    ----------------------------------------------

So then, one useful technique to try and isolate where exactly the bug begins is something called ""binary debugging"". If we start off with the river metaphor, all we know that your flow of code and data has become contaminated somewhere, and we want to pinpoint where. So one technique is to add `console.log()` statements around the middle of your code, print out your variables, etc and check to see whether or not your code is functioning properly at that point.

So for example, let's say that when you click a button, you expect for your code to read the value from the text box, put that value into a JSON object, then send that over the server. 

Well, one test you can do is to check and see if your function is being called in the first place by putting a single `console.log()` at the top. If it's called, you know that the problem must be somewhere inside your function. If it isn't, you know that the problem must originate before your function is ever called. Bam, we've just eliminated the probability space of errors in half. 

Now, put another `console.log` in the middle of your method and print out all the variables. If they're exactly what you expect, then bam, you know that the problem must originate even later in that method. If not, then you know that the problem must occur before. We've cut the lines of code we need to check in half again. 

If you keep repeating this, you'll either discover the problem, or narrow the issue enough that you can ask for help and present a small enough snippit of code where people will be willing to answer it.

This technique is even more powerful if you try taking the mindset of a scientist and try applying the scientific method. First, form a hypothesis about where the code is. Then, instead of just reading the code or speculating about what the problem might be, _collect data_, either by using the binary debugging technique, by just tossing in `console.log` statements everywhere, or by using a debugger. (Other techniques include commenting out everything except the code you want to test, making a simpler version of your program, manually typing in your code line by line into the web console to see what it does, etc...) Then, as you collect data, ask yourself if it validates or invalidates your hypothesis, make a specific log, and keep making more and more specific hypotheses. 

Taking this sort of rigorous approach + clearly defining what you expect to happen on a smaller and smaller scale is a good way of forcing yourself to determine what exactly your assumptions are, and determine when they've been violated. This way, even if you have no clue what the problem is, you can at least determine what the problem _isn't_. 


";;
"Thanks for the detailed response!

I've been exactly what you said, and it's definitely helpful. Do you any advice going beyond this though? 

Console error messages are often more cryptic to the beginner than informative, and I've found that I've usually no clue if the error is due to a typo, a misunderstanding of some concept on my part (leading to a misuse of a statement etc.), or program structure that doesn't work etc.

Perhaps there's really no other way except patience and experience (and good old console.log)?";;
"In general, if an error message is completely cryptic + googling it doesn't seem to turn up anything at all relevant to your problem, then the issue is usually some sort of syntax error (ie a typo). Basically, what's happening is that the computer is trying to interpret the symbols and letters you typed in, gets confused, attempts to keep trucking along, then ends up failing somewhere down the line.

If that happens/you suspect you have a syntax error, then try looking at not only the line the error is occurring on, but the preceding 2-3 lines.

However, JavaScript _is_ notoriously fuzzy/bad at giving clear error messages. Other languages are usually better at this sort of thing, but specifically for JavaScript, I recommend using [jshint.com](http://jshint.com/). Basically, copy-paste your code, and it'll run a basic syntax and style check over it. 

You may have to fiddle with the options (click the ""configure"" button in the top-middle) -- for example, if you're using jQuery, you'd want to click the ""Assume jQuery"" option.

One thing to note is that it'll mix together stylistic warnings with syntax errors. While you should eliminate all warnings, you may run into cases where you have differences of opinion, and may not want to adopt the style recommendation.

A similar website you may run across is [jslint.com](http://www.jslint.com/) -- it's basically the exact same thing, except even more opinionated. I personally prefer jshint, since I disagree with several of jslint's opinions + jslint doesn't seem to support jQuery, but it might be good to check against both websites.

If your code passes jshint and/or jslint with no warnings (perhaps apart from a few style ones), then you can be almost 100% sure that your code has no syntax errors + the mistake is a conceptual one and is due to an error in your logic. 

And now that I think about it, when there's a bug in your JS code, it's probably a good idea to try running your code through these websites first before doing the full debugging/scientific method approach I outlined earlier.";;

"so i started about two weeks ago coding a blog. i decided on the django framework since it had best documentation out of all. i coded the models, views, rendered them to a template, wrote a quick css outline etc. the site has a few features i need to research/learn how to create/implement then sharpen up the UI and i'll have my first ever webpage. the content of the blog is still a well i have to think about that.

Yep. Your first program/website will be absolute shit (and the same goes for your second and third and fourth...)

Don't worry too much whether or not your code is good or bad. As long as you have the desire to improve and get better, and act on that desire, you're on the right track.

> a lot of my work has been google tutorial assist should i still feel proud?

Yep -- even advanced programmers will spend a lot of time googling and researching. In fact, it's normal to spend more time googling then actually coding.

As long as you make sure to take the time to really read and understand everything you run across, and never just blindly copy-paste code you find, you should be good.

"When you run into code you just can't understand, here are some strategies for figuring out what happens.

1. Instead of trying to understand the entire thing at once, go line by line, and try and understand exactly what each line does before moving on to the next. Pick one sample input, and see what happens as you run through the code.
2. Whenever you run into a method or function you've never seen before, google what it does. If you run into a line of code which uses lots of special characters that are hard to google, do your best to search for it, but then post a question here on /r/learnprogramming once you get stuck. (Be sure to mention that you tried googling/what search queries you tried so that people won't flame you + will suggest better search queries for the future).
3. If you're using a compiled language like Java or C++, add print statements after each line printing out your variables. If you're using an interpreted language like Python or JavaScript, either do the same thing or run your code line by line in a REPL. Basically, rather then trying to guess what your code does, go out and actually _see_ what it does.
4. Try tracking what happens to each of your variables and such on pencil and paper. Sometimes, having to physically write things down and change values will give you a very strong insight into what's happening.
5. You might not be able to understand all of the code, but you _can_ at least understand most of it. Break up the code into smaller chunks, and try and understand one chunk at a time.
6. Within your code, write down all the things that you _know_ to be true as comments. For example, if you know in the middle of your code that the value of the variable `x` _must_ be positive and will represent the x-coordinate of some object, write those things down as comments.
7. Approach reading code with the mindset of a scientist, and apply the scientific method. Your basic steps should be:
    1. Make a hypothesis (ie something like ""I think these lines of code do X"" or ""if I plug in Y, I will get Z as an output"")
    2. Formulate an experiment to collect data to prove or disprove your experiment. (ie add print statements, use the debugger, individually run lines of code, etc...)
    3. Run your experiment to collect that data
    4. Explicitly note down, either in a text file or in a notebook what you observed, if your hypothesis was true or false, or what the data you collected indicates. (You're basically learning how to be detail-oriented)
    5. Repeat, starting from step 1. Depending on how you like to approach things, you should either start with really detailed hypothesis + trying to understand how single lines work at a time and build up, or should start with general ones and drill down getting more and more specific
7. And when all else fails, ask a question here on /r/learnprogramming. Detail everything you've discovered so far/what you _thought_ your code was doing + your reasoning. When people give you responses you don't understand, keep pushing + asking questions until you're satisfied.";;

"> One of the best things about school, love it or hate it, is that it puts things into a hierarchy so you can learn the structure and use what you've learned to learn more.

One way to get that structure might be to visit the web pages for the CS departments at different universities and look at their curriculum/courses -- many classes/schools put all their assignments, lecture slides, and coursework online. At the very least, it'll at least give you an idea of what sorts of things you should be studying, and in what order.

I would couple that with just constant googling. Any question you would ask a person, just try googling, and rinse and repeat until you've gotten the answers you were looking for.

> Apparently it's more of a refresher site rather than a teaching site.

It's not so much a refresher site -- it's more of an _introduction_ to programming. It's great at introducing people to programming and getting them started with the basics, but doesn't do a very good job of helping people move on to an intermediate level. As a result, what many people will recommend is to supplement Codecademy with a more comprehensive tutorial/course afterwards.

> I've made two different webpages but never a full site, because I don't know how, and none of them are published because I don't know any backend anything and i'm very unfamiliar with hosting.

I would honestly just start off by purchasing hosting, purchasing a domain, and clicking around and exploring the menus. Basic hosting websites are actually set up so that you can do a surprising amount just by clicking and exploring the menus (and googling each of the terms you see). To get you started, after purchasing a domain and webhost, what you should do is google ""how to upload files to [your-webhost] via ftp"". 

I would personally recommend either BlueHost or Namecheap -- they're both reliable and pretty standard. Their support articles are also decent.

> I also have a problem with terminology like methods, functions, events, event handlers, etc and issues with things like browser differences and other issues that i've heard of but can't even remember. 

I would start off by going over how functions work. After picking out a tutorial (the FAQ has links to multiple), go through it from start to finish, and they'll be sure to cover functions in loads of details. 

Then, ideally, the tutorial should later move on to talking about objects and object oriented programming (OOP). Do spend a good amount of time learning about that too.

After you learn how those two things work, it'll be much easier to learn about and pick up a lot of the concepts you're mentioning. Understanding how functions work and how object-oriented programming works are both sort of ""pre-requisites"" towards being able to understand many more advanced concepts.

I would also try and start with a Python or Java tutorial. This is mainly because I haven't met a single online resource for JavaScript that teaches how OOP works in a way I find pedagogically satisfying -- they all seem to get caught up on teaching the quirks/unusual way JavaScript approaches OOP without ever actually teaching the underlying concept. Python tutorials and Java tutorials seem to do a much better job at this.

As for browser differences, it's honestly not something people go out of their way to deliberately learn. Rather, what happens is you make a website, you test it on different browsers, discover it doesn't work on one of them, and go on a googling/researching spree for like an hour or two, discover something, and memorize it since you never want to have to go through the pain of googling again. 

(If you're wondering why many developers seemed to have a hatred for Internet Explorer, this is why. Thankfully, their latest versions have been getting much better, and the state of modern browsers in general is much much much better then it used to be 3-4 years ago).

Another good website to check is [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/). Whenever I run into a feature I want to use but am not sure if it's supported by all browsers, I just google ""caniuse [whatever]"" and will get a definitive answer that way.

"Wow. I honestly didn't expect a response but you're reply is fantastic. I honestly hadn't thought about exploring any universities online CS curriculum to get a path carved out. That may be what I need to keep myself on track.

As far as googling and research goes I do that. In fact I've been fairly active on this subreddit because I find much less scrutiny for my novice level understanding here than other sites like stack overflow. My last experience here didn't go so well when I asked about [CSS child combinator selectors](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/3bsmqq/child_and_descendant_selectors_css/) but regardless this sub has offered me much more than most.

I knew codecademy couldn't be my only resource and that I need to eventually move on regardless of whether the new resource clicks with me or not. I've been on codeschool and Udacity's free courses and read through all sorts of documentation but never really stuck with it long enough to retain anything. So I suppose the next step is to sit down, shut the fuck up and do what needs to be done.

Hosting still seems like it's a far cry away from my level but i'll look into publishing what i've made and hopefully it won't blow up in my face. I honestly know little to nothing about backend development and hosting but i'm willing to learn. Maybe once i'm used to it i'll even be able to make one of them into something decent. 

I feel like I know what each individual term is but not by definition. I've worked on Java applications with OOP and i've made plenty of JS functions but I'm never sure when to call something what it is. My problem is recognizing what I'm doing. Sometimes I know exactly what to do but not what it is that i'm doing if that makes sense. This mostly causes an issue with research purposes.

I've already had a browser issue actually. I used caniuse.com to try and troubleshoot it too and turned up nothing. I was using CSS transform property and I noticed that Safari and Chrome share the -webkit- prefix. Chrome worked fine but Safari didn't. I've tried googling the problem but can't seem to find anything.

"> Wow. I honestly didn't expect a response but you're reply is fantastic. I honestly hadn't thought about exploring any universities online CS curriculum to get a path carved out. That may be what I need to keep myself on track.

Sounds good. Just as a side note (since you're likely to run into this issue), most CS curriculum online will focus on teaching more computer science or software engineering related stuff, and will focus on things like theory, data structures and algorithms, operating systems, databases, etc... As a result, web development is usually a single class (though a whole cluster of related topics are taught through taking various other classes).

So as a result, if you're looking to focus on just webdev for the moment, you should try and look for those individual classes and not necessarily on the curriculum as a whole. 

> As far as googling and research goes I do that. In fact I've been fairly active on this subreddit because I find much less scrutiny for my novice level understanding here than other sites like stack overflow. My last experience here didn't go so well when I asked about CSS child combinator selectors[1] but regardless this sub has offered me much more than most.

Sounds good! 

Yeah, StackOverflow can be a bit intense -- they have high standards, both for askers and answerers. As for this subreddit, I've also seen that the quality of responses will be a little hit and miss, but I'm glad to see that it seems to be mostly working out for you.

> I knew codecademy couldn't be my only resource and that I need to eventually move on regardless of whether the new resource clicks with me or not. I've been on codeschool and Udacity's free courses and read through all sorts of documentation but never really stuck with it long enough to retain anything. So I suppose the next step is to sit down, shut the fuck up and do what needs to be done.

Basically, yeah -- I'm a firm believer in project-based learning. Just reading about things can be a bit abstract/hard to internalize. 

> Hosting still seems like it's a far cry away from my level but i'll look into publishing what i've made and hopefully it won't blow up in my face. I honestly know little to nothing about backend development and hosting but i'm willing to learn. Maybe once i'm used to it i'll even be able to make one of them into something decent. 

If you don't feel quite up to looking at hosting yet, it's definitely something you can delay investigating. It's not crucial by any means, and you can always test locally. It also costs some money (at minimum about ~15-20 dollars a year?), so it may be worth waiting a little until you have something you feel like actually putting up online.

Also, as a note, learning how basic hosting works is more a matter of digging through menus/googling terms, while learning how to write a backend is more a matter of programming. As a result, it would be best if you thought of them as two entirely separate things. You can definitely learn how to do one without learning about the other (and setting up basic hosting is way easier then learning how to write a working backend).

> I feel like I know what each individual term is but not by definition. I've worked on Java applications with OOP and i've made plenty of JS functions but I'm never sure when to call something what it is. My problem is recognizing what I'm doing. Sometimes I know exactly what to do but not what it is that i'm doing if that makes sense. This mostly causes an issue with research purposes.

Something that might help is to just start browsing StackOverflow questions. If you pick random tags (such as the 'JavaScript' tag or the 'HTML' tag), sort the questions by votes, and look at the top-voted questions, you'll see a bunch of really insightful questions and answers. 

You can then branch out by doing the same thing for any tags that look interesting + by looking at the related questions list to the right. 

I found that doing this was a surprisingly good way of ""learning about what I don't know"" and filling in those gaps in my knowledge. Many of the questions will ask things you may have struggled to articulate, or bring up issues you never even thought of. 

I still do this on a regular basis -- I browse StackOverflow when I have a spare moment/when I'm on the bus or something.

> I've already had a browser issue actually. I used caniuse.com to try and troubleshoot it too and turned up nothing. I was using CSS transform property and I noticed that Safari and Chrome share the -webkit- prefix. Chrome worked fine but Safari didn't. I've tried googling the problem but can't seem to find anything.

CSS can be pretty finicky -- there's a chance that the issue might even be unrelated to your transforms in general. Try posting a question about it, if you haven't already?

I love HTML and CSS, but haven't even thought about jQuery or JavaScript. 
I'm really new in programming, but I have some skills with HTML and CSS. My project is weird. I was chatting on skype and then I got an idead, why would I sit in front of a computer, doing nothing so I started programming design of skype on computer. It will have no function, but it will look like it's skype in web browser. I've put about 10h into it, for now. And didn't do a lot. I'm struggling with dropdown menus, because they just doesn't work, or design...I'm a bit afraid of what will come after those menus, the chat field or field where you select/add contacts. I want to finish it, but I think I will give up before I will be half way through.  
Just so you can have an idea what I want to do: http://imgur.com/FL8FZWC including all http://i.imgur.com/bPJ6mST  
Has anyone tried to do something similar to me?

EDIT: corrected spelling and added screenshots";;
I think you should try looking in various HTML/CSS frameworks/libraries. For example, bootstrap has nice dropdowns: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#dropdowns;;
"Managed to make dropdown menus, but now they are moving with menus, after few hours of googling I think I'll figure it out.  
Isn't that programming all about? :P";;
I've been struggling with refactoring the code. The codes' work, but inefficient or messed up. I don't know how to refactor the code to make it more readable and working efficiently without major quirks.;;
"Optimize for readability, not performance. Does it really matter if you program is 2x slower? Sometimes it does, but often you don't really need maximum efficiency. 

Also, check your code in profiler to make sure you're actually eliminating bottle necks.";;
"Not really a beginner, but:

Got any recommendations on how to debug bigger software platforms like Magento?

I know its architecture and usually understand the code, but this week it did take 6 hours for me to find out that a source of a horrendous bug was that a SMALLINT column in some SQL table had a default value of 2 instead of 0.

Of course I can't seriously sell this time to a client...";;
I don't know Magento, so maybe my tip won't really work here. But I am working with a bigger platform, too and when we get a bug then we won't start a big debugging session, we will create a test to verify the bug and that usually brings us a lot closer to the bug than debugging every single part of our software. ;;
"Is it because you should return the number of characters copied but you return `-EFAULT`?
";;
Actually, `copy_from_read` returns zero here. So it copies all the bytes successfully and never return `-EFAULT`.;;
"copy_from_read isn't whats being called in the code.

Anyway, have you looked at what's actually in the array.  I would print out byte by byte with printk to see if what's actually in that array is what you expect";;
"`buf` prints absolutely correct in the case of whole string copy. Anyway, here is definitions of `BUFF_LEN` and others. May be I am missing something here:
    
    #define BUFF_LEN 12
    
    #define MY_TEST_ID ""s03324156763""
    static char kbuffer[BUFF_LEN] = MY_TEST_ID;
    ";;
"So you are assigning a 13-char value to a 12-char array?
";;
"it seems kbuffer is not large enough to hold the \0 of that string

also check the return value as the other poster mentioned";;
"OK, but in the first version where you copy only one char, you return 1, not 0. So what is the meaning of the returned value?
";;
I am returning 1 indicating the number of bytes I copied this time. The moment I have read all the characters in my `kbuffer` string, I return 0 to kernel saying that I have read everything and I am done. It just prints `buf` then on terminal.;;
"Can we see the code that calls this function?
";;
I just do this: `cat /sys/kernel/debug/test/TestFile`. ;;
"Yes but you claim to know how the returned value is treated by the caller, so presumably there is some calling code which you have at least read even if you haven't written it?
";;
Okay, pardon my stupidity, but no, I have no idea. It *just* works.;;
"The whole point of your post is that it doesn't work; the caller does not do what you expect it to do, namely it doesn't print the string when you thought it should. So it seems reasonable to take a look at what the caller does, specifically how it interprets the returned value. Or if you want a quick check, try doing the same thing in your second piece of code as in your first one: first return `BUFF_LEN` on the first call and update the offset, and then return 0 on the second call. Does something different happen then?
";;
"Oh yes, thank you, thank you.

But another question. I hope you don't mind.

Concretely, why does the kernel calls the read function twice? I also used this definition of `read`

    return simple_read_from_buffer(buf, length, offset, &kbuffer, BUFF_LEN);


And in both cases, I get the following from `strace`

    read(3, ""s03324135655\0"", 65536)        = 13
    write(1, ""s03324135655\0"", 13)          = 13
    read(3, "", 65536)                      = 0

I understand what `read` and `write` are upto. What I don't understand is why does not the kernel completes copying the buffer during the first call and just returns zero there and then. After null terminating character there is not going to be any other character and we have done reading the string.
";;
"That's too vague. ""Server to test on"" could mean many things. It might be a simple VPS to execute code on, a CI server, or something else.

A server isn't really necessary, though. Almost anything you can do on a server can be done locally. For most people, the only exception is make a site accessible to others online, since most home ISP plans probably don't have the needed static IP.";;
You can always install a server on your own machine if you just need to test things.;;
If I remember the thread correctly, you might be thinking of [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for deployment of web applications.;;
"My opinion of cloud IDEs:

They're great for teaching, and are sometimes necessary (for example, if you own a chromebook or a very old/slow computer, you basically _have_ to use them), but I wouldn't over-rely on them + use them as my primary development tool.

This is for several reasons:

1. I want to be able to keep working when I have no internet. (For example, what if I'm taking the bus? What if I'm at a conference and the wifi gets overloaded?)
2. Learning how to set up and install your tools can be valuable, and though learning to debug issues with your setup can be incredibly annoying, will teach you a lot.
3. I don't like being locked down to one system + having my code basically live on somebody else's servers.
4. You can't use an IDE when working on the cloud -- you're stuck with whatever editor they come up with.

I would stick with them for now since you're in the middle of your course. Pre-configured IDEs are a good way of avoiding [yak-shaving](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YakShavingDefinedIllGetThatDoneAsSoonAsIShaveThisYak.aspx) and [command-line bullshittery](http://pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm) -- as a beginner, you want to avoid as many distractions as possible. 

But as you get more advanced, you're inevitably going to have to learn how to shave that yak + deal with bullshittery, and after a certain point, people will expect that you know how to do so.

> Are cloud IDEs used in the field of professional programming?

Not really. Most people either work directly on their computer, or ssh into their computer. This is partly because companies don't like to be over-reliant on any single service, and partly because developers tend to be really picky about their work environment + setup -- forcing people to use Cloud IDEs would probably cause a riot.";;
I haven't used any, but don't really want to. Latency of actions would be annoying. It's also easier to work when I have all my resources locally and can use whatever programs I want on them. If a file has to be processed with a different program, I'd have to download, change, and re-upload the file for it to work on a cloud IDE. Ew.;;
"I travel a lot and have a few (small) side projects I'm working on. I use Nitrous and really like it. Prior to Nitrous, I also used C9 so I'll do my best to answer your quesitons.

* I recommend Nitrous. I liked C9 but my terminal tab would regularly become unresponsive. I was wasting too much time reloading the window/resetting the box to try to fix the terminal issue. I haven't had any issues with Nitrous, granted, it's about $10/mo.
* If using the same workstation isn't too much of a hassle, I'd recommend just using that.
* The biggest pro for me is the flexibility to work from various devices and not need to worry about replicating the dev environment on various systems. I also occasionally work from a tablet so this is convenient. The biggest con is how slow they can be. From my experiences, automated testing is veryyyy slow, and the normal response times when viewing the demo application is very slow.
* I'm sure they have their place with those who work remotely/on-the-road, etc. I really wouldn't use it though if I didn't have to. The latency/lack of resources on cheaper services can make the whole process very slow. Testing, my god, is horrible.
";;
"Plenty of professionals don't use any IDE at all; I know off-hand a few RoR devs that are using VIM with some IDE-like plugins but it's still really far from a full IDE. 

Specific to webapp IDEs: Don't trust others when you don't have to. The more detached you are from the decisions of others in your workflow, the less likely it is your workflow will be interrupted. If some web service decides to change the layout, functionality or price you just kind of have to deal with it. If you use a binary that runs on your own machine - especially one for a well established editor or IDE, you can pretty safely assume you won't ever have it pulled out from under you.";;
"Some thoughts:

* I personally don't like cloud IDEs because cloud computing is a dangerous technology to trust in general.  Most of the power lies with the service provider, rather than with you.
* Cloud IDEs won't work if you don't have a stable internet connection.
* Almost all cloud IDEs are laggy and slow even with high-speed internet.  In general, cloud services cannot deliver the user experience of a native desktop application (e.g. gmail vs Outlook, google docs vs MS Office/OpenOffice) due to latency.
* For professional programming, many IT departments will shoot down cloud IDEs for security reasons.  Many companies cannot allow their proprietary code and data to live outside their walls, so any ""cloud"" IDE would have to live within the company itself.  That is, the cloud needs to be self-hosted.

The one thing I like are ""online compilers"" when I need to try out something real fast.  They can be a lot faster than opening up a local IDE and figuring out how to compile, and they can run untrusted code (such as the code we might find from an OP in a /r/learnprogramming question).

That said, using a cloud IDE for an online course does also make a lot of sense.  When teaching introductory programming, not making the user have to install a bunch of stuff removes a lot of barriers.";;
"IMHO your UML Class Diagrams are too abstract.

Take inspiration by [Iluwatar's Java Design Patterns](https://github.com/iluwatar/java-design-patterns/) who basically uses the same concept to explain design patterns, but his explanations match the diagrams and are practically oriented. ";;
"These were the same UML diagrams from the Design Patterns book, but I will get on gliffy and get some custom UMLs drawn up in the next few days for these tutorials! 

Thanks for the feedback!";;
I understand that these were the UML diagrams from the Design Patterns book, but the diagrams should match the code otherwise they are pretty much useless.;;
In practice, you would rarely be using a lot of theoretical CS concepts, especially if you are doing stuff like test automation, so I doubt that it's really necessary to relearn the concepts, as you can just look them up if the need arises. ;;
Look in the sidebar there is many resources for each of them which are good;;
"Some resources I recommend:

- [HTMLDog](http://htmldog.com/) -- it's a no-bullshit overview of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
- People are probably going to give me flack for this, but if you're interested in learning HTML and CSS, I personally like [w3schools.com](http://www.w3schools.com/). I think it does give a good cookbook-like overview of how to use HTML and CSS + makes for a decent reference, at least at the beginning level. 
- The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web) (MDN) has one of the largest and most comprehensible overviews of web development around (for example, see it's [Re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript) guide).
- [Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/javascript/) -- gives you a whirlwind tour of JavaScript syntax. 
- JavaScript can often be a loose and fuzzy language, and for me, [JavaScript, the Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596517742) was the first resource I encountered which took a rigorous approach to teaching JavaScript -- it's a personal favorite of mine.
- [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) is a good, intermediate-level guide to JavaScript.

So, I would start with HTML and CSS, and skim through those tutorials fairly quickly, and move on to trying to make an actual website just using those two. I think the act of making a website is going to end up teaching you far far far more then just reading the tutorials -- CSS in particular will seem deceptively simple, but can get very gnarly and quirky when you try and do something complex in it (for example, try making a navbar with a drop-down menu).

For JavaScript, I think you're going to find picking up the syntax + using it to do basic tasks to be fairly easy, given you have prior programming experience, but that there are a lot of quirks that makes doing more complex tasks confusing. I think that the Reintroduction to JavaScript article and Eloquent JavaScript both do a good job of introducing the concepts to learn how JavaScript likes to do things.";;

"Well... It's hard to get you pointed into the RIGHT direction, but the main idea is that it is a web dev framework. HTML, CSS, and JS are something you should definitely take a look at if that front-end will be your main focus, but still useful for back-end.

Here's the thing.. Asp.net includes.. Classic ASP.NET with web forms (please don't), ASP.NET MVC, and ASP.NET Web Api. It really depends on what you need to accomplish. I would say the latter 2 are probably most relevant, but they all still run on top of what is ASP.NET. 

There are some thorough tutorials on Microsoft Virtual Academy of MVC and I think web Api.

Thank you for your reply!";;
"Yeah sorry. You're right, I should have. CSS is difficult to get good at, and isn't nearly so closely related to ASP.NET. You will use CSS, I'll bet, but most of it will be in a whole different file. 

CSS is a good skill, but I'll bet it's not a major selling point for the job unless they say it is, so if you're pinched for time, I think you're better off studying ASP.NET directly.

HTML, on the other hand, is much more closely related to ASP.NET, and I think is a pre-req for understanding how ASP.NET works. 

I wish I could give better advice on resources, but I didn't have much luck in that department, either.";;
"Thanks a lot!

After that final advice I think I'll go with a quick revision over the HTML with the MVA videos (I used to play with that) and than move on with [the courses on the Pluralsight](http://blog.pluralsight.com/learning-path-web-application-development-with-asp-net-mvc5) (or at the very least, first few of them).

"I'm a little out of my depth there; I don't know much JS, and I don't know the position you're interviewing for, but if I *had* to guess, I'd say it sounds like you're still better served studying ASP.NET.

"Did you ever have a project in school where the teacher broke the class into groups and assigned you each a topic and told you you were going  to ""teach the class?""  you probably barely listened to the other groups' lessons and the rest of your class barely listened to your's,  but you knew your topic inside and out.  You researched it in depth and anticipated what questions your classmates and teacher would ask and you researched answers to those questions.  That's basically the same thing here.  Even if no one reads your blog,  expect that some kiss ass teachers pet is going to real every damn word of it and call you out on any mistakes in front of the whole class so it better be buttoned up.

1. Make rules more clear. Are links to individual blog posts allowed? Is it ok to post links to your own blogs/blogposts(i.e. self-promotion)? Is it ok to submit links to other people's blogs?
2. Make several submissions to your sub! Find a few interesting blogs and submit links to them. I guess people will be more willing to subscribe to a non-empty sub. most submissions to /r/ConTalks are made by a single person(the top mod) and the sub looks great anyway.
3. Make a top post meaningful. You should probably outline the ideas you have for your sub.
4. The sub is new, so I think you should submit it to subs like /rewreddits and the like to gain a much-need first few dozens of subscribers. 
5. Submitting a link to /r/programming and /r/coding won't hurt
6. If you have ideas for community events, that's great. First, it helps your community. Second, you can repost them to relevant subs(e.g. this one), so other people can join. ";;

An xor operation takes 2 binary strings and conducts an XOR operation on them, kind of like a plus or minus. See the examples in the wiki, but read up on xor somewhere else, the wiki is not for a beginner. 

The operation is done in binary, even though the site presents the values in hexadecimal. 

Here's a quick way to do it in python. 

    print hex(0x1c0111001f010100061a024b53535009181c ^ 0x686974207468652062756c6c277320657965)

Couple questions regarding your use of hex()

1. aren't the values you're passing already in hex? why would you have to call hex() on them then?
1. I must have been being confused by them saying 'after hex decoding', because you didn't do that did you? ";;
"1.The 0x specifies that the number is in base 16, it's still a literal number. Try   

    print 0xA

You call hex() because the return value is a decimal number, which you must convert into hex. 

2.I'm not sure what you mean, but all of the arithmetic is done in binary. ";;
Okay thank you!;;
"It depends on what *other* type(s) of development you want to do.

Going from making web sites to developing firmware for embedded systems isn't going to happen overnight, for example.";;
Of course :p I mean more of going from a web developer to say iOS, Android, C# for desktop apps or something. ;;
"If you are good at web development, chances are you can learn to do many other types of software development, but it's all different and takes time and practice like anything else.

I like to dabble in creating all different types of programs, personally, so I have a good understanding of a lot of the differences between web development and, say, iOS development, or game development.

I wouldn't call myself an ""any kind of developer"", but I feel that I'm pretty dynamic in that area. There are still lots of areas where my knowledge is extremely limited, though.";;
"I get what you mean. I find it hard to believe that anyone is really a master at any one particular thing because it seems like there are so many factors to consider and that it would be limiting to just focus on one thing.

"> I figured it was typical to be able to pick something else up with relative ease but wondered how others with more knowledge felt about it.

It's often easier to learn a second language than it was to learn the first. But that has a lot to do with understanding when and how to use conditions, loops, etc., since most languages have these shared logical constructs.

After learning a few languages, however, it can sometimes be difficult to remember the quirks and specific behavior of each. For example, passing arguments by reference to a function is a something that works a bit differently in different languages, so that's something that can easily trip me up if I switch back to language B after only using language A for a few weeks.";;
"Yeah that's even something that I've noticed only knowing javascript + learning ruby; every once and awhile I catch myself trying to do things the javascript way instead of the ruby way.

"In general, your analysis is spot on.

> If anyone's reading this and learning along and is confused about the two sets of parentheses, let me hypothesize about that. The DragDropContext() function that's defined further up by another require() statement itself returns a function. So that's why you can call one, pass it that HTML5Backend variable, and then it returns another function that you can call right away with the Application variable. (Please, please, please tell me if I'm wrong.)

Correct.

> So I'm guessing module.exports getting the return value of the DragDropContext() is the actual value that's being passed back up above to our App variable:   

>       var App = require('./components/Application')?

Depending on how you you interpret this, yes. `DragDropContext` is a function, you execute it, it returns a function, you execute *that* function with the second set of parens, and that second return value is what `App` receives.";;

">  It's at this point, I'm lost. I tried following into the react-dnd[9] module that was being include with Webpack, but there's a ton of advanced ECMAScript6 (aka ECMAScript 2015) and ECMAScript7 being used which I don't really know anything about yet.

What *exactly* are you wondering about? What do you want explained?";;
"At the point that you quoted, I started getting tired and distracted.  I started to lose my train of thought and was exploring the in the wrong direction.  I should have stayed within the example code instead of exploring outside of it into external dependencies.

I was reading up on the react-dnd module's source and there was some stuff in there, like invariants, classes, among other things.

For instance, the main file that was used in the above example from react-dnd was DragDropContext.js.  Inside there is [this function here.](https://github.com/gaearon/react-dnd/blob/master/src/DragDropContext.js#L6)  An exported default function returns another function which takes an argument that shares its context with a returned inner class that sets a scoped variable to a copy of the argument but makes it static.

You can kinda follow the returns down the line in that instance, but there are keywords used, like `export`, `default`, `const`, `static`, and `class` that aren't quite available universally, yet.  I understand some of those keywords because I'm familiar with Java and C++ among a couple of other languages, but don't know how they're different in JavaScript and didn't have the time to look them up and read about them.  

And that's where I got stuck because I started looking up what React itself actually used, read about the transpiler, and then just kinda fizzled out and gave up.  I just need some time to look back over things and write some questions and other thoughts.  I might just start a website and blog about it.";;
Just know, that this is unrelated from react itself.;;
"I didn't have to read your whole post to see that you understand how complex and overwhelming development in JavaScript can be.

If you don't find your way through it with the help of others here, I'd be happy to start from scratch with you on a very small React project and show you how I do it. My development process is very simple and intuitive, but dynamic enough to accommodate most JavaScript projects.

"It's wild, man.  I've done some development in C++ and although it can get a little interesting with pointers and some certain language specific semantics, it's relatively straightforward in how things are usually handled.

With JavaScript, they really could adopt Perl's mantra, TMTOWTDI.  There are a million different tools, libraries, frameworks and methodologies.

What's worse is that most of these disappear and are forgotten as quickly as they appeared.

Which libraries should you implement? Which frameworks should you take the time to learn? Is it stupid to create a large-scale application in AngularJS 1.x today? Will React be around in a year, and is it worth having your entire team learn it? What should your development tools consist of? How should you be handling dependencies? Should you be using Gulp / Browserify / NPM? Is anyone still using RequireJS?

There are as many answers to these questions as there are people to give them. I stopped trying to figure out who to listen to and just started learning the tools that I found to be the most useful *today*.

Regarding the 3th and 5th questions:

3. But why is it not required?

5. What is the difference between writing %s or %d and writing the variable? ";;
"> But why is it not required?

`python foo.py` starts execution at the top of the file, progressing down line by line. In contrast, a C/C++ program starts execution at the `main` symbol.";;
"1. Why do you think it should be?
2. [You get a lot of formatting flexibility with the string formatting operations.](https://docs.python.org/2/library/stdtypes.html#string-formatting)
";;
"1. Say you have a variable `yes = 5`, and you do `print yes`, should you get ""yes"" or ""5""?  In Python, you get ""5"", in order to avoid ambiguities (ambiguities are considered bad in Python).  To be more technical, `yes` is a variable name, `""yes""` or `'yes'` is a string literal.  `print` prints variables or literals.  So `print ""yes""` is like `a=""yes"";print a` (without defining the `a` variable, of course).  Python doesn't distinguish between `""` and `'` for string literals, so you can do things like `""You'd think that""` and `'They said ""WHAT!?""'`.
2. There are, but they are optional.  Lines end at the end of a line.  You can put a semicolon at the end of a line, it is valid syntax, and can also use semicolons to put two lines together.  But don't do either of these, it is ugly.
3. It doesn't need one.  Python puts no special weight on any particular function.  You can have a function called `main`, but it isn't treated in any special way.
4. There are many performance optimizations that cannot be done in Python because of its flexibility.
5. Have you tried `print ""I like ice-cream with "", flavour`?  It works fine as long as the variable `flavour` is defined.  You can also concatenate strings with `+`, so something like `flavour='vanilla';mystr = ""I love ice-cream with "" + flavour;print mystr` (note that I mixed and matched `""` and `''`, as I said Python does not distinguish between the two).
6. There were a lot of syntax changes with the update to Python 3.  For the most part syntax changes within Python 2 and within Python 3 are backwards-compatible, although functions can change.
7. You can use any text editor.  On windows, `notepad++` has some nice features like syntax highlighting, but `.py` files are just plain text files, so any program that can work with plain text files will work.";;
"> Why are there no semicolons?

Because there is no immediate need for them? A reason for Pythons popularity is the cleanliness of the syntax.


> Where is the main function?

Where you `def` it to be ;)

> Why people call Python slow?

Because it is significantly slower in terms of processing than, for example, C++. If you do low-scale work, it likely won't affect you, especially if you're a beginner. But once you do more complex stuff, it can be a hindrance - but sometimes, a manageable one. ";;

The 'mms' uri can be used for video (for example, mms://space.cowboy/video.mkv), although that is technically specifically for Windows Media Player. I'm not aware of a generic 'open this with any video player' URI, probably because people usually just embed videos in the web page.

"First of all you need to be more specific when saying ""Visual Basic"" - that name refers to two similar but very different languages:

Visual Basic 6  (or VB6) - which was last updated 17 years ago (!!!!). It was a bad language by those days standards and it's beyond a dinosaur now.

Visual Basic .NET (VB.NET) - which is a somewhat modern language . I really hope your school is teaching this over the other one. If that's so, you might have more luck fighting good tutorials by googling ""visual basic .net"" or ""vb.net"" over just ""visual basic"".

Good luck.";;
Thanks for the response, yeah I meant the newer one (.NET) why would people still use the older language? doesn't the newer/updated language have the same syntax as the older one? ;;
"They have similar syntax but work very differently. As to why people would still use older languages:

* Some schools haven't updated their curriculum in decades and are still teaching older languages

* There are big projects written in older languages. Sometimes so big that the cost of rewriting them in a newer one is prohibitively higher than hiring people to maintain the old code

* Force of habit - if you worked in one language for years, you might be a person who wants to just continue working in that language

And probably more than I can think of right now.";;

"What exactly does it do wrong? Is it the fact that it never prints the changed string?
";;
Yes, my bad should've been more clear. It just outputs what the user inputs.;;
"Right, because it simply never prints the changed string. As in, there is no code in the program to print the changed string. :P

Ok so I put cout << in front of the tweet.replace on the bottom line and still the same thing.;;
"How strange; it works when I do that. Can you show me the changed code, plus example input and output?

it outputs the meaning of LOL under the tweet but doesn't replace it inside the tweet.";;

	if (positionOfLOL != string::npos) {

    Please god work LOL

"What does ""in front of the tweet.replace"" mean exactly?  Are you printing the value before making the replacement?  Why would you do that?  It's not going to show the results of making the replacement unless you print the value after the replacement has been made.

I thought if I output what the change was it would work. I'm sure this isn't that hard.;;
"I don't understand.  I already showed an example invocation of your program with a few minor modifications working properly.  Can you not reproduce that output with that program?

I removed `tweet.resize(160)`.  That's going to pad out the length of the string with nulls if the length was less than 160.  You almost certainly don't want that.  And you are using the wrong type for the return value of `tweet.find()`, which generates a warning.  Use `size_t` or better, `auto`.
";;
That's actually half the assignment to keep the 160 resize. It also runs with no syntax errors.;;
"You only want to call `tweet.resize(160)` if the length is greater than 160.  Calling it when the length is less than 160 appends a bunch of null characters, and unlike C strings, C++ strings are *not* null-terminated, which means your program is going to be outputting a bunch of nulls.  They're non-printing characters, so you probably didn't notice, but your program is still wrong.  Example:

    $ cat foo.cpp 
    #include <string>
    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
        std::string str = ""abc"";
        
        str.resize(10);
        std::cout << str;
    }

    $ g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++14 -g -O2 -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG foo.cpp

    $ ./a.out | od -Ax -tx1z
    000000 61 62 63 00 00 00 00 00 00 00                    >abc.......<
    00000a

See those extra nulls?  They should not be there.  You're not doing the assignment properly if you have `tweet.resize(160)` unconditionally.

> It also runs with no syntax errors.

That doesn't mean there's nothing wrong, it just means you aren't using your tools properly and/or your tools don't warn about this particular problem.

Alright I fixed it. I didn't realize that I put the cout << tweet << endl; before the bracket. Thanks for making me realize that hahaha.;
"As /u/Updatebjarni pointed out, it's on the discouraged resources list. The way his videos are structured (and this goes for videos besides C++ as well), he just shows you syntax. He doesn't teach you about the programming concepts behind them and why they are important. 

For list(s) of resources on [C++](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq_cpp), check out the FAQ. The general consensus is that most online teaching sources for C++ are bad, mostly because they teach in a C style or don't teach modern C++, and that it is best to get a good book (recommendations in the FAQ).";;

"Ask them. If you have to ask, though...

At most organizations you'd have to ask IT about this, though, not your boss. (Or ask IT through your boss.)";;
"Depends on the employer. Some are cool with it, some aren't.

In any case, this is probably something that you should be asking your IT department, not us. Whether or not you can install those kinds of programs is typically a matter of company policy. 

It would also probably be a good idea to ask your boss if he's ok with you learning programming in your spare time to begin with. (And if he is, then it's easy to follow-up by asking if it's ok to install the tools you need to learn programming). If IT also clears it, you should be good.

Security risks: there's always going to be some risk when downloading something from the internet, but Netbeans and Sublime Text should be fine. 

The main thing I would watch out for is legal risks.

Given that you're still learning, this is unlikely to be an issue anytime soon, but I would make sure to read up on [open source licenses](http://opensource.org/licenses), especially if you're planning on releasing a commercial program at any time. You shouldn't run into any issues with most editors and IDEs, but if you ever download and use any library which is licensed under a [copyleft](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.en.html) license such as the [GPL](http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license), and decide to distribute your program as a product that the public will use, you are then legally obliged to also release the source code for your entire program (which is a problem if you wanted to keep your code proprietary).

For example, my employer does not let us use R Studio or MongoDB at all because they find their licensing terms too draconian + find that it's not worth the hassle trying to comply with them.

If all you're interested in is just learning programming + using those libraries for personal or internal use, then I don't really think you have anything to worry about, but the moment you start using your programming skills as a part of your job, you should probably go and educate yourself. (standard disclaimer: I'm not a lawyer)";;
"There's nothing explicitly against it. My company is a small outfit and our computer system has been compromised in the past because one of the managers wouldn't stop looking at porn. I just wouldn't want anyone to be overly suspicious or accusatory, against me like, ""burn the witch!"" because they fail to understand what I'm doing. On the one hand, the company won't hesitate to promote anyone with computer skills. On the other, many coworkers and those in charge are mostly tech-illiterate.";;
Just do it and explain what it is they aren't going to fire you. They might pay for your license like mine did (and I'm in management consulting, not even programming);;
Usually the only reason we care is because we have to run the EULA through the legal team. It's often just a procedural thing, but it does make a difference. Personally, I don't care what text editor / diff tool / whatever people use - I just care that we've covered the user by getting legal approval on the EULA. ;;
"Depends.  At work, our current policy is ""don't be stupid"" although we work with sensitive data so I wouldn't be surprised if the policy gets changed in the future.

Engineers typically do need to be able to install programs as part of their jobs though, so any process in place needs to allow this to happen efficiently and without red tape.

You should expect that the IT department can probe any employee's computer, and for instance, determine which programs are installed at any time.  Although it's debatable whether this is a violation of privacy, IT departments are required to ensure that the work network is free of viruses and therefore typically need to monitor some things on employee computers.";;
What about Notepad++? I'd like to be able to use the cpu for writing my own programs and have been shifting between using an IDE at home and just Notepad or web based stuff at work.

"Again, it depends.  You should ask whoever is responsible for these things at work.

For the record, at many companies (especially larger companies or companies that work with confidential information), you can't transfer files to/from a work computer.  i.e. there's a very clear wall between work resources and personal resources.

At work, our IT department gets a notification any time an employee plugs in a USB device, and if the USB device happens to be a storage device (e.g. flash drive or external hard drive), the poor soul gets a personal visit from IT's Senior Vice President.";;
"I work for a somewhat small manufacturing company that actively promotes computer use(to nullify boredom, I guess). The owner has a great deal of interest in companies such as Github and we make products for them. I work third shift and don't come across anyone from IT on the reg, but my guess is that, if they knew what I were up to, I might even be promoted. I just wouldn't want any less ""computer-literate"" associates making baseless accusations. Edit: The reason being that, while I know the boss is a ""hip"" young entrepreneur-type, he's not a developer, per se. So, he could easily be mislead if some person were to say, ""Aww geez! the computer's down! Must be that guy who put Notepad++ on here... Not me, going on random websites, unthinkingly...""";;
If they will let you use an external drive you could set one up with that and boot off it for when you want to program and then reboot back into local drive for work stuff;;
"You could just make it `'orderby'=> ""RAND($rand)""`.

There's an issue with your logic though due to what `date(""g"")` does: 
> g - 12-hour format of an hour without leading zeros - 1 through 12

This means $rand can only obtain 12 different values and so can your random query to the MySQL database when using 12 different values as a seed. What you should do instead is to use a function which constantly keeps changing, once an hour.

You can base it off the UNIX timestamp `time()` which is in seconds. For an interger count in hours you could just do: `$rand = floor(time() / (60 * 60))` where `60 * 60` is the amount of seconds in an hour and `floor` is used to round the result.";;
"Thanks @sim642. But `'orderby'=> ""RAND($rand)""` not working on WordPress. WordPress only recognize `'orderby' => 'rand'`.";;
"Now looking at what you're actually trying to do in SQL. How is it even supposed to work? I don't think you can `ORDER BY` an integer.

What you should do instead is return all the rows and then in PHP use random with the hourly seed to get the single row out.";;
"Codecademy alone is NOT enough. It is a very good start, but it holds your hand too much. 

I did the HTML/CSS course yesterday, and did my first personal project. http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css

It is simply recreating google.com. When you get down to it, it is much tougher than the Codecademy tutorial. I managed the whole tutorial in less than 5 hours, and took around 7 hours to complete that task as perfect as possible. 

Just like all programming, practice is best. Codecademy gives you a good view of the syntax and basic workings of the language. 

EDIT: Here is my GitHub page for the above project. https://github.comikmic94/Building-google.com.mt It is NOT perfect, and it has a lot of mistakes and/or deviations from standards, but it is the first piece of HTML/CSS code I did with no hand holding (I needed to google stuff, obviously, but nobody gave me a step by step guide what to do, like Codecademy). The Odin Project is quite good (I'm doing it now). As stated, it holds your hand much less, but it is less practice based. It gives you a TON of information, then gives you one longer project. Quite useful imo. Feel free to message me if you need any help from a beginner who is facing the same struggles like you :)";;
You should think of CodeCademy as an appetizer. It gives you a taste of what programming is like + eases you into it, but you should really supplement it with a heftier main course. (our FAQ contains links to additional resources you might want to try checking out).;;
"Well the HTML and CSS courses are pretty complete if you want to work as web developer (the programmer) and not pursuing for web UI designer or ""the CSS guy"" career.

I haven't personally done any HTML/CSS tutorials after Codecademy and I do fine. Of course I have to google a lot like ""how to make a drop down in HTML"" but nothing much really.

Javascript. Not enough by any means. Do some projects of your own for practice or use the odin project and also learn how the most common libraries and frameworks like JQuery, AngularJS, Bootstrap and NodeJS (server side) work.";;
Codecadamy is not there to prepare you for a working environment. It simply teaches you the basics of a particular language. This is usually not enough to survive in a work environment. You will get better by practicing;;
"It's good to get you the basics and hold your hand while diving into what is a very intimidating subject at first, but that's all it should be.

"This question gets asked here every. single. week.

"How familiar are you with a unit test? 

A unit test simply calls a module, and tests the output of the module against an expected result, given the same input. In small, bite size pieces. 

Let's say I have function foo(input). Given foo(""hello""), I expect foo to return ""hello world."" 

 So my unit tests for this in Jasmine looks like: 
    
        var myFooModule = require(""../lib/foo.js"")
        describe(""Foo Tests"", function() {
    
      it(""appends hello to given input"", function() {
        var expectedResult = ""hello world"";
        var result = myFooModule.foo(""hello"");
        expect(result).toBe(expectedResult);
      });
    });

Given this unit test, if my foo function appends "" world"" to hello, the test passes. If I were to work backwards from this test, I could reason that myFooModule, when called, should append world to the string.

So I'd make a module called ""foo.js"", and give it a function which, when called with a string, appends "" world"". Pretty simple stuff! 

Things like mocks and spies, are a little more complex. But essentially, they do what they describe. A spy ensures that when a function within a module is called, it's called given a specific set of arguements. For instance, if my fooModule internally called a function bar, and bar should be passed the input of foo, my spy would simply check what bar was called with, and whether it was equal to what was expected. 

Unit tests are pretty simple, but I'd be glad to point out more resources if you're still struggling. ";;

Thanks for your input!";;

"Sublime text is a pretty good text editor, and useful for writing things in all those languages. You can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as their respective file formats, and then open the HTML file with your browser to view the output.

"Don't use textedit on the mac.  It doesn't work like you think it should when you 'save as HTML.' You can get it to work but it's a lot easier to just download a good text editor.

It's also available on the other major OSs, so you can easily use the same tool on every machine with any language.

Once you're comfy, use the Emmet extension to turbocharge your HTML development.  I can build the foundation of a standard page in literally seconds with this tool.

Personally I also like the very old-school editors like VIM, (which is already on your mac) but that's very much an acquired taste. Try vimtutor from the terminal to learn about it.  It's very different from the editors you might know, but when you learn it, it will open up your brain.";;
VIM? I mean maybe if ~~he's~~ they are trying to make a quick edit to their bash_profile or to make a super small change to a file but I would hardly recommend VIM to a complete beginner. It's something definitely useful to know but I would stick that way down on the priority list. ;;

For example: copy the following into a file that ends in .html, and then right click the file and tell it open with browser.

<html><body> Hi, /u/Jatgoggin!!! </body><html>


Your browser understands how to read the HTML codes. Similarly, CSS is just styling. It is stuff that you can set inside html tags, but most people extract it to separate files that are loaded by a webserver.

So you could do <html><body><font color='red'>hi again!!!</font></body></html>

    </body>
    </html>

CSS has a lot more going for it than that, though. You can define a color for all paragraphs, for example, or define several different things on a page that share the same style. You can also change fonts, background colors, underline and bold, and many other things.  WIth the latest features in CSS, you can even animate!

No special tools are needed, just a good text editor.

My point is the HTML5 way here (which still isn't the best way, of course) is probably going to be better for a beginner than using the font tag, which has been deprecated since XHTML.  

It's always tricky to know how much information to give a beginner, so I see what you were doing there.  That's why I still went for an inline example, though there are much better solutions out there.

No, I understand your response. I thought about trying to go more indepth, but it's just such an enormous question that it's hard to actually write a good reply to it.;;
Honestly I would ditch the software at least for the first bit and get your feet wet with [CodePen](http://codepen.io/). From there you can write all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery you want. There is also [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/) that allows you to easily pull in third party libraries like JQuery. After playing around there and picking up a couple intro books I would graduate to something like the [Sublime Text Editor](http://www.sublimetext.com), get your feet wet with github and maybe deploy your first small project to a cloud based PaaS like [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com). There is also [Brackets](http://brackets.io/), it has more features than Sublime but might have a slightly higher learning curve. ;;
"`<header>` is for when the header is in the system header directories. `""header""` is for when it is in the same directory as the current file or in a directory specified relative to it.

As for the undefined reference, it isn't enough that you tell the compiler what type a function is by declaring it, you have to actually provide that function to the linker when you link the program. What is the command(s) you are using to build your program?
";;
"Thanks for the help, I thought I tried `""header""` before but I must have made a mistake or something.

How do I provide the function to the linker? When I compile my program I just write `g++ -o 2Amain 2Amain.cpp`. What else do I need to do to make sure the compiler sees the external function? Also, do I need to do anything specific for the file the function is in? Right now it's just a copy of the function in a .cpp file with the same name and the necessary headers.";;
"If it's a small project, with just a couple of source files, the simplest thing to do is to just build all of them with one command like so:

    g++ -o name file1.cpp file2.cpp file3.cpp

If the missing function is in a library, you tell g++ to include that library in the linking step like this:

    g++ -o name file1.cpp -lname_of_library

Some explanation of how it works: g++ is a sort of frontend (they call it a ""driver"") which invokes the compiler for each source file to produce object files and then invokes the linker to link all of the object files (plus libraries) together into an executable. The object files are compiled machine code files like the executable, but any references the code in a file makes to functions and variables (""symbols"" in linker parlance) defined in other source files are just compiled as placeholders. Such placeholders are called ""undefined references"". The linker must resolve them by looking the names up across the object files and/or libraries as it combines them together, filling in proper references instead of the placeholders.

Anyway, for bigger projects you would write a makefile which compiles each source file separately without linking, with commands like

    g++ -c -o file1.o file1.cpp

and then links them all together with something like

    g++ -o name file1.o file2.o file3.o
";;
Got it working, thank you so much for the help.;;
"> Right now it's just a copy of the function in a .cpp file with the same name and the necessary headers.

The compiler isn't going to magically compile that file and the linker isn't going to magically know to link with the resulting object file.  You have to do all of those things yourself.

For example, if you had `main.cpp` and `func.cpp`, then you could either compile them one at a time and then link explicitly:

    g++ -c main.cpp
    g++ -c func.cpp
    g++ main.o func.o -o executable

Or you can do all of those at once:

    g++ main.cpp func.cpp -o executable

The advantage of the former over the latter is that you don't have to recompile everything, only the units that need to be rebuilt.

Also, if these are really the commands you are using, you should have a look at the gcc manual.  The defaults are pretty horrid.  I recommend a set of flags along the lines of

    g++ -Wall -Wextra -pedantic -std=c++14 -g -O2 -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG ...

This turns on all sensible warnings, disables non-standard GNU language extensions, selects C++14 mode (this may need to be specified as `-std=c++1y` depending on the version of gcc you're using), enables debug information and optimization, and uses the debug version of the C++ standard library.  You can omit `-g` and `-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG` for a release build.

"I'm a moderator of /r/futurology. We're currently debating whether we should go private or not. My point was that we, unlike /r/learnprogramming, /r/suicidewatch, /r/depression, etc, do not offer a real service to our users that will be missed if we blacked out for a day or two. As such, I and many other mods are debating for blacking out.

This subreddit is different though. It's necessary for many people, provides a real service, and if it's blacked out on the wrong day, someone may fail a test, fail to meet a deadline, etc. I support /r/learnprogramming staying open.";;
"I think subreddits are going private not on the basis of whether or not they are a service, but whether or not they have the ability to do significant damage to Reddit in this protest.

/r/learnprogramming not so much, but /r/Futurology with so many subscribers could.";;
I was just expressing that subreddits that users literally rely on for career, life, or mental health reasons should probably all stay open. Default subreddits that no one will truly be hurt if they go dark... Well, that's a different story. I believe this subreddit falls into the former, and I am glad it is staying open because some people truly need it. ;;
They could ban all new posts and redirect users to a different service ;;
As vital as reddit's health is to /r/learnprogramming, blacking out /r/learnprogramming would be like fully blacking out StackExchange to protest SOPA. It would be with honest intentions, but would seriously not be worth it. We unfortunately need to leave this to the other subreddits.;;
"Well, in order for the protests to work you do need to use some drastic measures to bring the people out of the comfort zone and show them the dark side of the reality where their ""we don't care"" attitude allows for some very repressive initiatives to be passed.

I'm saying it as a citizen of a country in which a SOPA-like initiative was passed, mainly because most people didn't care enough to actively protest, and the big IT companies were too afraid for their revenues to do something unpopular but definitely non-ignorable.";;
Pretty sure Wikipedia went black for sopa/pipa ;;
"> significant damage to Reddit in this protest.

Making subreddit private makes harm only to its users.

Yes, Reddit is nothing without users, but mods are hurting exactly the same community they allegedly care about.";;
And add revenue, but sure. ;;
"While /r/learnprogramming is a fantastic resource and subreddit, people who need help to "" pass a test, meet a deadline, etc"" during an outage can always just go ask their question on StackOverflow where they are pretty much guaranteed a quality answer.";;
Of course you shouldn't. Really disappointing you'd even consider this protest worth a damn. Bunch of babies. ;;
Going private makes no sense to me. its censorship. ;;
How is that censorship? They aren't going private with the intent of restricting people from speaking their opinion, they're doing it to protest and get the Reddit teams attention to an issue. That's not censorship:;;
But they are severely restricting people from speaking. I wish to speak by continuing to use the site as I did and I cannot do that.  I don't particularly care that Victoria was fired or why. If the mods don't like it they can stop being mods.  There is a button they can push in the mod panel that will let them do that. That way they can register their complaint and others are not forced to participate in their protest if they chose not to.;;
"But those parts of the site don't function without the mod teams. If all the mods quit then you can't use the site as you did. Either way this site is in trouble, and it won't be the same ever again, blame the admins for being bad at their job.

Also, on website censorship, only the government has a duty to protect your speech. As a private website you have no right to comment here. It's just a pet peeve, but websites have no duty (nor incentive, nor social obligation) to allow you to say anything you want whenever you want. Websites that provide that are a niche market. 

Websites people tend to like require moderators and some censorship (although this isn't really censorship in this case) to function. It's unfortunate but, it's how the world works, however much you seem to be under the illusion that websites have an obligation to your speech, or that they run themselves, it won't change that fact.";;
I didn't say anything about them doing anything illegal or unconstitutional, just that it was censorship, which is something that you yourself said private websites do. So your entire post is irrelevant and misplaced   ;;
Then how are they restricting your speech? You said they are restricting your speech, a private company cannot restrict your speech via censorship on their platform because they are the ones granting it in the first place. So the only thing left is constitutionality or legality.;;
"I will quote an expert on censorship and private corporations

"Since we are quoting ourselves:

This is more like going on strike.;;
It would be a strike if the users of those subreddits wouldn't use the subreddit. Now it is just a small elite forcing everyone to gtfo.;;
Do you mean like when employees of a public transportation company go on strike?;;
"No, when, say, a couple of train passengers bar the doors so no-one can enter the train.
";;
If you don't see mods as people providing a service, your analogy makes sense indeed.;;
"I understand your point though. If you see the moderators not as users but as the service-""employees"" of a company, they can go on strike to pressure their ""bosses"". 

I suppose the situation with reddit is a bit odd in this regard. Then again, I think that, instead of misusing moderation powers and ""trying to change the system"", people who don't like the way reddit runs its business,  should leave. There are alternatives enough, and if there aren't any, we could start our own. In the end, if it isn't the service itself, Eternal September is reason enough to move on from time to time.";;
"If you're going to leave out of the blue, why not protest first? It's not especially more damaging, and may lead to getting what you want.

That said, I know almost nothing about Victoria, almost never spend time on celebrity AMAs (or whatever else she did), and don't really care about this whole issue. I'd rather the subs I do use stay open. But I can imagine the relevance, and I figure mods are doing what they feel is important for the larger reddit community they care about.";;
Exactly, which is why am going through and unsubscribing the subs that show up on my front page without at least some form of creative protest. Have fun everybody, wherever going the path of least resistance will get you.;;
Going on strike would be to stop using reddit or buying reddit gold.  This is disrupting the use of the site for others. It's much more like censorship. ;;
That would be a boycott. Not going on strike.;;
Perhaps. But a strike would be more like if the mods just stopped moderating rather than closing the subreddit. ;;
Unless you think of a subreddit as a subway or train whose mods are drivers (or traffic agents, whatever is the most similar), as I replied to someone else. Of course analogies are weak in any case, since reddit is its own thing. But definitions still stand.;;
"I'm not a moderator in this subreddit, so I feel like it's okay for me to respond to that comment with ""Lol."" :) If you think that listening to users and obeying the will of the community is censorship, then you have some strange ideas hah.";;
it's not really the will of the community.  It's the will of the mods. If I wish to post to a given subreddit and I can't, that's not my will being obeyed or listened to is it?;;
If the majority of our users make it clear they want to blackout then we would be wrong to not listen. Your opinion is unimportant. It is the community that decides, not you.;;
How can you say the community decides and then say a member of said community is unimportant? He is arguing his point just like the rest of the community. Somebody needs to learn the definition of contradiction and double standards. ;;
"I already explained this. The community decides, meaning that 51% of the community is the deciding factor. Those 49% are allowed to voice their opinions, obviously, but if they're in the minority then they must accept that their position is the less popular of the two choices and accept the reality of the situation. Any individual is unimportant. It is the consensus of the majority that is important.

Do you get this upset when we vote for elections? This is how the world works.";;
Just because a person doesn't agree with the majority doesn't make them unimportant, besides this guy seems to agree with the mods decision, to not go private and get involved in these silly protest over shit that doesn't matter in the long run. It's a company's own business who they hire and fire, not the customers. ;;
">It's a company's own business who they hire and fire, not the customers.

It's a waste of time to discuss this if you think that is the reason behind the blackout. You need to read more about the topic before you make silly assumptions like that.";;
I read it.  You people are pissing yourselves over something that is none of your business. The employees of reddit can fire who they want if you liked them to bad. ;;
"If the majority decides to blackout then all they have to do is not post or comment and the site will get the message.  But that's not what they did they forced participation on those who don't necessarily agree with.  That's just as arrogant and top down as what they are complaining about with the administration.

My opinion is unimportant.  Isn't that exactly what people are complaining about? that the administration of this site doesn't think the opinions are important enough to listen to?  You're a hypocrite.   ";;
This discussion is over, as the admins have already acknowledged our concerns and apologized. They did so because many default subreddits blacked out. Subreddit actions are decided by community support decided by majority comments and votes, not by you and what you want. We are a community, not simply a collection of individuals. Your suggestion is not how communities work. Please move on.;;
Hear hear. Education shouldn't be interrupted by politics.;;
Just think of all the CS homework that wouldn't get done if /r/learnprogramming went private.;;
+1. I come here a lot, I love helping people. I think it's best if smaller subreddits that have their own communities stay out of the reddit meta drama.;;
"Point is for all we know they can introduce paid mods and submitters who will recommend certain brands over others based on marketing. 

Sad to see we won't take a stand ";;
So the subreddit should forsake the people that it was created to help for the sake of politics that it will most likely not affect anyhow? ;;
"What makes you so sure about ""it will most likely not affect anyhow""? From what little i know about the situation, it seems that the reddit management is really concerned about the stand some of the prominent subreddits took. And they took it for a reason that has a potential to affect any user of any subreddit. So, while whether to join this movement or not is a decision for the whole community to make, one can hardly say that showing some solidarity is pointless.";;
"Are there any good forums for programming to check out that can be alternative resources for tutorial/recommended videos/guides and to discuss them?

I just want to know to explore other communities and just in case this subreddit does go down";;
Good call guys. This is an actually useful subreddit (unlike r/funny and other shitty defaults), so blocking it even for a short time would be bad for the people who visit it.;;
What's that over there? It's reddit on fire.;;
I appreciate this subreddit not going dark. It has become a vital resource for learning elements of my (hopefully) future career path. Even not for answers, I really like just reading about the thoughts and experiences or those who frequent this place. I don' visit any other subreddits aside from those in the sphere of programming so I feel that I've had an overall positive experience so far since starting to use reddit.;;
Will mods be doing anything in protest (e.g. something that doesn't disrupt the sub's usefulness)?;;
As of this writing, we have no plans to mount a protest in any way.  We'll be following the story closely and will update the community if anything changes.  Before anything happens, we'll get community input to ensure there are no surprises.  Our number one priority is preserving the LearnProgramming community and ensuring it can function as a useful tool for anyone interested in development.;;
What is the master plan should reddit die? Where shall we go? ;;
Reddit won't shut down overnight, there are too many people invested to let that happen.  If things continue to deteriorate, we'll come up with an approach then.  Right now we don't expect to need to go anywhere.;;
A lot of people went to voat.co but then it crashes because it can't handle so many new users at once. ;;
Good the last thing we should do is prevent ambitious programmers from learning the trade just to boycott a decision that is so far removed from the average Redditor;;
Definitely agree with the choice! While I agree that maybe some other subreddits can get away with going private, I personally believe that /r/learnprogramming is too valuable of a resource go that route. Good call moderators.;;
Thank you for keeping us in consideration. ;;
Good decision. An employee was fired. So what? I can't believe people take this thing so seriously.;;
"I agree with this. People on the Internet pull out their proverbial pitchforks at the drop of a hat. This is caused, in my opinion, by the over sensitivity that people have developed in the last ten years or so. I think it all boils down to people love drama, and before it wasn't as easy for people to spread their own personal drama as it is now. 10 years ago when I was just getting out of school, people could really only infect people they knew or people in their close geographic area. Now people can get on DramaBook and infect many more people that don't know them from Adam with their dramatic infections.

Its awesome that we can connect to people all over the world for support, entertainment, or business, but most of the Internet seems to be some drama or another. And usually it is something that is either none of anyone's business or something that has to be so far inflated so that it looks like an issue of importance. I love computers and the Internet but the world seemed such a simpler place and not so full of unimportant drama. ";;
"Today they fire an employee who was in charge of being the crucial middleman between the management and the community. And, by firing that person, they hurt some people and crippled their working process without a backup plan.
You swallow it today - and tomorrow it's gonna be reddit selling out big time and showing you promoted materials on the main page instead of the top-rated user-submitted content. Will you be as tolerant then as you are now?

I'm saying this because a lot of you guys seem to forget what happens when the society doesn't give a proper feedback to the authorities that govern it. In Britain, a minister who was caught spending 10k pounds from the government funding on his gardener resigned immediately. In Russia the minister was caught in a corruption scandal about hundreds of millions of dollars - and he was quietly amnestied and never even went to trial. Why? Because in Britain any party that would cover any sort of corruption in its ranks would flop on the next elections, and in Russia people generally don't give a damn, so they can be manhandled in any way the authorities desire.";;
"Thank you so much for this, and for letting people know, I actually didn't have a clue of what was going on. Thanks again!:D
";;
"Understandable, due to the help nature of the sub.

With that said, I would support shutting the sub down. Perhaps better to disable submissions, so that users can still access resources and thus won't be locked out of the links to resources they depend on. The specific help nature of the sub makes it quite valuable to shut down, IMO, since users being unable to get help would presumably direct their anger at the source of the problem (and raising attention seems to be a major goal of the protest).

Burn the library because your favorite librarian was fired? ;;
"Oh but will the library be actually burned? More like hidden away for a limited span of time. Nobody's suggesting to prune the subreddit's history. So once this is all settled, things can get back to normal.

This is the point of any protest. When people go out on the streets, they hinder the traffic and scare away customers from the nearby service providers. But this is a form of necessary evil to prevent something bigger from happening.";;
This sub should go dark. Support the community. We stand strong together;;
"Think of it like your local community: If shit hits the fan, there will be people who will support each other, and then there will be people who will look for their own good first, even if it contradicts the common good. It's the wide assumption each individual erroneously does: That the people he lives together share common beliefs and values with him. Essentially is ""my values trump your values"" kind of thing. Use a term like ""meta drama"" and everyone's disdain towards the fact a person of importance lost his job for reasons unexplained will be spontaneously visible: After all, who likes such a negative thing such as DRAMA?

I thought there were plans to do AMA's here but I suppose the person responsible for the arrangements is different. If it was the same person there would be pitchforks, regardless of what this sub ""stands for"". 

There's another comment who equates a subreddit that is about learning a skill like programming with a subreddit that is about stopping someone from killing himself. As someone who was suicidal and loves programming I refuse to agree that it's THAT impactful. 

Want the plot twist: If one day *knocks wood* a Reddit's decision happens to actually impact this sub negatively, we'll forget that we're standing for something and rally everyone to stand together. And they will. Because whether or not we would do the same for them matters not. What matters is what they think we would do.";;
"The moderators had planned to do a series of AMAs but weren't able to get everything in order in a reasonable time.  Regardless, even if we were directly impacted by the situation, this subreddit would stay open.  To go back to your ""local community"" analogy.  Even when things are going to shit, services that people rely on remain operating (emergency services, the power grid, the education system).  LearnProgramming is a fundamental tool used by many to continue learning.  We have no plans to discontinue that tool.";;
Support the community by imposing censorship?;;
That's not what censorship is.;;
Yes it is.  They are preventing millions of users from speaking by using the site as they wish in order to advance their own agendas. ;;

Is speech being suppressed by the subreddits going private.  Pretty obviously yes. If you want to post and you cannot then it's suppressed. 

Why is it being suppressed? to make a point to the administration. People carrying on as usual would be ""inconvenient"" to that goal.  

Who is it finding it inconvenient? The mods of the subreddits going dark who would qualify as a ""media outlet, authority or other groups or institutions.""

"I was going to make a snarky comment about the extreme and absurd hyperbole of comparing a private company making a series of decisions that drive some of their users away to the Holocaust. And I suppose I just have.

Through our dependence on private, corporate forums like Reddit, Facebook, Twitter, etc. we've ceded control of much of the discourse on the web to a relatively small cadre of individuals with their own, usually profit-oriented, motivations. Whatever you think of these individuals, that's a road to ruin. You have no right to free speech on these private forums (and, as a corollary, you can't be censored by them) and any appearance that you do is an illusion. You are there on sufferance alone, and the masters can be capricious and fickle.

That, a bit perversely, is why we need places like /r/learnprogramming. The only road to true free speech on the web is through self-empowerment. Learn to build your own web page, your own blog, your own public forum, your own Reddit clone, whatever. Find a cheap web host with a history of protecting its users' rights from governments and their courts, entities with real censorious power. Get to ranting.";;
I'm not comparing reddit to holocaust. I'm pointing that people tend to ignore what's going around them just because it doesn't affect them directly.;;
"In your snarkly attempt to blame the guy above in comparing something to the Holocaust based on a verse you saw, you missed the main point. Namely, that this verse is not about the Holocaust only. As you probably know, it's how the Jew genocide is called, and the Jews are mentioned in the fourth use-case out of five.

This verse is about something else. It's about the ""divide and conquer"" tactics that leads to the disastrous outcome, however small and insignificant the start could seem.

Your lack of personal investment and, therefore, a total indifference to the processes in question, is understandable. After all, it all happened in a different subreddit, far far away from you, so why should you bother.
But if you were an avid user of /r/IAmA, you'd take it much more personal, because what you now call ""a private company making a series decisions"" would be something else, it would be something that affects you personally.

Of course, if you don't really care about what happens to Reddit then you'll do fine in any case. But the reason behind the subreddits' revolt is that the termination of that employee allegedly was a result of a rift between what the Reddit management thinks of the community and what the community wants to be seen as. It was not just ""fire A, hire B"" case, it was a result of the fact that the management wants more monetization, more product endorsement, and that all this stuff must be accepted by the community and whoever doesn't like it is shown the door.

In terms of the verse, today they got the Communists. But you couldn't care less about the Commies, so you hardly have any emotions besides contempt towards those who feel offended. But if/when they come to your beloved /r/learnprogramming and change it so that it's the ads you see the most and not the on-topic content you like - what will you do? Hardly anything, because the momentum will already be lost, the Reddit community driven apart, and you would be offered to either submit to the new rules or go look for a better place. Which is never easy, since you would have to effectively start fresh.

Anyway, i'm not telling anyone to jump on the barricades, it must be a collective decision anyway. But such hatred towards those who feel affected by what's happening is really uncalled for.";;
"I wrote something longer, which I realize now isn't helpful. So the short version:

I don't hate anyone in this, I don't feel contempt for anyone in this. You're projecting.

I know what  /u/fazzah thought he was doing, I just think that he went about it all wrong. No matter what anyone thinks they're doing with that poem, it *is* about the Holocaust and should only be deployed in situations where there is a real threat to life and liberty. Drawing any sort of analogy between the Holocaust and Reddit is completely over the top and uncalled for.

> But if you were an avid user of /r/IAmA, you'd take it much more personal, because what you now call ""a private company making a series decisions"" would be something else, it would be something that affects you personally.

It would still be a private company making a series [of] decisions, and any deployment of a Holocaust poem would still be uncalled for. If Reddit starts arresting people, or even starts using the power of the courts to somehow bankrupt people or something, then yeah, start calling them pocket fascists.

Getting angry at a private company for trying to monetize something is like getting angry at a fox for eating your chickens. The longer we go along, the more I think we made a terrible mistake when we crawled out of the Usenet primordial ooze and onto the oh so corporate Web.";;
"Well, maybe you're right about me projecting something. Maybe it's not contempt that's driving you so deaf towards others' activism. Maybe it's just a genuine enjoyment of having no control over your own life.

Reddit may be a private company. But it's the common users like you or i that bring it money. The redditors may easily be considered the customers, the clients of the service that Reddit provides. And when the internal decisions start affecting the quality of said service, it's more than just for the clients to react.

Maybe you're just into that mindset like ""we're only guests here, so let's not demand anything and enjoy whatever we're given"". If that's genuinely your position then you're obviously entitled to it. But imagine any other service where you expect some particular quality to be delivered. From the local food joint to your ISP to some media streaming service like Netflix. Those services would definitely be provided by the private companies, and, according to your logic, whatever internal decisions they take you must be fine with it.
But if the food joint fired their chef, so now their meal is shit, the ISP fired their senior techsupport engineer, so now all your complains go straight to /devull, and the media streaming fired someone else so now some thing you relied upon is broken - will you just submit yourself to it and keep paying, or you'll be outraged, posting huge rants somewhere online, maybe even here on Reddit?

Because if you do think that every service quality decline is something you have no right to address because it's a result of some internal decisions and they are always justified - well, then you endorse some sort of an escapist life principle, i.e. that one should either get over everything that he's subjected to or run away somewhere else where (s)he thinks it's better for now. And this sequence of actions put on an infinite loop of running forever.

Someone else in this thread mentioned SOPA. It wasn't passed in US because the common people and the industry actively protested against it. They didn't wanna sit there and wait until it's in effect and starts making their lives worse, so that they start thinking where to emigrate. No, they liked the country they were living in, and although the way authorities work allows them to pass such decisions with no consultation with the people, the people felt an urge to step in and vocalize their opinion, which was ""we don't need SOPA and its kinds"". And the authorities had to oblige.
Without the mass protests, do you think Americans had as much online freedom as they still have now? Nope. And it didn't need to be any Holocaust-like activity to be considered too oppressive to tolerate. Why you can't see that your mindset helps Reddit pass their own local SOPAs is beyond me.";;
"You are wildly conflating things all over the place.

1. I was originally offended by what I saw as a fatuous comparison between Reddit's actions and the Holocaust.
2. I said, in essence, that we can't trust private companies.
3. I took no stand on anything that Reddit said or did. I didn't say people shouldn't (or should) protest. I only said something about the Holocaust poem. You're projecting and inventing stances I never took. Thinking that something shouldn't be compared to the Holocaust doesn't mean that I'm OK with it.
4. SOPA is a government action that has nothing to do with anything I said above. You're completely off the reservation.";;
People really need to stop fucking using this. Its disgraceful. No, a website firing an employee is not basically the holocaust. Drama queens.;;
Yeah if Reddit becomes unusable I'll just waste my time on a different site.;;
You clearly don't understand the point of this. Of course I'm not comparing reddit drama to holocaust. The quote criticizes the stance of ignoring what's going around you just because it doesn't touch you directly. This is self-centered and short-sighted.;;
You're right, Reddit going downhill is not, in any way, shape or form, even slightly related to the Holocaust and it's wrong to mention both in one sentence (same with all the Nazi derived insults going around constantly). But think about this: right now, the internet is the biggest independent information sharing platform, allowing users to consult and create ideas, news and knowledge instantaneously in any location. It's a tool which has the potential to help, instruct, empower (among other numerous advantages) but also to ruin, destroy, stalk and even kill. And it's now becoming, due to its rapidly growing user base and increasingly easier means of access, another marketing/political/simple non-original content tool. Reddit is one of the few massive social networks where relevant, quality content is still a primary concern (even if you come here for /r/funny, you might stay here for some niche interest of yours) and we must not give that up. The whole issue today isn't just about an employee who was fired, that's just the tip of the iceberg in a growing amount of complains the users and moderators - the community that makes this website - have had for some time. In fact, it's our chance to mobilize the entire website to send a clear message that without its users, Reddit is literally nothing. And why does it matter to you? Well, perhaps it doesn't. But where will you go if Reddit goes down? Where is there such a driven, interesting community online? If Reddit goes down, everyone loses. Not today or tomorrow, maybe a better website will show up and take its place. Or maybe it won't - we can't know for sure. What I do know is that we can't take the chance. So in a way, this quote seems fitting: even the worst tragedies start with a simple action, and ours is not caring when we do not understand or can't yet see the big picture. We must always stand up against what we believe to be wrong.;;

You should probably have an understanding what each of those technologies are. If you're looking specifically at .NET positions, you'll definitely want to understand the different facets of .NET, like WCF, WPF, XAML, MVC, Web API, etc.;;
To what extent does understanding go, at what level can you say you understand? I've been through a fat stack of books on .Net and friends. I get what each of those are, but I don't think I could create something impressive in each one of those technologies.;;
"Choose one thing to understand really well, well enough that you can easily do a small to medium-sized application using it and be able to hold an intelligent conversation about what it's used for, why it was made, some pros and cons about it. Then, for the rest of them, just watch a few videos about them so you can have an understanding of what they're for. So when you're asked about them in an interview, you can say ""Well I watched this video once, I know it does X and is good because of Y, but I've never used it in a project.""";;
Ah, I was thinking being able to write a medium sized project from each of those. I can write a medium .NET or WPF application with ease. Crap, the game a buddy and I have been working on in Unity is pushing 20k lines of our own code (I get that that's tiny compared to other applications, large for us though). I'm just not as intimately familiar with those technologies as I am with .Net.;;
Can you give a real example or two? Honestly curious, and context may help with an explanation ;;
The thing is that many of those technologies go together. You should at least know what they are and what they are used for. ;;
"From my experience, a lot of smaller companies are looking for an all-in-one developer but only want to spend the budget for a junior. 

Don't be intimidated! Just go for the interview, even if you don't know a language. They will have to compromise on a developer and there is a good chance you will be on their short list if you know at least 50% of those languages and frameworks.

It's also not a bad idea to do a little bit of research on some of the languages that you don't know. Just so you can at least say you've dabbled in them.

Django is a web framework for the Python programming language. Python is reasonably easy to learn. However, Django is rather large and is much more difficult to learn compared to another Python web framework called [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org). I think 6-9 months is a pretty reasonable timeline if you are consistent and hard working. ;;
Thanks for making that distinction. It seems Flask is a common recommendation and I'll definitely consider it on the short list of options. I think the most important thing for me is that it's as accessible as possible so I don't get frustrated/over whelmed and give up.;;
In that case, Flask is definitely one of the best frameworks you could go with. I used it when starting out, and it is the least confusing framework I've ever used. ;;
"> I already have decent css/html skills and through using builtwith.com it's looking as if I should start with Django next.

You have many different options -- Python + Django is one of them (and Python is a very nice language imo), but there's no inherent reason why Django is a better choice. You have the option of using pretty much any language + framework for your backend (Ruby + Ruby on Rails, Node.js, etc...)

Just about the only thing you're probably going to want to learn is JavaScript to supplement anything you do on the frontend.

> Would anyone be willing to provide additional advise/information? Am I correct in saying Django is the language I should focus on? 

Django is not a language -- it is a library within a language called Python. Python would be a good choice, though as noted above, is not the only one. 

For a task like this, you should be able to use pretty much any backend language + framework. (Though if you're going to go with Python, I would also recommend you try checking out Flask, as /u/coderjewel suggests. Django is more complex/heavyweight, and Flask is simpler + easier to use).

> I guess my main question is.. How hard is this? Is it feasible to think that I could go from beginner to having a close to equivalent site built within 6-9 months if consistent and concerted effort was put forth? Or am I way off in my goal setting?

It's hard to say how long this will take, but for what it's worth, I do think that this is a good project to try attempting now. It seems like the sort of project which you can start off really simply, then make modifications + add features over time as you learn more about programming, which is a good model to follow if you're a beginner.";;
"Awesome, thanks for the thorough reply.

So, pretty sure I'm leaning in the direction of Flask, Javascript, and php. Is there a specific order in which they should be learned? Perhaps an optimal order?

"> So, pretty sure I'm leaning in the direction of Flask, Javascript, and php. Is there a specific order in which they should be learned? Perhaps an optimal order? 

If you're going to use Flask, then you want to learn Python. Python and PHP are entirely different programming languages. While in the long term it would be useful to learn both (expanding your toolset is a good idea just on principle), in the short term it would be redundant to do both. Do either Python+Flask, or PHP+something else, not both.

There really isn't an optimal order: do either JS first, or Python first then Flask next (Don't jump straight to Flask without learning Python).

Yep, that's the idea -- project-based learning is a great way to learn for pretty much all the reasons you pointed out.

However, it's probably going to take you a while to pull your site together piece by piece -- just don't try and tackle the entire thing at once. Start with something tiny, and iterate, layering features on top, sort of like how an oyster builds up a pearl.

So you're saying that because I'm already decent with css/html then I can just learn Javascript and php and not need to learn an additional language? 

I was under the impression that I would need to learn Javascript and php in addition to a framework such as Flask?

I'm not saying you won't have to learn a new language. I'm saying rather than hop onto a framework (which would require learning a language anyway), rather learn something native and raw. Javascript is an extremely popular choice for logic based web programming. Python isn't sustainable if you are learning web based programming.;;

It says when IS is better, so that's probably just not the case here.  Are you running these tests for different sized sets of inputs, like 100, 10,000, and 1,000,000 elements?  That would show how the difference changes...;;
they have the same complexity, so not really, plus insertion sort does a lot more writing.;;
The sorting algorithms themselves have the same complexity, but the add/remove operations on the data structure itself in order to carry out the algorithm varies greatly.;;
"It likely has to do with what type of data structure you are sorting. Using an array is faster for searching, but the number of exchange operations required by insertion sort is hell for arrays as it has to shift a bunch of elements on each insertion.

Using a linked list should give you the expected results. If you are using linked lists already, then there may be a resource issue. Insertion sort has the potential for larger space requirements.";;
Ah! This is the answer I was looking for. Thank you!;;
"
I would expect selection sort to be slightly faster, if you're not using a linked-list structure. With insertion sort, you will need to repeatedly shift a bunch of elements in the ""sorted"" portion of the array. With selection sort, it's just a simple swap. 
";;
"They both have the same complexity, but which one is faster will vary depending on how costly swaps and accesses are and how random or ordered the data is. If the data is almost sorted, insertion sort really shines there because the inner loop finishes when the current item is in the right place, so it doesn't have to traverse all the remaining data on every iteration. For example, if you have

    1 2 3 4 6 5 7 8 9

Insertion sort would first check the 2 against the 1, which is in the right place. Next iteration it checks the 3 vs the 2, which is in the right place. Next it checks the 4 vs the 3, which is in the right place. Then it checks the 6 vs the 4, which is in the right place. Then it checks the 5 vs the 6, swaps them, checks the 5 vs the 4, they are now in the right place. And it continues till its done. This is a really simple example because only one item out of ten was out of place, and it was only off by one spot, but you can see that on each pass, every item that was already in the right place only needed 1 check and no swaps. Insertion sort excels at nearly sorted data and is commonly used for the last few passes of more complex sorting algorithms. 

In contrast, selection sort would have to do the full n(n-1)/2 checks to perform the 1 needed swap. On the first pass, you check the 1 versus all other items in order to select the lowest value out of all remaining unsorted values. There is no value lower than 1, so 1 is placed (or remains) in the first spot. At this point, the entire process must be repeated for 2 because we know nothing about the remaining items. Every pass, the current lowest item has to be checked against every other remaining item to find the lowest remaining item. 

So it really depends. ";;
Perhaps the inputs you are using. Selection sort does not do as much swaps as insertion sort does. Plus, insertion sort's best case scenarii is when the input is close to being sorted.;;

What do you mean by that? I log the total_received at the end. If you mean for each call to NUH_timed_receive() then no, but since it only increases total_received after it finishes, then the amount of bytes received would be off I'd notice it immediately. 
";;
"> I am writing the entire buffer.

So what if it takes 2 socket reads to get the entire file?";;
If you're referring to how receive_to_file() expects a full buffer, I forgot to update that but it's updated now as to how it appears in the server file. It still doesn't work unfortunately.;;
So when you do subsequence receives, are you telling it to still receive into the same buffer starting at position zero every time?;;
"I already fixed it, but to answer your question, yes. When I finish receiving, what is read into the buffer is returned, and when receive is called again, it will receive into the same buffer at position zero. The amount received is returned, so even if half of the buffer is new data and the other half is old, as long as you only read up to how much is returned, it'll be fine. 

The buffer is pretty much my lazy-implementation of a circular/ring buffer. However, after saying this, I realize something really bad I missed...

I reused the same buffer for all receives, which I lazily expanded to using it for sending and receiving files as well... and a simple mutex would remove the concurrent aspects of it. That's bad... I'll have to find some way to actually implement a concurrent ring buffer.";;

Edit: I printed each line it sends to the log file, and it looks like it actually does send everything. Even newlines are sent individually, so formatting shouldn't be as bad as it's appearing. The browser is handling receiving the data, so it shouldn't be a problem. I wonder what went wrong.";;
"I'm not sure I follow the logic of the code, but `NUH_timed_receive()` seems not to read an entire buffer of data, but only does a single `recv()`? I don't know what the `TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY` is, but in any case if it calls `recv()` multiple times it would appear that it always calls it with the same number of parameters, so unless the buffer happens to be completely filled on the first try, it will never be filled and/or parts of it will be overwritten. What's the idea here?

The logic in `NU_Client_receive_to_file()` seems to assume that the buffer will be filled, but since it probably won't when the communication is going over the network, it looks like it's going to get one partially filled buffer of data, write it to the file, and then give up.

How is the buffer size decided? If it's larger than the packet size of the network, your code looks like it certainly is going to lose data.
";;
"The [TEMP_FAILURE_RETRY](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Interrupted-Primitives.html) is a glibc macro that restarts the system call if errno points to EINTR from a signal.

timed_receive() doesn't have to read the entire buffer of data, just as much as it has to, and receive_to_file() just has to write what it received to file and ask for more from the socket. 

I fixed NU_Client_receive_to_file(), I forgot to update it as I did in server, but the problem still remains. Now it writes any amount of bytes it can receive rather than expecting a full buffer. 

> How is the buffer size decided? If it's larger than the packet size of the network, your code looks like it certainly is going to lose data.

The buffer size is determined by the caller, and it's used to write a max amount of data into blocks of data into a file. If the data received is less than the buffer, then it just writes it. If it is more than, it should remain in the stream until it asks for more. It's more or less to allow the user to choose between whether they want more file writes vs more memory used for a larger buffer.";;

"Ok, I checked again and both versions work perfectly in Windows 7.

But then I realized it still may not work inside DOSBox, so I tried it there, and lo and behold, it failed!

It seems the DOSBox set of DOS commands is very limited, and very old. So while 'CHOICE' exists, it does not handle the '/T' default timeout parameter. And 'PING', 'SLEEP', 'WAIT' etc are unavailable. Even 'TIME' is missing!

So what now? Yes, of course! Write your own DOS command! So I wrote it in C++ and tried it out. It worked perfectly, but only in Windows.

Ok, not giving up yet. I located and downloaded [Borland Turbo C++ v1.01](http://edn.embarcadero.com/museum/antiquesoftware), which is freeware now. Installing it inside DOSBox made it possible to write this program, which is an extremely simple sleep command, and I named it ""sleeper.cpp"", so the resulting command will be ""sleeper.exe"", so as not to risk overwriting any existing 'SLEEP' command:

    /*
        sleeper.cpp
    
        2015-07-04  07.56


        An extremely simple 'SLEEPER' command, lacking error messages.
        If called with no or more than one argument, it fails silently.

        Usage  : SLEEPER <number_of_seconds>
        Example: SLEEPER 2
    */

    #include <stdlib.h>
    #include <time.h>
    
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
        if (argc == 2) {
            int delay = atol(argv[1]);
            while (1.0*clock()/CLOCKS_PER_SEC < delay) {
                // Nothing here, move along...
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

Now you can call the 'sleeper' command from a BAT-file:

    @rem Turn off echoing of the commands themselves
    @echo off
    
    rem Print first message
    echo Hello.
    
    rem This line waits for 2 seconds!
    sleeper 2
    
    rem Print next message
    echo How are you?
    
    rem Ok, quit (but wait so we see the previous message)
    pause

So now just either download and install Turbo C++ inside DOSBox and compile the program yourself or send me some mail address I can send the exe to. And even if you want me to send you the executable, I would recommend installing TC++; programming is fun, and then you can write all DOS commands you need.

Commit saves your work locally.  Push shoves your changes back to the server.  Pull pulls all changes from the server since you last pulled to your local copy of things.;;
Which VCS are you using?;;
Using Git with BitBucket;;
Note that early on, you can ignore Bitbucket. That is, you don't need a remote copy of the repo. You can do everything locally, and introduce the remote only once you've got an understanding of the basics.;;
Except that OP is working on a group project, so that's not really an option.;;
"Well there is this great tutorial that explains most of what you are having issues understand is really good details.

It is labeled ""advanced git"", but it explains a lot of basic things too (rebase vs merge for example).";;
"Commit & Push
---------
 Let's take [jQuery as an example](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commits/master). You can see a list of the most recent ""commits"". Every commit is simply a set of changes, you can see them by simply clicking on a commit. At the same time, a commit is also a snapshot of your entire codebase, or whatever you're managing with Git.

Now, you can see a whole lot of commits on this page, from many different people. How did they get there? People uploaded their commits, that they have done on their own computers to github. This is done with a ""push"". You know push notifications, where servers can send notifications directly to your phone? With a ""push"", you send commits to a server, like BitBucket.


Pull vs Fetch
----------------

For this, I would recommend using a graphical client such as [SmartGit](http://www.syntevo.com/smartgit/), their user interface is much better than SourceTree's IMHO.

You can *always* do a fetch without having any fear. It's the counterpart to push: It fetches commits from a server. That way, you get to see what commits people have uploaded to the server since you last checked.

If you use SmartGit's log, you'll be able to see those commits with the top-most being marked ""origin/branchname"", i.e. on the server you named origin, there is a branch named ""branchname"", that currently points to that commit.

You can then merge/rebase/whatever you want to do.

Pull is two commands after one another: first the fetch command, followed by a merge. I'd recommend you just do fetches and merges or rebases manually for now, with the Log view from SmartGit.

Another trick: before doing something, for convenience, you can attach an additional branch to your current commit, such that you can easily go back if you muck something up. There are other ways to go back if you know a little bit more about Git (again, SmartGit could help you there with a simplified view of that information), but that's not important for now.

 merge vs rebase
-------------------

Slightly more complicated to explain. A merge simply combines two versions.

A rebase is totally different. Say you and your mate both clone the repository anew, the latest thing that had been done was adding ""index.html"". Now, you friend creates some commits, then he pushes them to BitBucket.

In the meantime, you also create some commits, on different parts of the project (different lines in the same file will usually work as well).

Now if you wanted to upload your commits to BitBucket, i.e. push them, BitBuck would complain, because your work isn't ""based"" on your mate's changes. Remember, you both started with the same version of the code. He then uploaded a new version. BitBucket expects you to upload commits that change *his* version of the code.

Fortunately, Git lets you pretend that you actually made your changes to your mate's new version, even though you used the older ""index.html"" version. This is a rebase, it changes ""the basis"" upon which your changes were made, so to speak.


Simply hit me up with a PM if you need some hands on help.";;
">Pull vs. Fetch 

Fetch gets changes from the remote (the repo on bitbucket). Pull will do the same, but also merge the changes into your working copy. You usually want this. I can't recall ever having to use fetch. It's something you can ignore until you need.

>Merge vs. Rebase vs Branch default 

This is not important to beginner. You do not need to know what rebase is at all and should skip it for now.

I'm not sure what you mean by ""branch default"".

>Push vs. Commit

A commit will add some changes (along with a commit message describing what changed) to you *local repo*. Remember that git is decentralized. This means everyone has their own repo. That repo on Bitbucket is called the remote. It's simply there so that other users can get a copy of your repo.

So after committing, only you can see the commit. Pushing will send the changes to the remote, effectively making your repo the new remote repo. If anyone else has pushed first, this will fail. You must pull those changes before you can successfully push yours.

Alternatively (and NEVER, EVER do this unless you know what you're doing), you could force the push (with `git push --force`). This will OVERWRITE whatever changes the remote has that you don't (which is why you shouldn't use it outside of emergency situations). This command is most commonly used in programmer's jokes.

>Trying to use VCS has been a nightmare and any help/resources would be appreciate :)

I think you're trying to learn too much. Only the last point is really needed to use Git properly. You do not need to know the more advanced parts of git. Not now, anyway.

## Mock tutorial

Let's create a repo. We'll start without a remote, because they aren't needed.

    $ git init my_repo
    Initialized empty Git repository in /cygdrive/f/Documents/t/my_repo/.git/

We've now created a repo called ""my_repo"" in the working directory. I have created a ""readme.txt"" inside the repo using my text editor.

    cd my_repo/
	$ git status
	On branch master

	Initial commit

	Untracked files:
	  (use ""git add <file>..."" to include in what will be committed)

	        readme.txt

	nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use ""git add"" to track)

Git status just tells us data. We can see we're in the master branch and that ""readme.txt"" has not been committed. It's not part of the repo and exists only locally. If I delete it, I can't recover it. Let's add it to the repo by committing it. You must use `git add <filename>` to tell git what files will be committed.

    $ git add readme.txt
	$ git commit
	[master (root-commit) 6308c94] My commit
	 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
	 create mode 100644 readme.txt

After typing `git commit`, you should see an editor that will let you enter a commit message. Use this to describe your change. As you can see, we've now committed the file into my local repo. It's commit `6308c94`. If we try to push:

	$ git push
	fatal: No configured push destination.
	Either specify the URL from the command-line or configure a remote repository using

	    git remote add <name> <url>

	and then push using the remote name

	    git push <name>

We get an error, since we don't have a remote (and don't need one). Let's look at our commit history:

	$ git log
	commit 6308c948c7dbd8010d54e9ddd2c74aea5e9d5e66
	Author: [Removed]
	Date:   Thu Jul 2 20:53:45 2015 -0600

	    My commit

We can see that my commit is in the repo. I can now get the repo back to how it was at the time of committing with `git checkout 6308c948`. Let's make a change to that file. Having done so, `git status` now says:

	$ git status
	On branch master
	Changes not staged for commit:
	  (use ""git add <file>..."" to update what will be committed)
	  (use ""git checkout -- <file>..."" to discard changes in working directory)

	        modified:   readme.txt

	no changes added to commit (use ""git add"" and/or ""git commit -a"")

We can see that git recognized the file as changed. It is not committed yet and has not been added. A shortcut to commit all changed files is with `git commit -a`:

	$ git commit -a
	[master 7a82940] Another change
	 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

Which once again opened my editor for a commit message. Now I can see both commits are clearly a part of the repo:

	$ git log
	commit 7a829407d6d0caa2ac0ef675419c32fe5e765c62
	Author: [Removed]
	Date:   Thu Jul 2 20:58:34 2015 -0600

	    Another change

	commit 6308c948c7dbd8010d54e9ddd2c74aea5e9d5e66
	Author: [Removed]
	Date:   Thu Jul 2 20:53:45 2015 -0600

	    My commit

Now let's create a remote. On [bitbucket, I am given information on how to register a remote](http://i.imgur.com/tVwl0yI.png). Let's run those commands:

	$ git remote add origin https://MikeHoffert@bitbucket.org/MikeHoffert/test-repo.git
	$ git push -u origin --all
	Password for 'https://MikeHoffert@bitbucket.org':
	Counting objects: 6, done.
	Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (6/6), 520 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
	Total 6 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
	To https://MikeHoffert@bitbucket.org/MikeHoffert/test-repo.git
	 * [new branch]      master -> master
	Branch master set up to track remote branch master from origin.

And now all my commits have been pushed. If we check the Bitbucket log, we can clearly see all those commits are there. Now say that someone else made a change to the repo. An easy way to try this is to edit your files online (which Bitbucket allows). Now try and pull:

	$ git pull
	remote: Counting objects: 3, done.
	remote: Compressing objects: 100% (2/2), done.
	remote: Total 3 (delta 1), reused 0 (delta 0)
	Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
	From https://bitbucket.org/MikeHoffert/test-repo
	   7a82940..150cfc6  master     -> origin/master
	Updating 7a82940..150cfc6
	Fast-forward
	 readme.txt | 2 ++
	 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

If we check the log, we can see our commit. `git diff` can be used to see what exactly changed (the `^` means ""commit before this one"" -- the parent commit):

	$ git log
	commit 150cfc68cf57455651d7dbcc9a2925ca4619fc04

I might not start with something that requires publishing files to a device and requires using some API that's not used anywhere else.  I'd get decent at another language first, probably.;;
"Swift is a very new language, and as such, the learning resources out there, and the amount of discussion on SO would be lower compared to other languages like JavaScript or Python which have been out there for much longer. So with Swift specifically, I doubt that the learning curve would be much steeper than say Objective-C or Java. 

IMO JavaScript would be a better first language even if you want to to mobile development, since you can use stuff like PhoneGap or NativeScript to build mobile apps of moderate complexity.";;
I would recommend Java to a beginner with interests in mobile app development. It's fine for developing on Android devices and will allow you to branch out to other things later without having to learn an entire new language. It is unlikely that Swift will be used much at all for anything outside Apple app development so why not leave your options open?;;
My trouble with starting with mobile apps is that the learning curve for mobile development is really high when compared to writing your own programs or building web pages like you said. The reason I'd start with another language like the other guy said is because by the time you're experienced enough to actually understand what the hell is going on with mobile, the syntax of Swift vs. something like Python or Java would be easy enough.;;
"Run away now. 

Seriously.  They want a web developer and you aren't one. This will only end in frustration.  

The advice you're getting here (using WYSIWYG frameworks and image-splitters) will work for a short time and I guarantee either solution will cause you problems in the long run.

If you want to develop a web site, don't take any shortcuts. Learn web development. By hand. No image-slicing, no WYSIWYG, not even Dreamweaver, unless you use it in code mode.  

The stuff you're wanting to do is pretty easy for a pro.  But you aren't one.  Either become one, or recommend they hire one.  Don't pretend to know something you don't.  If you get hired, you won't really be able to do what they want. If you don't get hired, you still don't have a job.

dream weaver can make this a very easy process. Just do a wysiwyg program. Or do it in Photoshop and upload it. Photoshop does more than make pictures. No coding required. Probably not the best advice but it still works. ;;

I've been on the the internet since 1999. Why am I still in the dark about all of this? There's so much out there... what the hell have I been doing all this time? ;;
"Wysiwyg editors are a tool, and like any other tool they have their advantages and disadvantages. Many devs avoid them, though it could be quite useful for your situation. However, you will HAVE to learn proper html and css if you want to stay there. The wysiwyg editor is just a very temporary solution. 

Many others use some template and code their requirements around it. ";;
" I like your comment.

I agree with you about a wysiwyg being a helpful but temporary solution. 

 I suggested it because it is so typical of jobs to say they want the aesthetics and then say they want the programing as well. Since it would not be hard to learn to make a website I just suggested a instant gratification solution to buy the time needed to learn the necessary code.  ";;
"Don't feel bad about not knowing about them. It is true that most avoid them. But, lots of entrepreneurs who are new to the internet use them until A. they get enough money to hire someone or B. they have enough time to learn how to make their website better.

I agree that a wysiwyg is a temporary solution but if you are like me you need the job and can appease in the short term and learn for the long term.

I'm willing to learn. I started the Odin Project last night, and completed the Railsbridge Installfest (even though I had zero idea what I was doing the entire time). Apparently everything is set up appropriately and fully updated. Now I just have no idea how to use any of it.;;
Do not run away like the the top comment is saying.  Most people learn this stuff on the job.  ;;
I'm not. This is only a small aspect of the job I'm trying to get, which is mainly centered around PR and policy communication. My thoughts are- build the site then get the job promoting the subject matter out in the real world with the site as a way to give people a place to find the information that they want to know.;;
Good luck! I am in a similar situation.;;
You are biting off a lot for someone who's still learning. That being said, we're all still learning. The best way to learn is to get started building, even if you're not sure how you'll be able to finish the project. My personal vote would be for taking your ruby knowledge and going with rails and mysql (or postgres), that's a tried and true stack that'll spare you from some of the details, yet let you build anything you want.;;
"Oh yeah, I know. It's probably going to be too much, but I'd like to give it a try.

I definitely like the idea of continuing with Ruby. Should I not be concerned about the size of the database, or can mysql or postgres handle something that large reasonably quickly?";;
They're both good choices for really large datasets like that - they've been around forever and they're well-supported. My advice would be to put off importing *all* of that data until you're sure you've got all your tables and fields setup right - you don't want to have to frequently re-do an import that big!;;
"http://www.freecodecamp.com/

Peruse the map section to get an idea what you could learn from this. Its going to take time to learn the technologies you will need for your project.";;
That certainly looks promising, thank you!;;
Many people follow [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). So x.y.z, where x = major version, y = minor version, z = build number. Increase the major version if you've broken something in a non-backward compatible way. Change y if you've added functionality in a backward compatible way. Change z if you've just fixed some bugs or added some very small things.;;
"Call it whatever the fuck you want, man. It's your program.

Hell, I'd call it 1.bugfix, or 1.omega., or 1.111.

At the end of the day, it's entirely up to you.";;
"One common convention is that you have a major version number and a minor version number; the major version number is used to indicate incompatible versions (but some use it to indicate any major change), whereas the minor version is incremented for each release.

That means that version 1.1 is followed by 1.2, and so on, and only goes to 2.0 if you make a version that is no longer compatible with previous versions (making it essentially a different program). You might also have a third number to indicate bug fixes, and use the second number to indicate only added functionality. Generally, whenever you change one of the numbers, the more minor numbers are reset to 0, so 1.2.3 -> 1.3.0 and 2.3.4 -> 3.0.0 etc.

But like /u/drunk_hal said, use whatever scheme you like. There are no rules you have to follow. You can use names instead of numbers, a mixture of both, only a single number, or whatever.

"Since you're the developer, you make up the rules for naming each new version of the program.

However, it is to your benefit to have a naming scheme that makes sense.

If I was making a versioning scheme, I might do something like the following:

I might go from v1.0 to v2.0 when I release what I consider to be a major update with new features, critical bug fixes, and other big changes.

I might go from v1.0 to v1.1 when I am doing a release of a feature that I haven't fully finished yet, somewhat like a beta or alpha release.

I might go from v1.0 to v1.01 with a minor bug fix.

CheckUserInput should use the 'directions' array,  not hardcode the directions again.;;
"Ah OK. Do you mean something like this?


    case directions[0]:
        return true;

";;
Directions shouldn't be an array. Look up how to implement enumerations. ;;
I would use enums instead of strings for the directions.;;
"I won't repeat what others said.

1. Instead of `Console.WriteLine("")`, you can use `Console.WriteLine()`. You do this in some places. May as well be consistent.
2. Once you are using an enum for directions, use [`Enum.Parse`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/kxydatf9%28v=vs.110%29.aspx) to convert user input to the enum.
3. Avoid static. Create some maze object that you can use for containing the state of ... whatever you're trying to do. This would become useful if you were to expand your application so that you can move through the maze for real (in which case you'd need to keep track of the maze, where the player is, etc).

It's pretty hard to give meaningful comments when the program does nothing of use. In the future, I recommend making programs where it's clear what the program does. This will ensure that we can tell intended behavior from bugs.

Should you actually allow the player to move for real and all (your program doesn't really do anything useful), you should do something like store the maze as a 2D array of ""cells"" in which you might use spaces to show walkable cells). You'd then want to keep track of the player's coordinates (in the array) and the coordinates of the start and end cells.

Then the player's position would get updated based on the chosen move (obtained from user input). You could simply check if the cell that the player would end up on is walkable (if not, yell at the player for choosing an invalid move). Could also make your program print out what directions can be walked in (by checking if cells to the up, down, left, and right directions are walkable).

When printing the array out, you'd check if the cell you're printing is the player's coordinates. If so, print a marker for the player. Otherwise print a space (if walkable) or something else if not walkable (should make this character consistent, though).

If the player's coordinate reach the ""end"" coordinate, then the game has been won (and now it's a real game).

Once working, extend your program to also ask the user for how many steps to take in the chosen direction. Take care not to walk through any walls. Also make sure you don't go out of bounds (the out of bounds should be treated as if it were a wall).";;

"/u/dGraves is dead on. I just wanted to add some illustrations.

When you do this:

    Int[] ghq = new Int[10]
You're telling the computer to allocate space in memory for 10 integers. Additionally, the computer (usually) starts counting at zero (this is important). So in memory, you have something like this (I'm going to go ahead and put the numbers 10 through 19 into the array also)

    [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]
Each element in the array has an associated index. The first element is index 0, and then the index increments by one for each spot in the array, so your last index here would be 9. Here is the same array with the indexes shown above each element.

    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9

Note that ghq.length will be 10, because there are 10 integers in the array, but the actual indexes start at 0, so you have index 0 through index 9 to work with. There are lots of things you can do with arrays, and one of those things is [iterate](http://www.computerhope.com/jargon/i/iteration.htm) over it. You're doing this with a for loop, like so:

    For(i = 0; i < ghq.length; i++)
    {
        system.out.println(ghq.get[i]);
    }
This for loop says to use a counter variable called ""i"" with a starting value of 0 (i = 0), to loop while ""i"" is less than ghq.length (which again is 10), and to increment ""i"" by one each time through the loop. ""i++"" is the same as ""i = i + 1"", or ""i += 1"", by the way. It just means ""add 1 to i"". And then the for loop executes the code inside the curly braces each time through.

Inside the loop, we use the counter variable from the for loop's declaration as the index for the array, in order to print each element. Incidentally, I'm assuming here that ghq.get[i] is the correct syntax. In the languages with which I am familiar, one would usually just do ghq[i]. So when you run this with the integers I used above, you would see this as output:

    10
    11
    12
    13
    14
    15
    16
    17
    18
    19

Does that help at all?";;
Great answer bro;;
Thank you!;;
"The for loop is searching through the array from 0 to the length of the array. For each step, the variable ""i"" increases.

So when you print out [i] you're telling the computer to print out whatever step it is on during the search. The for loop and whatever code is inside the body will repeat itself until it reaches the end of the array.

Hopefully this is understandable. And please correct me if I'm wrong about something.";;
"Sorry, I don't know what language this is.  Usually if you create an array you don't need to use `get` but just use the brackets, e.g., `ghq[i]`.

The `for` loop, in this example, just lets you visit every item in your array.";;

When I executed it, it seemed to do everything up until it got to the file with the game data inside it. In this case, ARENA.

alright, (and I'm terribly sorry about this) can you explain these a bit more? I'm a beginner, I've no idea what those are xD.;;
"Sure!

Just so we are on the same page regarding how to create the BAT file:

* The BAT file is a simple script file, as you probably already know. You can make one by simply creating a text file and renaming it from x.txt to x.bat, but that assumes you actually can see file extensions. If you don't, then start an explorer window, access folder and search settings or what the are called, and find and uncheck ""Hide file extensions for known file types"" (or something like that).
* Ok, so assume you have your x.bat file (which should have some cogwheels to show it's a BAT file). Now right click and edit!

The commands in my examples mean the following, and this is my second example:

* **""C:\\Program Files (x86)\\DOSBox-0.74\\DOSBox.exe""** means to start DOSBox
* **-c ""mount C C:\\DosBox""** means to mount the actual directory on your hard drive 'C:\\DosBox' as the virtual drive 'C:' in DosBox, so that when referring to it when inside DosBox, you just say C:
* **-c ""C:""** means to run the command 'C:' in DOS, meaning to change default drive to C:
* **-c ""cd \\daggerdir""** sets the default directory (inside DosBox) to 'daggerdir', which is the actual directory 'C:\\DosBox\\daggerdir'
* **-c ""dagger.exe""** means start the game!

Hope this clarified the example BAT-file.";;

It depends on the position.  Just be honest.  It's hard to gauge programming proficiency in general.

This will vary from person to person.  My guess is it's best to be consistent.  Study at the same time of day for the same duration.  Maybe 2-4 hours per day seems long enough to be useful without getting burned out.";;

"May I ask why you chose Python? Although I wouldn't refer to it as being a niche language yet, I wouldn't personally recommend learning it as a way to boost your resume. I just received a Bachelor's in CS and Python was not mentioned once, ever. 

I think Java would have a better presence on a resume, especially for a non-technical career (only assuming this) as it is widely recognized and increasingly prevalent (Android, web servers, etc). Not to mention that there is probably much more learning material out there for it.";;
"> I just received a Bachelor's in CS and Python was not mentioned once, ever. 

I think this depends on region -- it's mentioned fairly frequently where I go to school + knowing it is seen as a bonus.

> I think Java would have a better presence on a resume, especially for a non-technical career (only assuming this) as it is widely recognized and increasingly prevalent (Android, web servers, etc).

However, if OP is in a non-technical career, Python might be more practical on a day-to-day basis then Java -- it's easier to automate/script tasks in Python.

> Not to mention that there is probably much more learning material out there for it.

Python is the [#1 most commonly taught language](http://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/176450-python-is-now-the-most-popular-introductory-teaching-language-at-top-us-universities/fulltext) in Universities, with Java following closely behind as #2.

I'd argue that both languages have roughly an equal amount of learning resources, though Python probably has a slight edge now, due to it's popularity as a teaching language in MOOCs and the like. 

";;
"I have 2 questions if you don't mind.

1. So are there lot of jobs provided with python compared to other languages?

2. Although I'm not completely fixated in getting a programming job, let's say there's few that requires programming languages excluding Python. Can I still get a job for it?";;
This mainly depends on the job market. In the Computer Science world, there are jobs for every language under the sun. You want to research what language would complement the major best.;;
"> So are there lot of jobs provided with python compared to other languages?

This is going to be a bit of a cop-out answer -- I don't have any firm answers for you. Informally, from what I've been observing, Python is used fairly frequently. I don't know if it has quite as many jobs as say Java might, but it's definitely not niche in any sense. This will also vary from region to region -- different parts of the world will prefer to use different programming languages for a variety of reasons. 

However, part of the reason why this is a copout answer + I don't have any hard numbers is because I honestly don't pay attention to programming languages when applying to jobs. 

More specifically, I feel that it is a losing strategy in general to just know only a single programming language. Trends come and go, and I think somebody who is proficient in multiple programming languages + knows how to learn new languages very rapidly is going to be far more valuable then somebody who knows only one. 

As a result, I also feel that if somebody wants to have a long-term career as a programmer, then whether or not their first language is used in the industry or not shouldn't be a factor at all. If they can learn one language, they should be able to in theory pick up most other mainstream languages fairly rapidly by self-teaching. 

However, if somebody doesn't necessarily want to be a programmer, then yeah, the first choice does matter since most non-programmers are not going to want to invest the time to learn multiple languages. If they want to do EE, perhaps C might be a good choice, if they work with excel perhaps VBA or C#, if they're a scientist or mathematician perhaps Python, Matlab, R, etc...

> Although I'm not completely fixated in getting a programming job, let's say there's few that requires programming languages excluding Python. Can I still get a job for it?

This depends on several factors. But to generalize, if it's a senior level position where they're looking for people with X amount of experience in a given technology, then it may be difficult to get in. However, if it's an entry-level position, and you can show you have a decent amount of experience with Python + have a portfolio of projects you've completed and can talk about + can show that you're able to learn, you might be able to get in.

Basically, what you're trying to do is to demonstrate that you have the ability to program, which is a skill that is much more difficult to acquire compared to learning a new language.

But diversification definitely helps. If you know a good subset of the mainstream languages (Java, C#, Python, C++, C, Objective-C, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, etc...), then you're pretty much automatically eligible for most programming languages out there. It might sound like an overwhelming list of languages to learn, but they share many of the same core ideas and principles so if you know one, it's much easier to learn another.";;
"I've heard that Python is widely taught in universities, but it's primarily used for the introductory courses to teach the basic concepts of programming in general as there is a lot overhead in Java/C that newcomers are told to ""just ignore for now, that's covered in more advance topics"" as to not turn them away from the major. It is then normally phased out within the primary required courses while maybe being used in various electives.

Personally if I was just looking to automate task, I wouldn't use an OOP language at all haha";;
I'm a mechanical engineering major and I've researched multiple and was told that Java is really not recommended for the first programming language due to its complexity and I agree with it as I've taken computer 101 course and it was quite confusing; I've taken it during freshman year and I barely remember anything... Best language to learn seemed to be either Python or Javascript so I chose Python though...;
"Ah okay Mech E is a major that would benefit from Python and you are right in that you'd primarily benefit from being very good in one language rather than at programming in general. An ME friend of mine  was recently hired and he told me ""in the current mechanical world, being fluent and experienced, almost a master, in MATLAB holds much more weight with employers than having a working knowledge of Python, or any other programming language come to think of it, unless you have a portfolio of scripts that you have used to solve problems with in the past."" 

So I'd say if you're very interested in the world of programming and plan on doing it on your own, go for Python (and use the skills learned to specialize in the career/job market you're involved in).

Otherwise, go with MATLAB for general mechanical engineering as it is always useful. It really comes down to what your ideal career would be.";;
When I'm hiring, I feel that any meaningful experience a candidate may have is more about completed projects than it is about a certain length of time. If you can show me a few programs, scripts or sites that you've built using python, and I'm looking for a entry to intermediate level python developer, I'm interested, no matter how short a time you've been learning.;;
"This is pretty common. Search the sub for ""unix"" and ""linux"".

Note that nobody actually means that you should use Unix, but rather a Unix-like OS (Linux is the most popular variant, but others include OSes like FreeBSD and OS X).

The gist of the difference comes down to the fact that Linux was made with programmers in mind and largely tries to cater to them. As a result, some programs, languages, and programming tools are either only available on Linux or have some advantages to using them on Linux (such as better support or improved UX).";;

Yes, OS X has a fair bit in common with Linux. You can utilize the POSIX APIs and many command line utilities will be the same. ";;

"I was learning Ruby on Rails for a while in Windows and I had a bunch of headaches with installation of things.  I went through The Rails Way 3.0 and a Tutorial from Lynda.com and the installation always crapped out and made me spend hours troubleshooting.

I haven't tried Ubuntu or OSX yet but I heard this type of thing should not happen due to the nature of installing apps.";;
"There's no one standout thing, imo. Some nicer things people tend to mention are:

- You can do pretty much everything via the command line (and it's natural to do so), which means that everything is scriptable and automatable.
- You get a package management system -- there's really no more need to manually install anything ever again/look through sketchy websites + hunt for downloads.
- It's infinitely configurable.
- Many programming tools were tested/developed on Linux before being ported over to Windows. That means that the likelihood of a tool actually working is higher on Linux vs Windows. (For example, take Ruby -- they still haven't got their shit together + made everything work nicely on Windows).
- Windows does not come built-in with many tools intended for power users and developers -- you have to install them all. 
- Many people find the open-source nature of Linux more ideologically palatable then Window's closed-world model. 

However, I feel the real reason why many people recommend Linux over Windows is because as you get more experience, Windows can sometimes start to feel like a death by a thousand papercuts. It might seem fine and dandy for normal use, and if you're willing to put in the effort for doing some basic setup and configuration, Windows will work just fine the majority of the time, but there's always some issue or quirk that pops up that would have been a total non-issue in Linux. (My latest issues? I can't get Vim-Airline's fancy fonts to work properly on Windows, and my system path has run out of room (Windows apparently has a character limit)). 

So, it's not that Linux is outstandingly better then Windows. It's just that when it comes to software development, Linux is set up a little better + has historically catered to developers that as a result, Windows is tarnished with a slight patina of yuck. 

However, I would also strongly encourage you to keep an open mind + try out both for a year or two to compare and contrast the differences for yourself. Everybody uses their computers differently, and things that are a dealbreaker for me may be completely irrelevant to you, and vice-versa.";;
Thank you, this really explains it all. Are these advantages of Linux not applicable to OS X? ;;
"Actually, it turns out most, if not all of the good things about Linux are also available on OS X. Macs are ~~built on top of Linux~~ a variant of Unix, so get to inherit many of the same advantages.

Many programmers will actually use Macs because they strike a good balance between developer-friendliness and user-friendliness. All the Unix/Linux stuff is present, but Apple tends to make polished products (Unix/Linux is community-driven, so the user experience can sometimes be inconsistent, though this is improving).

I personally don't like Macs myself because I never did get the hang of their keyboard shortcuts (a stupid reason, I know), and because I don't really like being tied in to their platform, but I know that many developers that enjoy using Macs. 

";;
"> Macs are built on top of Linux

What???";;
"Whoops, typo.

To be more specific, OS X is based on BSD, and so isn't a part of the Linux family tree -- it would be more accurate to say that OS X is variant of Unix. 

That said, I think the thrust of my main point still stands. Setting aside Unix vs Linux pedantry, the way you would use a Mac computer is basically the same as how you would use a Linux computer (OS X is POSIX-compliant, has all the same tools, has basically the same file system structure, etc).

I argue that there is not a significant difference between how you would use the two on a day-to-day basis, especially in comparison to Windows.";;
"As a programmer, for me, it's much more natural to work in a command shell.  Before power shell (which I haven't used) the windows shell (cmd.exe, I think) was mostly useless.  I haven't used windows in almost 15 years.

Note that using actual UNIX is pretty rare these days, but you'd instead use a *POSIX* compatible operating system.  This includes linux and osx and solaris, etc.

Generally, as a beginner, you'll be fine with windows for quite a long time.  Learning programming in linux isn't going to make you a better programmer.  But learning a new environment is always beneficial until you get so frustrated that you rage quit.  Try to avoid this.

Good luck!

";;
OSX is an actual Unix, Linux is a kernel not an operating system.;;
You can use exactly the same shell (probably bash, but there are others) on Windows as you can on Linux. Almost all  the other standard Linux command line utilities are also available on Windows.;;
Probably true, but there are other reasons why I now prefer OSX.  I'm not a windows hater or anything, but just prefer OSX.;;
"I would say that they're already ordered roughly in the order which you should work through the courses. A typical courseload would be somewhere from 2-3 courses a term, perhaps up to 4, depending on the course. Start from the top, and work your way down, jumping around a little depending on what you find interesting.

After you clear the first few intro courses, there usually isn't a strict order. 

If you have no background in programming/do not know how to program, I'd just do one intro course by itself, and _maybe_ do one of the intro discrete math courses if you're up for it (it's totally ok to put that off though). I think there's also an ""intro to linux/bash"" course buried in there somewhere -- it would be useful to do it sooner rather then later (though it's also not something you need to do immediately).

After clearing the ""intro to programming"" courses, then you should perhaps focus on clearing the discrete math, data structures + algorithms, and the system design courses next, since many of the upcoming courses directly or indirectly have those courses as prerequisites.

"Small criticisms about the interface: there's really no point in having to type in `https://github.com` all the time since your code targets only Github. It would be nice to be able to omit it.

Major criticisms about the code:

- You should really split your code up into multiple functions instead of having one giant ""god"" function.
- You repeat code in multiple places -- for example, the code to check if something is a valid url or not, or a code to make a request, or the code to display an error message. Those should all refactored into multiple functions.
- Not super crucial, but try taking a look at the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) library -- it's often nicer to use then urllib.

I'm assuming that you're new to programming, but if you weren't aware before, lack of refactoring and redundancy are generally considered to be sins/a huge red flag in software development. 

They also make it increasingly harder to work on your code: if you copy-paste the same code 5 or 6 times, when you make a change to one, you have to waste time going around changing the others + hoping you didn't forget one. For smaller projects, it might not matter much, but if you have a project several hundred files big, things get much more difficult.

"Two quick suggestions:

 * Let the user enter any word or phrase they'd like, up to a certain character limit.

2. You've got magic numbers everywhere. You shouldn't have that hardcode 6 for value of `wrong` where the game is lost. That particular case can be determined from the size of `pics`.

2. Have everyone send you whatever sort of proof they can and manually vet it. People with stuff like `edu` emails can be automatically vetted. There might not be a large audience left after that.

"A string of text is deliminated by spaces usually, so this is the default for a lot of the Scanner methods. Each chunk of lettersumbers between two deliminators (spaces in our case) is called a string token.  You can use these terms to look up more detailed information on text processing.

For your question:

Scanner.nextLine() will return the whole line entered by the user. You can then break down the string in a number of ways. 

Scanner.nextInt() will look at the next string token and return either the int value or an error.

You can do something like 

         while (Scanner.hasNext())
         { 
              if (Scanner.hasNextInt())
                  printf(""%i,"", Scanner.nextInt());
              else
                  scanner.next();
         }

This says: while we still have more tokens to process, check if the next one is an int. If it is, print it out, else goto the next token.

With an input of ""5 fefas 72 2.5 6d2 3"" the result would print 5,72,3.  The other string tokens, fefas, 2.5, and 6d2 would all return an error if nextInt() was called on them.";;
"With the advice already given in this thread, you should probably be able to figure out how to read from a file so I'm not going to repeat the same thing again.

However, another point I wanted to touch one is the use of for vs. while loops.

The main difference in usage between them is that a while loop is usually used in a context where the number of iterations that you will need to make is not clear.  For example, in your case, you ask for user input.  What if the user screws up by putting in ""eighteen""  several times while entering in his age?  A for loop won't properly handle that.  Instead, it might be a good idea to use a while loop because you aren't sure how many times you need to loop.

On the other hand, a for loop is usually used when in a context where you are sure of the number of iterations you need.  To give an example, maybe you need to loop through a 2D array once (as on a game board).  In that case, you would use an outer for loop that uses the length of the outer array as a guard and then your inner for loop would use the length of each inner array as a guard.  In this situation, you likely want to use a for loop over a while loop.

"What's the best way to go around these?

Data science particularly interests me, but at the same time I wonder what web development is like.

It's all so, so confusing and interesting.";;
"Data science is hugely valuable.

IMO, you're closer to the functions of a business.  You can actually understand your clients in engineering, manufacturing, marketing and sales, and finance and their data needs.  You can also sell the need for data analysis and integration to people.

So how about Python and R for things data-science related, and Python + Django (web framework) to build web applications?  You can deploy them as hosted Cloud applications and can get free hosting on Heroku or this one other host people keep mentioning here...

Anyways, I don't see anything that would prevent you from getting into web applications.  You'd learn a lot of the foundational skills in data science, as you'd likely get exposure to mining data off of the web at least once :)

All you'd have to do is persist the data and present it in a web UI and you're golden.  Well off.  Possibly even better off than the average web dev since your skills will transfer to other industries than web.";;
I don't think there is really a best way. I'd suggest trying a few in the areas that interest you and that seem to be at an appropriate level. It may turn out you don't like a topic or a course style.;;
For data science, take a look at this curriculum: http://datasciencemasters.org/;;
"I started the stanford algorithm design course today as I visited that website this morning.

I don't know why, but Clare - the lady who came up with that curriculum - inspired me somehow.";;
Listen to podcasts about them. I'm not sure if there are many data science specific podcasts, but I'm sure there are plenty of podcasts with data science guests. You'll get some knowledge and some entertainment too. The fun part? You can do both.;;
I second this recommendation, and I know there are at least a few data science podcasts! Data Stories is one that has been going on for a while, and fivethirtyeight has just started one called What's The Point. There are probably more as well. :);;

"Is there a way to make a little black border stating ""everything below this line is self-paced""? Keep the formatting the same, just a little horizontal rule to tell us where it goes from a class to self-paced.";;

"at the start of my academic training i would have been all into this. presently i am academically full. i can't go more than 5 minutes into a lecture before turning it off. I read faster than professors talk. I don't know if I read fast but I read faster than human speech and I don't have to listen to anyone but my inner monologue. 

i would love to say i am into moocs. I never finished one but I started taking them after a full term of university study with a degree.

i turned down a free class on audio engineering because a lecture was involved. i am full. i don't mind conversation but if anyone is the same. i am what i am and i know what i know and that's going to have to do. i would love to become omni intelligent and master the world of professors that are available to me. i love that people are educating themselves to a high degree but where when i first heard about these classes theoretically i thought to myself that's all i am going to absorb and become hyper intelligent.

no.

that's not what's happening.

it's not even that i can't stand the lectures. I just feel full. I can't learn any more.

What i am going to learn is going to come from a book.

I might be full.

I might have my knowledge center packed with information in my brain and knowing more is not an option.

I didn't expect that to happen 15 years ago when i stated to a friend who would want to ever stop going to classes or learning.

I am not going to invest 20 good hours in listening to someone when it seems more valuable to spend that time reading and applying what I already know.

In general, you should only use the NDK if it is essential to your app—never because you simply prefer to program in C/C++.

"To explain the difference in OP's URL: the protocol (`http`) IS important. People get used to ignoring it because web browsers automatically figure it out for you.

In a link, `http://localhost/foo` is an absolute URL whereas `localhost/foo` is a relative URL. The latter will look at the current location and append the `localhost/foo` path. So if the current location is `http://localhost/bar`, then it'll look for `http://localhost/bar/localhost/foo`.

Relative paths (which /u/sleepybychoice used) are highly preferable, as you don't need to know the domain, they're immune to many path change (eg, if we move our files into a subdirectory), and they work on any protocol. You want to relative paths whenever possible.

Outside of web dev, you also want relative paths.

"Because you loaded the data frame with text elements (the row that you got rid of), it treats the entire column as text, not numbers. If you decide to work with the data frame as-is, you'll need to convert it to a numeric vector.

Not understanding why this happened :/ Why would it load with text elements? Is it because the row was text and ""shifting"" it up made the first integer a text element, thus the following integers followed? 

EDIT:
The ""as.numeric"" changed the values...

[code]> as.numeric(mydata$ESTAB)

"In statistics, there's two types of observation data: categorical and continuous. Continuous would be things like height, voltage, and weight.

Factors are analogous to categorical variables. Levels are all possible values for a type of factor.

Try this:

You can safely ignore both the responses below. NetBeans IDE has never removed functionality for creating pure JavaScript projects and, yes, indeed, an IDE can be very useful indeed.

Besides the reply of/u/geertjanwielenga which is definitely spot on, you could also use [**Visual Studio Code**](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/code-vs.aspx) from Microsoft (also free) which is tailored for JavaScript and very lightweight.;;

Self-discipline. Pick a language and stick with it until you know it. If you can't do that, we can't help you.;;
"
>I find it hard to pin myself down to just one project, or just one language or whatever type of programming it is. It's a mess. In all this time I've never really accomplished anything.

Jumping around too much is a great way to not accomplish anything. So change that. Pick one thing and follow it thru. Pick one language. Doesn't matter which one, don't overthink it, just pick one. Pick a project, work on it. When you hit a wall, show perseverance and power thru. That's the only way you are gonna make progress. ";;
"step 1: pick a language you want to learn

step 2: go to /r/dailyprogrammer and attempt challenges in your language of choice.

This will force you to learn how to do things in your language and give you a concise goal.  Don't do anything else until you complete the challenge you are working on (unless you need to go learn something else in order to complete the challenge).  Literally only allow yourself to work on that specific problem or anything related to it.  Then do it again.  And again. And again...

Google any problems you come across and seek to understand how the language works rather than copy/pasting the answer.  Read the documentation as you're working.  Listen to lectures on your chosen language.  Seek to understand the core concepts of your language (and programming as a whole).  Read articles about programming, even if you don't understand 90% of it!  Find examples of solutions to problems you are facing.  You don't need to know every single aspect of a language to start using it.  Focus on the small building blocks and really try to understand each one as you use it.  

Also, don't fall into the ""motivation"" trap.  Motivation is bullshit.  It lasts, like you said, for about two weeks. Max.  What you are looking for is **discipline**.  Motivation is a feeling.  Discipline is a decision.  The only way to accomplish what you want to do is with discipline.  Make the commitment to learn for X hours per day and stick to it.  You can't do 10 hours for one day and then come back to it a week later.  Everything you learn compounds on what you learned before.  So you are not taking steps that are a fixed distance.  The longer you code, the bigger your steps get.  

You also need to understand, that you are going to struggle and get pissed and feel incompetent for a while.  Because, guess what? you *are* incompetent right now.  It is normal, you need to accept that implicitly before you start.  You don't start as a black-belt.  You are basically a newborn.  As such, you need to learn how to hold your head up first.  Then how to move your arms and legs, then how to roll your body around.  Then how to crawl... Etc.  Tell yourself every day that you are going to learn how to do something that you couldn't do yesterday.  Don't worry about the endgame here, focus on what you can do/learn today.  Think of it like an rpg game.  Every hour you spend learning adds exp to your coding level.  You have to put in the time to level up.  There are no shortcuts.

Good luck, friend

Source: I'm mostly self-taught, and going through a bootcamp right now.  The most important thing I've learned is to take things a step at a time and trust that over time, I will be able to put things together that I can't even dream of at the moment.  You can check out some of my postings to r/dailyprogrammer to see some of my progression.  I have improved leaps and bounds since I first started in late March, 2015.  I still have a ways to go, but every day I am learning faster and faster.  Now I am able to figure out problems that used to take me several hours in like 5 - 20 minutes.

Awesome piece of advice. I'm building a habit right now where I learn Ruby on Rails everyday in the summer.  I'm spending easily 8 hours a day sitting behind my desk learning Rails.. well, 4 hours learning rails, and 4 hours being distracted.

Nothing wrong with that, it's a big part of learning. Something you have to do plenty even when you're pretty learned in a language.

Check for official tutorials and documentation first. Rust especially, for example, has a great 'getting started' introduction in their docs.

Apart from the fact that they are both languages that support OO they _really_  have very little in common - the way you design and write a Java program is very different from how you would do so in C++.;;

"LLVM is a sort of very low-level language, akin to bytecode or assembly. It's not something that a human will typically ever read or write -- it's intended to be generated by compilers (for example, Clang). (To broadly generalize, the compiler generates LLVM bytecode, and then another compiler will convert the LLVM into assembly. It turns out it's way easier to generate LLVM bytecode then it is to generate assembly, so writing a compiler that churns out LLVM is much easier then one that directly churns out assembly).

So, it doesn't really make sense to compare LLVM to GCC -- they're apples to oranges. Rather, a better comparison would be Clang (which uses LLVM) to GCC. Clang and GCC are both compilers.

From your perspective, and indeed from most people's perspectives, they're interchangable. They both can compile the same code, and will both generate an exe file you can run. 

Clang _does_ have a reputation for generating nicer error messages, but at the level you're currently at, I doubt that you'll run into complicated enough errors where this will come in handy.

Basically, it does not matter right now. Stick with whatever you were doing before, and use whatever compiler you're currently using. Don't worry about LLVM -- it's completely irrelevant at your current stage of learning.

";;
"thank you 
";;
"> Clang does have a reputation for generating nicer error messages, but at the level you're currently at, I doubt that you'll run into complicated enough errors where this will come in handy.

I completely disagree.  Clang puts out *much better* error messages for beginner mistakes.  It precisely points out (literally, with arrows) what you did wrong and often suggests the correct fix.  Error messages are worded in a more accessible manner for beginners as well.";;
Then you're probably right. It's been a while since I used either, and was mostly going off of memory.;;
"How do you mean 'get into it'? If you want to use Clang, the C++ compiler based on LLVM, do so. It's basically the same experience as using the GCC one. 

How the compiler is implemented shouldn't matter to you as a programmer while programming.";;
To a certain extent it depends what platform you are on - clang (the LLVM C++ compiler) support is still not great on Windows. That apart, it really doesn't matter, except that you are likely to find a larger range of tutorials for GCC than you are for clang.;;
If you're on Mac, I think Clang/LLVM is easier to use. GCC/MinGW-w64 is the way to go on Windows since Clang is slightly harder to setup.;;

As far as tech goes if you are using Ruby on Rails check out Capybara. It's a very popular web automation tool in the Ruby on Rails community. It has multiple back ends that can be swapped out fairly easily (Rack Test, Selenium, Poltergeist/PhantomJS). For a test framework I would recommend Cucumber if you are going to work on the tests and share them with other members of your team. That's especially true if you will be working on them with non technical users as it uses natural language test descriptions that are seperate from the implementation. However, if it's just you RSpec is a good choice and doesn't have the overhead of a seperate feature description and implementation. I find it's not as easy to quickly identify what you have and haven't covered with RSpec automation tests though. 

[The Cucumber Book by Matt Wynne and Aslak Hellesøy](https://pragprog.com/book/hwcuc/the-cucumber-book) gives a good intro to cucumber and even has a section on using it with Rails. 


For Python I'd just use either the built in unittest library or maybe nose tests. For actually automating the browser the most common choice is selenium.

For Python you can use 'assert' to ensure the results of method calls are as expected. You could make a script of these tests and set up a cron job for scheduling.;;

The official Python documentation is probably sufficient, at least it was for me.;;

- [Learn X in Y Minutes](http://learnxinyminutes.com/) -- covers the basics of syntax in a rapid, condensed guide.
- The [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) -- it moves fairly quickly/doesn't spend too long on the basics + is comprehensive + does a good job of conveying the nifty/useful pieces of Python. Also makes for a good reference guide.
- [Python Module of the Week](http://pymotw.com/) - gives loads of good information and examples for pretty much every module in the standard library (and usually does a better job then the official documentation). 
- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/) -- doesn't cover the language, but does cover best practices, info about the Python ecosystem, and gives a good overview of popular 3rd party libraries.

I would also try googling things like ""Python for X developers"" or ""moving from X to Python"", (where 'X' is the name of a language you know already).";;

If this hackathon is anything like the one I attended recently, you should definitely go. Our team had programmers and entrepreneurs.

They were asking who wanted to go, and I gave them my background, and they nominated me. But if they picked me, I guess they weren't super selective;;
Graphics design and experience with business? Yes please!;;
"Given that you have graphics design skills, I would tentatively say that you'd be a hot commodity + a potentially valuable contributor for that reason alone -- programmers are usually shit at art/design (try googling the term ""programmer art""). In my experience, a team that is able to nab an artist is usually at an advantage compared to other teams. The entrepreneurship experience might also be valuable as well given the theme of the competition (though it does depend a little on how the event is set up).

However, it really does depend from hackathon to hackathon. Some are really technically-focused, whereas others broader and try and include a mixture of people (technical, graphics, business, entrepreneurship, etc). It seems a little ambiguous in this case which it is. The theme of the hackathon suggests that they're looking for a broader range of people, but if they say they have a hard requirement that everybody must have a CS/CE/EE major, then that seems to contradict that.

I think your best bet is to just reach out and ask the summit organizers what the event is going to be like/if it's ok for you to go.

Typically, this kind of thing is done with a single-page JavaScript application and front-end route handling. React (with react-router) and AngularJS can both be used to make this possible through CSS, but it's not worth the effort, in my opinion.;;

I've used AngularJS for exactly this purpose before. Very easy to implement, definitely recommended.;;

"A gif file does not contain any code in it -- pretty much no image or video format does, as far as I know.

More specifically, a gif file is basically a series of images globbed together. That's it. It's like a slideshow where each frame goes by very quickly.

As a result, there's no way to make a gif programmatically show different things. The best you can do is probably to make a personal website, then grammatically have your website display a different gif randomly. ";;
"No, but it is encoded in binary. Would it be possible to add code into that?

"No.  Binary is irrelevant.  A computer would have no chance of working if random data could be given behavior all of a sudden.  The program that reads and displays a GIF only knows how to interpret the data with in a certain narrow way (i.e. a series of static images displayed one after another.)  You can't just add behavior to that from nothing.

"OK, got it.

I'm just shooting out ideas now. Basically the only way to do it would be to host the gif somewhere myself and have the HTML randomize the gif that is displayed on page load, then set it up so an href call from an external site would display the randomized one?";;
HTML isn't what you'd be using. More likely a back-end language (PHP, Python, etc) that picks the image to serve at random. Could also do it via JavaScript, but doing it on the server would make the most sense for what you seem to be trying to accomplish.;;
Well, currently I only know HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap 3, and learning Java and JavaScript for things like that, so that is what I was going with.;;
"> the gif somewhere myself and have the HTML randomize the gif that is displayed on page load, then set it up so an href call from an external site would display the randomized one?

No.

You would need a different *.gif* file for *each variant* that you want to display.

Once a .gif exists as a file, there is no direct programmatic way to manipulate it. (At least, there is no programmatic way to manipulate individual frames without affecting the whole file.)

It's basically like a *film reel*. Once the reel exists, there is no way that any single frame of the film can be altered without cutting it out and pasting a new one in. This can only be achieved with special tools. The same would apply to your gifs, but even worse, since gif is a compressed format.";;
"OK, how about an array containing multiple files that are not visible. When the image is called, a random position in the array is loaded to the location under the same file name. 

E.g. 1.gif, 2.gif, 3.gif are the options. A random one is called on load and is placed in the useThisOne.gif position so an external site would pull a different gif whenever it tried to access useThisOne.gif";;
This would be technically doable.;;
"Well, I'd really only need two and have it be like

 if randomPosition <= 9,999 
then use 1.gif

Ifelse
Use 2.gif

With a random number generated between 0 and 10,001 as randomPosition to set the odds.";;
"That should be doable with javascript. In that case, you wouldn't even need to transfer the file that should be used over so that it can be called under the same file name. JavaScript can select a different file name upon random conditions.

Unfortunately, I cannot help you with the Javascript part as I am not that versed in it.";;
No worries. Would I still be able to drop the link to it into imgur and have it randomized?;;
At simplest just make a website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Make two gifs with one being normal and the other with your desired ending. Put both images to your server next to the other files and make it so that it loads one of the two images randomly using your preferred ratio. No need to use any backend in something this simple.;;
See my reply to /u/desrtfx to know what my reasoning behind wanting to do this, I'm on mobile and don't want to type it back out.;;
"""Binary"" does not automatically mean ""code"". Ultimately, everything in a computer (text files, images, whatever) is encoded as binary, and it's up to the programs that read your file to interpret that binary as they wish. In the case of a text editor, it'll interpret your binary has text. For gifs, the binary is interpreted by the browser as a sequence of images. 

You can't change how gifs are interpreted unless you modify the source code for a web browser, causing it to interpret gifs differently, and it's very unlikely you're going to be able to convince anybody to let that happen.

> Edit: without any coding, how can you set certain images to display for certain delays, I.e. 200ms, 500ms, or even that one that is a ""real time"" .gif of the earth rotating that only advances a single frame per minute?

If you want to freeze/delay and show an image for a longer interval then a single frame, then you copy that image + display for multiple frames. Think of how a film reel would show the same image over an interval of time -- that's what a gif does.

(A gif is not a very intelligent file format -- there's a reason why they're so bulky/often lag).";;
"> Would it be possible to add code into that?

Think about on how many different devices, platforms, operating systems, etc. Gifs can be displayed. All of them would require different executable code unless there were some form of underlying ""virtual machine"" (similar to the JVM, or the VM of a browser) that would abstract the image from the hardware.";;
You could use a program that creates animated gifs...;;
But even using such, OP would need to produce a *different* gif for each variant they have as the gifs can not be changed on the fly, as OP wants to do.;;
"Yes, but for his more simple question you can just use a gif editor:

But that's cheating! I'd rather figure out some way around that to do it myself.;;
Why do that yourself?  How will gaining knowledge about the animated gif format help you?  I'm all for learning things, but this seems likely to be a waste of time.;;
Honestly? I like doing some things in the most convoluted way possible. Like a Rube Goldberg machine out of code.;;
Ok, I thought you had the goal of getting something done here.  If it's just to learn the gif format, go for it.;;

"> Edit: without any coding, how can you set certain images to display for certain delays, I.e. 200ms, 500ms, or even that one that is a ""real time"" .gif of the earth rotating that only advances a single frame per minute?

The animated GIF format allows each frame to specify a delay and disposition (replace the previous frame or overlay the previous frame).

"GIF is just an image format - it cannot contain executable code. No image hosting website is going to let you upload arbitrary code to their server. You would not want this capability - then people could just upload malware to imgur.

The only way this could be accomplished is through some sort of exploit, targeting either imgur's server, or the code that loads the GIF. Even if you found such an exploit, you probably shouldn't use it.";;
"Darn. I was hoping if you uploaded a gif to imgur by a direct link it would work just pull it from the link rather than host it internally whenever it was viewed. 

So any ideas of how I could submit something like that without venturing into black hat territory?";;
You just can't. Imgur isn't designed for that. You will need to host it somewhere that's meant for hosting web pages. I don't know why you're so determined to host on imgur. Imgur is for hosting images, it will not host your code. You don't neccessarily need server-side scripting support, but remember if you put the code on the client side, everybody can read it. I don't know of a free hosting service that will allow server side scripting. If you don't expect much traffic, you could always host it on your desktop.;;
"Because it would get me to the front page and I'd be rolling in those sweet sweet fake internet points? This originally started out as as a shower thought, like ""huh, I bet I can make it to the front page and possibly start another #teamtoaster event if I could get a gif to show random people different things!"" I was there when Banana for scale started, when Connor made his first appearance, when shoulder chicken exploded, and when @kylecorn became famous. I thought something like this would propel me into the Imgur glorious pantheon. 

";;
But why does it need to be on imgur? You can link to other sites on reddit - including your own;;
Because I emigrated here from imgur. I still spend a lot of time on it and have never gotten to the fp. I know it's not possible this way, it would just have been cool to start something new.;;
"Server side scripts can serve an image. You could host it on your server, and have requests for image files redirected to your script. The file extension is often trusted to reflect the file type, but actually it doesn't matter - you can have a link that says .gif go to a server side script that would serve a random gif each time, and there'd be no way to tell from the client side that it's not a static image file. The only thing is, *you can't do this on imgur*. You can still do it, you just have to have your own server so you can configure it to do this. You can then post the link to reddit - there's no requirement that images need to be on imgur.

If you really wanted you could get a domain name and then create an ""imgur"" subdomain under it, and then hope that people don't notice that imgur.mysite.com isn't an imgur domain.


Also remember that getting a popular post on reddit is as much about luck as anything else. Often a post does very poorly, then gets reposted a few months later and reaches the front page. Even if you do this I wouldn't count on it becoming popular.";;
Yeah, I know how low the odds are, it would just be cool, especially after all of the kokum ones recently. Thanks for the advice.;;
"From a ""what can it do"" perspective, it's best to just assume a gif is like a mini-video file.  Like video files (e.g. .avi, .wmv, etc), gifs cannot do dynamic things.  It always shows you the same sequence of images (and a video is essentially that - a sequence of images).";;
How does one give rise to an image format without programming? ;;
"Programming does not necessarily mean that the image format can contain executable code.

  so, an empty string is returned. Calling `Integer.parseInt("")` obviously results in a `NumberFormatException`.

Your current code should work if you change all the elements to atributes but, you're better off changing your code than your XML.

Instead of `getAttribute(String name)` you need to use `getElementsByTagName(String name)`. Retrieving the data from the `score` element now looks like this:

    NodeList scoreNodeList= eElement.getElementsByTagName(""score"");
    Node scoreNode = scoreNodeList.item(0);
    score = Integer.parseInt(scoreNode.getTextContents);

This snippet should be easy to adapt for all your elements.

"Excellent reply!

Did you see OP's edit from about 55 minutes ago? Obviously they have solved it:

"Thanks for that snippet.

Was looking for a way to access them, it was very useful :D";;
You can replace the switch/case by converting the string to an int, decrementing, and indexing the array (after checking it's in bounds);;
"The first thing I'd do to improve this is to convert the input to an int like this:

Convert.ToInt32(input);

That will allow you to replace the whole Switch statement with one line:

Console.WriteLine(gifts[input-1]);";;
oops! Sorry, the previous comment saying this didn't load for some reason, so I didn't see it!;;
"Another improvement you could make would be to replace:

if (input == ""ALL"" || input == ""all"")

With:

if (input.ToLower() == ""all"")

This will ensure you catch all upper and lower case possibilities";;
Or use .Equals(OrdinalIgnoreCase) as == should not be used to compare strings.;;
"Using most JSON parsers in Java (including Gson) is a two-step process.

First, what you need to do is create a Java class that represents your JSON object. In your case, you'd need two classes -- the first will look something like:

    public class Foo {
        public Bar temptex;
        // ...
    }

And then the second like:

    public class Bar {
        public long id;
        public String name;
        public int profileIconId;
        // etc...
    }

(You'll probably want to come up with better names then `Foo` and `Bar`, and will also probably want to make your fields private + use getters and setters, unless you're feeling lazy)

Then, you call the `fromJson` method, and do this:

    import com.google.gson.Gson;

    // ...

    Gson gson = new Gson();
    Bar myObj = gson.fromJson(myString, Bar.class);

...and then the `fromJson` method will instantiate and populate your `Bar` object based on the contents of the JSON string you provide it.

(Every single object in Java has a `.class` attribute which returns an object of type `Class<YourObject>` which can be used for meta-programming related things)";;
"Is it a two step process because their is essentially 2 objects? 

""temptex"" > key for object

the rest > value for other key/values?

If my understanding is correct then I understand what you've provided.";;
"By two step classes, I meant that you need to first declare your classes and then call the method. You're going to follow the same process no matter how many classes you need, so the number of classes doesn't particularly matter here.

> ""temptex"" > key for object

""temptex"" is a key for the inner object, yes, but it's also important to note that it's inside an object as well. (It's somewhat annoying that we need to create an entirely separate class for that, but oh well).

> the rest > value for other key/values?

That sounds about right.";;
"ah right got it!

Thanks a lot!";;
"The syntax might seems a little confusing at first but, it's quite simple. You can retrive and instance of the `Class` class for a class by calling `ClassName.class`. Sounds confusing when put like that but all it means is that to get an instance of the `Class` class for `String` you call `String.class`.

I wrote a small test class to demonstrate this. 

    public class ClassTest {
        public static void main(String[] args){
            ClassTest.classTest(ClassTest.class);
            ClassTest.classTest(Math.class);
            ClassTest.classTest(String.class);
            ClassTest.classTest(Void.class);
        }
        
        public static <T> void classTest(Class<T> clazz){
            System.out.println(clazz);
        }
    }

Output:


    class ClassTest
    class java.lang.Math
    class java.lang.String
    class java.lang.Void

But then your command line application isnt a good one, as you can't pipe out of it into another program;;
"This is a design question then.

For such simple programs, piping should not be a concern, and AFAIK there is no other option in Windows to keep a command window open (when the program is started from the GUI) than to make it wait for a key.";;

The command line is a big trade secret for most people.";;
"Yes users are stupid, problem exists between keyboard and chair.

This shouldn't change the way you write console applications, they will learn when they see it disappear a few times and google it.";;
"In this case I have to disagree.

As learning experience in the beginning it is perfectly legitimate to write code that wouldn't be used in real environments.

There still are *plenty* commercial command-line tools that require keypresses to exit the programs.

Piping is not as big a thing in Windows as it is in *nix operating systems. Only the rise of Powershell has really brought piping to Windows.

Basically the only pipes that existed in DOS were `more` and `find`.";;
"What? you should definetly program to fit the user. What are you even talking about.

"I personally don't think so. While many people say that Lynda and Tusplus are high quality, I've been more then satisfied with the ludicrous amount of free resources available online. (there are also usually pirated copies of most high-quality programming books floating around, if you're in to that sort of thing).

That said, I've always preferred self-learning, and have always strongly preferred text over video (I can set my own pace when reading + can go 5 times faster or 5 times slower as needed). As a result, I have no idea what the quality of video tutorials are like available online -- it doesn't seem like there's a systemic way to find reviews, like you can with books, and no easy way to skim + assess the quality like you can with text tutorials.";;
"I'm using TeamTreehouse and I really like it. It might not be for everyone and I don't think it's something you should have for an extended period of time (I'm deactivating as soon as I'm done with their android course.)

I prefer videos, I've watched a ton from multiple sources and the treehouse ones are the best I've encountered by far. The support is pretty good too. It helped me give my studies some structure, it's a linear path. And at the beginning, when I wasn't quite sure what to do, trying multiple programming languages on the site helped me figure out what I liked the most.";;
"I sort of deviated from your question, the quick answer is you can use Invoke and be able to gain access to the UI thread. This is very bad practice though.

---

Windows forms are a bit tricky when dealing with threads. Form methods can only be called by the thread that created them. (There are ways around this, but you shouldn't need to do this.) The reason for limiting calls directly on form methods is that most of them “freeze” the ui thread to perform the call. If enough calls are made this becomes very obvious as the UI starts lagging and becomes unresponsive.

The way to go about this is having a copy of all the UI information you regularly need on hand outside of the UI thread. This ties into the Model-View-Controller program structure. 

Short description of MVC - The View is the section containing all the Forms and handles ui stuff. The Model stores data. (Such as storing an isVisable flag) The Controller acts as an interface between the model and view. The majority of controller methods should have ""request,"" ""get,"" or ""set"" in their name. Your main program then only needs to interact with the model instead of dealing with UI threads and all that.

When a ui component is changed the View component should call a request method in the controller component. This method then changes the matching data in the model.  

            //Method inside of the Window form’s code
           Private void m_txtBox_Name1_ValueChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
           {
                 m_formControllerOne.requestChangeInName1Value(m_txtBox_Name1.Value);
           }
  
The request change method would then update the model’s copy of the data. Then any other programs/methods/threads only has to interact with the model and not bother the timing critical UI thread. The model is significantly easier to pass around if needed as well, although you should be using get/set methods to access the model.

"Hello, 

Yes, bootstrap is incredibly daunting to start, given the jpeg this is the approach I would use;

    <div class=""container"">
    	<div class=""row"">
    		<div class=""col-md-3"">Logo</div>
    		<div class=""col-md-2 col-md-offset-1"">Tel</div>
    		<div class=""col-md-6"">
    			<ul class=""list-inline"">

    				<li><!-- div in here which contains the link element --></li>			
    			</ul>	
    		</div>
    	</div>
    </div>

To explain;

The container keeps all the content centred. 

The first col is col-md-3, which has the logo

The second for the telephone is col-md-2 with a col-md-offset-1 

The offset pulls the column to the right by one column, essentially putting a 1 column gap between the first and the second, that takes care of the spacing. 

The final column comprises the remaining column space (the first 2 columns add up to 6, therefore the last column is col-md-6)

Inside that there is a list with the class ""list-inline"" which removes the list style with the bullet and makes the elements stack from left to right. You can put div's inside of the list elements which represent the links.

Hope this helps.

"You can learn both if you want to. Learn Java for android and replace python/ruby with Java in making web apps. Of course in that path you also need HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

"PhoneGap is fine but of course going native will always be better. Best about these are the ability to use with the web tools (this assumes you know html, css and js and dont want to learn java) and that it supports all major platforms.

Disadvantages are that if you continuously create apps using phonegap, they will charge you monthly. Another is the performance, it will be lower than in native apps and might impact you depending on what you are doing. Also not all functionality is supported.

That said, react native is better and that for android might touch on some of these issues but it might not.";;

"Many programming languages can put data into an excel sheet if you use their corresponding libraries. 

VBA is a bit different, since you actually program an excel document to do stuff instead of program an application to use excel (in very basic terms).

Honestly, it would help if you told us a bit more about what exactly you are trying to do. For example, you said ""I'm making this GUI"". Which language/framework are you using to do so? It is highly likely that you can use that language to store your data into an Excel sheet.";;

Chances are you'll have people on here debating the benefitsegatives of PHP vs Python, Postgres vs TSQL, if that API is better than this API.

We're nerds, and arguing incessantly over pedantic minor details is what we do best. But if you get caught up in wanting to know what the ""best"" API is to use, or if you should use this or that algorithm at this stage of your project, on the scale you'll be making it, you'll never fucking make the damn project.

Trust me. Over a month ago I set out to remake an old project, but newer and better, with all the lessons I learnt from the last one (funnily enough similar to the idea you've got). But then I began looking into changing the language from PHP to python. And that meant looking into python web frameworks, and then that meant looking at compatibility between django and the various DB's I was thinking about. Yada yada yada.

Number of lines of code written? 0. Zilch. Nada. Nothing. Zip.

In the time it's taken me to kinda sorta get an idea of what I want to use to create my masterpiece, I could've easily written a full, though ugly, prototype. I know because I did. The project was my University project, and due to things out of my control, I did have a fully functioning prototype after only a month.

Sure, it's gonna be a bitch to remake everything once you've got that prototype up and running, and halfway through you're gonna want to kill someone because you just want to be able to go back to the old language, which was ugly and slow but at least it worked, or the old API which was confusing and hard to use, but at least didn't require ten lines of code just to connect to the DB.

You're most experienced with C++? Fuck it, make a website using C++. It's unconventional sure. But at the end of the day you'll have a working website, whereas you're friend's still figuring out how to make a variable in Ruby, even though it's sooooo much better and can totally all these cool things that he's just got to figure out.

Here's my advice to you: You're looking to make an App and a website, correct? And you already know Python. Well fuckin shit you're halfway there. Learn the core HTML basics (HTML/CSS/JavaScript), and you're basically done. Hell a lot of apps nowadays are just basically web frontends with dedicated resources, making the same calls that a website does.

On memory, both Google and Apple provide a good API out of the box with their Dev kits, that should get you all you'll need to build a working prototype.

Make your server contain all the code you need, and your DB. You can migrate and duplicate and load balance this shit once you can click on shit and it does shit. Before then? Trust me, your wasting money and time, and fucking yourself over if you decide to call it quits.

When you click on the ""Profile"" button in the app and the website, they both call the exact same thing, ""profile.py"", to get the data you need from the server. If you really want have ""profile.app.py"" and ""profile.web.py"", but realistically, you should be sorting out how to display the data on the front end. But, then again, pedantry, make the app and site work first, even if only enough to show off to your friends.

There's obviously, a major gap between the high level design I've just given you, and the actual implementation, but at it's core, that's a functioning site/app. You've now got a prototype to improve on. You no longer have to worry about ""my-cool-site.com/my-cool-exercise-plan.html"" not existing. ""my-cool-app's"" profile section actually displays profiles. Sure, you can't register, or even really log in since you don't check passwords. But hey, you can whip out your phone at the next party to show off your cool new app that's gonna take the world by storm.";;
"Great reply! Really inspiring actually. This is kind of the attitude that lead me to asking this question. I was trying to learn everything and  actually building nothing. 

I really appreciate you taking the time to write that out! Time to start hacking away at this...";;
There are two ways: try something new or stick to what You know. ;;
"It's great that you have an idea you're invested in. First off, I'm wondering - are you writing this to learn about web programming and APIs or do you actually want to sell a product? Both is okay :)

Python is a good language for something like this. I'll start with the website and backend. I'm not sure how much you know about this stuff, let me know if you want me to clarify something. I highly recommend http://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world this tutorial - which will go over most of the things in this post, plus some more. As to the Google App Engine, you won't be deploying for a while, but when you get there, I would go with Heroku (or your own VPS).

So first, you have to store the data somewhere - let's use sqlite (you can also use postgresql). You'll need to learn basic SQL/creating databases to begin creating your schemas. For example, a lifting workout might contain fields for ""type"", ""reps"", ""sets"", ""weight"", (can you tell I don't know anything about exercise yet?). SQLAlchemy is a cool library to let you think about these relationships in an object oriented way (instead of SQL) - it does a lot of magic behind the scenes, so you won't really be learning much SQL - if that matters to you at all.

Then, you need a server so people can ask it for their data. Flask is excellent, Django is also good. As a beginner, Flask would probably be better. You can use an extension like Flask-RESTful to start building your API once you have models. (If you don't know about RESTful APIs, you should read up on it). This will expose your data from your datastore through HTTP requests. For example, your API  might let someone get a list of all your users by going to `http://api.yoursite.com/users`. In Flask you should also create views for your homepage, login page, etc.

Which brings us to the frontend - HTML, CSS, JavaScript. If you're not into rolling your own design, I would use Bootstrap or Foundation and tweak it to your liking. On the JavaScript side - things might get a little complicated. Normally, I would suggest just using jQuery for your first app, then moving onto  frameworks (Angular, Backbone, etc.) later. But your project is pretty ambitious, and doing it with straight jQuery will leave everything all over the place. Maybe you should try writing a small part with just jQuery and then moving onto a framework-of-your-choice once you get more comfortable with JavaScript/the DOM. Your JavaScript will be making HTTP requests using AJAX (so the page doesn't reload) to give your users data.

Mobile - I know there are programs like Cordova that'll let you design a mobile app for any platform with HTML/CSS/jQuery. You could also build it natively. In any case, same principle - frontend in whatever platform, and calling the backend through HTTP requests to get data.

"Well of course if you pick a boring example you won't see much much difference.  Here's an example pulled at random from binutils:

    /* Build a Binary Search Tree to sort sections, unlike insertion sort

       of sections are large.  */

Return types can get very long, particularly when they are custom types or function pointer types, and there are modifiers like `static` or `__attribute__` in the mix.  You run into line length issues very fast, which means you have to pick where to break the line, and always breaking the line so that the name of the function begins in column 1 makes things more consistent.

- Because you probably want to commit multiple files at the same time, you add gradually the files that need to be checked in. It is also error prone: you can look at the 'diff' in the staging area only and make sure nothing is missing, and nothing is there and shouldn't be.  

&nbsp;

Why would you stage something if it's not ready to be committed?  
- Same as I previous answer: staging area is kind of a ""eligible to be committed"" until you gather properly all the files that need to be committed.  

&nbsp;

Is there a way to use add then realize you've made a mistake and undo your add?  
- Sure, git even tells you how. If you type 'git status' and you have files in stage, git shows you how to unstage (git reset HEAD <file>.."")  
  
&nbsp;
  
I'd like to understand git push a bit more as well.  
- To make it simple: you **commit** to your **local branch**. There, you have total control: you can undo commits, merge commits together, split commits into multiple ones, etc. Once you're ready with all your local commits, then you can **push** them to the **remote branch**, where they will be visible to the rest of the world. Once that is done, and those commits are now public, they should not be touched anymore (in theory) because then they will mess up the history and probably break everyone's branches.  
  
&nbsp;
  
I really recommend you read (at least) the first 4 chapters of the git book available here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2. It's really easy to read and it's fairly small and simple (can be read in a couple of hours). I also suggest you create a dummy repo on github and play around with it (and break it, of course, to really understand what is happening).  
  
&nbsp;
  
EDIT: Formatting  ";;
hey thanks so much for your response i learned a lot and will have a look at the book you've suggested. I've been playing with git and a repo on github this is why im having these questions I know what im supposed to do but im trying to understand the why im doing it side of things a bit more. You've even enlightened me to things that I now how more questions to. Like why in the hell would you want to split a commit. Would you split a commit in order to undo a mistaken merge? I'm assuming that's the only thing that would be useful for.;;
"A commit should represent one logical change — fixing one bug, adding one feature, and so on.  This makes life easier in the future.  For example when you want to bisect a bug to determine the commit that introduced a regression, you will hate yourself if you lumped a bunch of unrelated stuff into one commit.

It's common to use temporary commits to save your work in progress.  For example, maybe you've hacked away at stuff but it's time to go home and you're not at a point that you'd consider a good stopping point.  You use `git stash` or make a quick WIP (work in progress) commit, perhaps on a temporary branch.  This kind of commit is not expected to be pretty, i.e. it won't have a meaningful commit message and it will contain all kinds of garbage that you may not want actually as part of the history.

Once you pick back up where you left off, and you've gotten things into a proper state, you're going to want to clean things up.  Let's suppose you use the 'amend' feature to rewrite that WIP commit into something with a proper commit message, and that doesn't contain junk.  Maybe that's where you leave it.  But maybe you decide that this should not be all one commit and that you want to split it up.  Git gives you lots of powerful ways of dealing with these kind of scenarios.
";;
"The book will certainly make things clearer. To answer your question, you can split a commit in case you realize that it is too big a change, and would make more sense as two separate ones. This also helps/impacts the development practices:  
1. You want to add a new feature to a software  
2. You fork a new branch which will be dedicated to that feature  
3. You make your changes. And as you go, you make mistakes, you find bugs, better ways to do things, optimize others, etc. You have the freedom to play around with your commits as much as you want since they're still local until the commit history for that feature is clean  
4. Once you're happy with the commits, you rebase onto another branch  
5. You push that branch, and now your feature is available to the world  
  
&nbsp;

As you can see this obviously leads to a better history and code base, cleaner logs, etc.";;
"I don't think you ever *have* to add anything without committing it (there's no point in adding it if it is never committed, as far as I'm aware), but we're human. We do things bit by bit, in stages, and by trial and error.

...So, I may make a new IFoo interface and add that, and then I may make three or four new classes implementing that interface and add those, but from the point of view of someone looking at my commit, I was cool and did it all at once. /flex :P

Yes, you can un-add something. I end up doing that constantly because for some reason I haven't deactivated vim's swap files. -.-

You only push to other repositories. Like, main or whatever. It's already committed to your local repository.

It isn't necessary for you to push to remote before merging locally because all your merging is just that: local. If I checkout the June work branch of my project and then branch off of that for some bug fix, I can merge straight into June, or I can push my new branch to the remote so that I can create a pull request. Doesn't really matter much which option I pick as long as Chuck isn't watching too closely.";;
adding still makes zero sense to me as to why it exists. If you just save your files there doesnt seem to be a need to add them one by one as you go but rather add them all at the end and commit, but perhaps add is a way for it to know which files have changed and therefore more optimal when committing so that it knows exactly which files have changed and which ones have changed that you might not want commited since you didn't add it. I guess i sorta just answered my own question but it took your post to enlighten me of this so thanks.;;
"
>adding still makes zero sense to me as to why it exists.

I use it when I have, for example, five files modified but I only want to commit three of them. I can add them one by one, double check, and then commit. ";;
The main thing is that you can NOT add a file, and it will then NOT be included in the commit.;;
"> I'd like to understand git push a bit more as well, what are you pushing to if not a repo. 

When you clone a repository, you now have your own local repository.  Git is distributed, which means that there is not a privileged ""central"" copy.  The cloned repository contains an entire copy of everything from the repository it was cloned from.  And a repository is nothing more than some files on disk, there is no server required.

Suppose you:

- clone a repository, which implicitly creates a working copy from the tip of the default branch
- edit some files
- test the change
- convince yourself the change is proper
- add the changed files to the staging area
- verify that the diff looks like what you want (doesn't contain extraneous things that shouldn't be there)
- and then finally commit

You've added a new commit to your local repository.  Someone who had ssh access to your machine could clone your repository, and that clone would include that commit.  Someone with ssh access to your machine who already had an existing clone could pull or fetch(*) from your repository to their repository, copying that commit and keeping the two repositories in sync.  Or if you have ssh access to some remote repository, you can push that commit from your local repository to the remote repository.  Github is just a service that hosts repositories on your behalf, giving you ssh access to be able to push to those repositories.  But the inherent nature of how it works is not dependent on Github at all.

(*) pull is really just fetch+merge.  fetch alone adds commits to the repository but does not affect the current branch.  pull does that and also tries to merge the changes into the current branch.";;
"Others here have given great examples of why you `add` files before you commit and how that can help you manage what changes go into a commit. This is very much the developer's view and it is assuredly a valid perspective (it is, after all, *your* perspective!). I'm going to talk about it from git's perspective.

**What is 'adding', anyway?**

When you say `git add FILE` you are adding (more often called ""staging"") the file into Git's index. The index is the most important thing for Git. It is what keeps track of every change^1 of every file you will eventually commit. Without the index, there is no Git! Hence, passing through the index is *required*.

**The working tree**

The other important component that you as a developer directly interact with is the working tree (sometimes called the working directory). The working tree is where, well, you do all of your work! There are three different kinds of files in the working tree: untracked, unmodified, and modified. Untracked files are files that are present in the directory, but Git has no record of that file's history. This can happen because you just added a new file (e.g., you added a new class source file to your project) or because you did a build and there are lots of object files lying about (see gitignore to learn about excluding these from your repo). If you want to start tracking the changes to a file, you have to add it to the index. Unmodified files are those that git has a history for, but you haven't made any changes to. Modified files are the ones that Git has a history for and you have made changes to. The modified files are the ones that you want to add to the index^2. When you are working on multiple branches simultaneously, `git stash` allows you to save your working tree without requiring you to add all of your changed files to the index.

**The `status` of your repo**

`git status` is the easiest way to keep track of what files you have changed. It shows you the untracked, modified, and staged files. You will find yourself using it quite a bit.

I think that should get you started. The online book that /u/kernelhoops recommended is a great place to get started. I found the [O'Reilly Git](http://www.amazon.com/Version-Control-Git-collaborative-development/dp/1449316387/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1435833315&sr=1-1&keywords=O%27Reilly+git) book to be both comprehensive and readable (a rare combination!) which makes it great for learning and as a reference text.


[1] Git doesn't keep track of individual changes, it makes snapshots. This is a technical detail, but it is what separates git from previous version control systems although it is not the only one that uses this mechanism.

[2] To see which files have been modified, you can use `git ls-files -m`.";;

Programming isn't remembering, it's problem solving.   If you forget the parameters to some function and have to look it up,  that's not failing to be a programmer.

Thanks for the feedback. I realize that the beauty of programming is the ability to have Google in your back pocket. I just worry that so much of programming is structural and a poor memory will make me hopeless.";;
I think that you'll have a lot of barriers.  It's about remembering complicated constructs that have specific behaviors and knowing how those constructs interact with each other.  Being mindful of those things might be necessary to get the job done.  I don't think you'll have much trouble starting out, as it is a skill, not a dictionary reading competition.  Try to learn a strongly-typed language. If you can remember the names of the types and objects that you work with, it might be okay. ;;
Thank you for your help and response. I agree that I think I'll have some limitations because even though programming isn't all memory or information recollection there are many aspects that require a strong memory.;;
Sure thing. Is it just putting a name to things that gives you trouble?  If so, you will likely do fine (unless you just hate programming).  There are so many tools to help you remember the names of things.  Visual Studio (a program that helps you program) will go as far as producing a list of all the things you could possibly mean in a particular point.;;
I'm not sure how best to articulate the memory issues I experience. It's mostly just losing information that I don't use frequently. I realize that sounds normal but it's a bit more aggressive than the average person. ;;

"This is an ideal opportunity to use some bash! Bash is a programming language that is also a way of interacting with the terminal (or a way to interact with the terminal that's also a programming language, it works both ways) and it has some surprising power. 

Let's look at an example that accomplishes part of what you're interested in, and then we can get more in depth. 

With bash, you have the option of creating ""scripts"" that execute a sequence of bash commands. For example, if you want to be able to curl the same URL with a different header depending on user input, the following single-line script will work:

    curl localhost:8000 -Ivs -H ""X-First-Name: $1"" 

I've put in some extra output so that we can see what happens. 

To set this up, create a new file. I called mine ""curl-example"" but you can use whatever name you want. Then, copy-paste the code above exactly as written. Then, from the terminal, run 

    chmod +x curl-example

which will mark the text file as an executable, which will (in this case) be executed as bash. Then, run the file with 

    ./curl-example Joe

and it will run the curl command with Joe substituted in where ""$1""
appears. 

I'm happy to talk more about this, and there are plenty of resources on the internet for ""bash scripting"" and related topics. 

Hope this helps!

"I have found that the more I learn one, the easier the others become. Take for example if you learn a foreign language that is Latin based like Spanish. After learning Spanish you start to find you can understand Porteguese, French, Italian, etc. Now I'm not saying you will be perfectly fluent in these languages by no means, but you could probably pick up a book or listen to a conversation and be able to at least get the gist. Then if you decided to learn it, you'd find it easier than someone who is starting from scratch.

The same with coding. The more I learn about C++ and use it, the easier it is to understand other languages!! For instance Java, C# and Python aren't much of a hassle. Of course I have to look things up and syntax is different, but you get the point. Now, I don't know if that is a common experience, but I don't see how it couldn't be.

If you decide to continue with C++ (which is a VERY good base in my opinion) I would recommend this tutorial done by Luka Horvat - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoWVE5cwmP8

He goes through the entire process, starting at the setup and getting everything configured. He does mention you should know C++ before commencing, the goal of his guide isn't to teach you basic C++ language, but more of how to use what you know.

Now the game you create is a simple Block Breaker game (with the bouncing ball that you have to keep from going off the bottom of the screen). But after doing that, you will have the basics for any other sort of game.

>Compilers are super important. The number of problems you want to solve that reduce down to the principles you will learn in a compilers course is staggering.

Compilers are important, but I don't think that learning compiler design is a core requirement in a CS education.

Compiler design is great because it applies a ton of the knowledge you learned in your core classes.  You are able to see how the foundation you have built in your intro/intermediate classes can be used to create something as complex as a compiler.";;

See slides 3-5 for some super high level, qualitative reasons that Stanford thinks compiler study is essential if you want to mature as a developer.


Beyond that, think about the steps one goes through when compiling. You must understand how to parse incoming data and build up a data structure that makes that data easy and efficient to work with, transform it in some useful way, under difficult constraints and while preserving its meaning, and then output it in a potentially wildly different format. It's how huge swaths of software is expected to behave. However, unlike most ill-specified problems you'll work on, compilers have a huge body of literature and decades of continuous, academic and industrial research behind their design.  The techniques used to implement them efficiently and in a maintainable way are well explored and valuable.

Why are those core CS courses?;;
"At the most fundamental level of CS is understanding how to talk to computers and understanding how they work. 

IMHO, I think these courses are helpful in being able to solve problems.

Automata theory studies the abstract idea of machine models and what they are capable of solving in how much time. IMO we, more or less, have two kinds of models we use today to program computers. This studies the abstract of solving problems on any machine. Practice may be in solving and programming finite state machines, useful in many practical applications.

Programming language theory deal with the abstract of the strengths and weaknesses of particular programming languages. Part of this class might be spent practicing functional programming languages, for example.

Compilers. IMO, you better have some knowledge of compilers because we use them every day.


All of these add up to being better at solving problems and knowing what programming language provide or don't provide you.";;
I totally get that. My point was that many top institutions don't even require these as 'core' classes.;;
The latter two are now accounted for in the list;;
"If you're out of school, and already a programmer, do you really need to ""learn"" those topics on your own?";;
The issue with that is that is that it increases your unknown unknowns.  If you get a problem that you should use a finite state machine to solve, you're unlikely to randomly guess that you should look into finite state machines.  This is why 'just-in-time' learning is problematic in the long run.;;
I'm an EE who's been trying to teach myself some CS stuff for a little while now, and I'm constantly running into this problem. Something I think would help people like me is a very broad, surface-level course that basically surveys the field rather then delving into each topic. That way, I could get an understanding of what topics and knowledge exist in the field and what's necessary to be a competent computer scientist, but could dive into each topic at my own pace (or when I need to solving problems). ;;
"There are varying opinions on the Udacity programs (a lot of people recently got very grumpy while I was doing the Intro to Programming course because they deleted their old forums and all of the very useful information within them) but I definitely can vouch for it for this purpose.

Do the cs50 course from HarvardX. The lectures are actually entertaining to watch (unlike most moocs) and the problem sets are challenging. If you finish you'll have an excellent base knowledge and can choose the other courses as you see fit. ;;
"What's missing from a standard US university CS degree is a collection of math requirements and some kind of elective science requirement.

This includes at any level of interest (e.g. from 1/2 a semester up to two semesters, depending on how flexible the university is with math reqs):

* Pre calculus: Trig and algebra.
* Calculus: Differentiation, Integration on 2D and 3D surfaces, and Vectors and vector calculus.
* Linear algebra
* Differential equations
* Probability and stats
* Graph theory
* Control theory
* Physics xor Chemistry xor Biology (Introductory courses, one or two terms)

Also fun, but not mandatory:

* Introduction to electrical engineering
* Courses involved with designing and implementing on FPGAs or asynchs.
* Intro to technical writing


UX Design, Mobile Dev, Database systems, and Intro to web dev are optional courses one might take leading them on a track to graduation. At a university, one might take courses in the following fields, as they seem more interesting, setting them on a ""track"" to graduation:  

* AI
* Compilers
* Distributed and Parallel Processing
* Graphics and Data visualization
* Human Computer Interaction
* Networks
* Robotics
* Security
* Video Games

Then there are all sorts of fun things you can take that might help in these fields:  

* Art, e.g. computer art
* Economics, e.g. game theory
* Ethics, e.g. ethics in science
* Film and digital media
* Linguistics
* Music, e.g. electronic sound synthesizing
* Theater: Digital media";;
"Graph Theory is almost always a part of Discrete Math courses (listed already) and Probability & Statistics is also usually briefly covered in a Discrete Math course (CS 70 which is listed on the page covers both of these topics)

He also mentioned that he's not going to include liberal art courses, which makes sense because there are so many.

Agree with the rest though";;
Came here to say this. Computer *science* is not just about programming.;;
I have a trello compiled of becoming a full stack JavaScript developer. I would love to share it with you. I am a CS student at a university right now, and although the courses you have are great, you actually have to learn to develop, and JavaScript is a pretty easy language for it. Much easier then C, in my opinion.;;
For full stack JavaScript development, I suggest you check out freecodecamp.com;;
I've had been there for a while. However, as much as it attempts, it does not offer everything. ;;
I actually want to hear more about what it doesn't, so I can cover the gaps.;;
Sure, I can share my trello board with you, send me your email. ;;
"Got it, thanks! 

Is it meant to be used starting from the far left column and cover everything that I'm not familiar with?";;
Yeah, I had a conversation with one of the founders of freecode camp, and he said this (from left to right) is about the order you should learn full stack. ;;
"Got it, thanks!

By the way, I think the board is public, but only added members can edit it. https://trello.com/b/uCmYufWJ/javascript-extra-curriculum

It's also missing some command line parts or are they covered with the git section?";;
Since this is a work in progress board, I don't like the way trello is treating it where people cannot edit stuff. ;;
Please elaborate !;;
Well, even the brilliant people who are working very hard on improving the freecodecamp have their own lists of supplemental studies. I'm sorry, but with technology there is no way you can learn it all by never googling, never using multiple resources. ;;
Interested how far in you are?;;
I have 2 years left in my degree. And I am halfway through bonfires. ;;
Cool... I am just starting my ziplines.;;
Def. Still learning more and more, it feels like I am getting a relatively complete package;;
"Can you define a ""stack""  for me? I have 2 computer related degrees and still don't understand :(. ";;
"Stack: Very basically, the list of technology people use for a task.

[Note: this video put everything in perspective for me very well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5qpS_D8Law)

Stack typically means the following categories:

- OS hosting the web server
- The web server
- Database
- Back-end scripting

Here is a list of common [solution stacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solution_stack).  Like the one I'm most familiar with is LAMP, which includes Linux (OS), Apache (web server), MySQL (DB), Python (Scripting).  Note this is all backend. 

When someone says ""full-stack"", they're typically talking about the front end scripting and the back-end scripting.  The frontend scripting almost always means Javascript (*not* the same as Java).  Back-end scripts that I'm familiar with are things like C#.net, Python, VB.net, Perl, PHP (?), and node.js.

Basically, when you type in a web address, your browser sends that url to some server somewhere, and that server reads that url, then sends a web page back to your browser, then your browser prints it.  The ""back-end"" scripting is the programming that the server uses to decide which web page to send back, and the ""front-end"" scripting is some of the neat stuff your browser is doing to make the web page function differently.


Other components sometimes meant by the question, ""Whats your stack?"", are things like:

- Framework used in the back-end scripting (such as Flask with Python, .net with C#, node.js with Javascript)
- Framework used for frontend stuff (such as Angular.js for Javascript, JQuerry for Javascript, Bootstrap for CSS).  Note: Where the back-end scripting is often one scripting language for a given project, the frontend work can feature several frameworks and things, even for the same piece (pieces are Javascript/CSS/HTML).
- Text Editor, and plugins
- Hardware
- Virtualization setup
- Networking setup
- Sysadmin setup

The problem is that stack is used in several different places in computing.  It's also used for a call stack, and has an overflow state when full, which I presume is where the popular website [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) gets the name.

And even when it means something straight forward like the ""tech stack"" or ""solution stack"", people often want to know only about specific pieces.  It's going to depend largely on context what it means.  If you look at this [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack) list, you'll notice there are several uses pages for stacks under Computers alone.

Hope that helps.";;
I thought that P in LAMP was for PHP;;
"I thought it was for PERL, but it's a P, and Python begins with P too.

The final P in LAMPP was for PHP I believe.";;
So it's PHP and alternatives. the more you know :);;
Please don't capitalize Perl.;;
Oops, it was unintentional, but then again I am an old COBOL fossil, and old habits die hard.;;
Thanks! This comment really helped lay it all out concisely.;;
A stack is all the layers of technology used to make an application. So for web development, it's gonna be system administration all the way up to front-end development, and everything in between.;;
Oh makes sense.  So stacks are just relative to what one is talking about.  A al,  osi staxk  tcp/ip stack,  DS stack for your web application? ;;
"The way /u/TheyH8UsCuzTheyAnus described it more closely aligns with how I see the term applied in industry (Vancouver Tech, in case it's some local interpretation of the term). Frontend development is part of the ""stack"", as is Backend development. To be a ""full stack developer"" is to be comfortable working anywhere within the application stack. Some popular ""stacks"" are Mongo/Express/Angularode (as a JavaScript-heavy stack), or Apache/MySQL/PHP (as a well-known one).

I don't often see Ops get bundled into that term though. But maybe this whole ""DevOps"" movement will see that change, or a new term emerge that merges everything into some Stack-Transcendent Developer role.

Interestingly (to me), I don't usually see this term used outside of Web Development. Things tend to be more specific: ""Console Development"", ""Embedded Systems"", ""Mobile App Development"", etc.

Does anyone have any experiences that are inconsistent with this? I'm curious!";;
No I believe you are correct full stack dev would generally apply to web development, not other forms of software engineering.;;
The stack is the set of hardware and software technologies that comprise everything needed to serve a website to your browser.  Full stack means both front end tech (html, CSS, JavaScript and the frameworks built on them) as well as back end tech (web server, database, other underlying logic.). For full stack JavaScript apps, JavaScript is the language used for both the front end styling and communication as well as the back end logic used to communicate with the database and web server.;;
Thank you.;;
"Could you share it here? I'd be very interested in seeing it.
";;
Trello is weird, I need your email address to share the board. ;;
JavaScript can be easier than C in some ways, but I feel like understanding the things that make C more difficult is also an important part of a solid CS education.;;
At school I have been introduced to programming with C, and I did not fully understand certain concepts until I started learning JavaScript on my own. ;;
Could you share it for us?;;
PM me your email address. ;;
"This is crazy as I was just searching for a free online computer science degree curriculum today. This was spurred by my interest in taking the ""[From NAND to Tetris](http://www.nand2tetris.org/)"" course (which I'm about to start) and thinking about where should I go from there.

In my searches I found [Online Learning: A Bachelor's Level Computer Science Program Curriculum](http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/05/online-learning-bachelors-level.html) and its follow up article [Online Learning: An Intensive Bachelor's Level Computer Science Program Curriculum, Part II](http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/06/online-learning-intensive-bachelors.html). I also found this article [$200K for a computer science degree? Or these free online classes?](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2614635/application-development/-200k-for-a-computer-science-degree--or-these-free-online-classes-.html) from a couple of years ago.

This site [ONLINE COMPUTER SCIENCE COURSES:
MOOCS FOR TECHIES, PROGRAMMERS AND OTHER CS ENTHUSIASTS](http://www.computerscienceonline.org/courses/) had some courses broken down into different topics, but no real curriculum per se.

Thanks for putting this together and I hope to embark on The Open-Source Computer Science Degree in a few months after I finish the NAND2Tetris course. :)";;
It's worth adding some of the missing courses here into the above, even if under an electives category. In a CS degree a number of CS electives are also required along with the core courses.;;
"I would add the CS61X track, followed by CS70, from UC Berkeley. Year long sequence of intro to CS, covering several languages, and then a dedicated Discrete Structures course. All offered free through iTunes U and updated every term (I believe).

http://webcast.berkeley.edu/series.html#c,d,Computer_Science";;
This looks great! Really like that they just link to a youtube playlist, its a pain downloading from coursera and all.;;
Thanks for this! Maybe this could even be the basis for an expanded curriculum with special tracts and minors?;;
"Um, did you even look at the classes before putting them in your list?  MIT's 6.8xx are graduate level classes.  This ""curriculum"" doesn't make any sense.";;
So this is something that would follow a Uni course rather than be a part of it? ;;
"Correct. If it is a ""graduate"" level course it means one has entered into a Masters or PhD program, generally speaking.

Sometimes they have an undergraduate version of that course and sometimes the undergrad and grad courses are taught in the same classroom.";;
fwiw you can take grad courses as an undergrad (maybe not at all universities);;
In my University there are some courses cross-listed, usually 6000 level courses. Undergraduates are never allowed in 8000 level courses.;;
"> Correct. If it is a ""graduate"" level course it means one has entered into a Masters or PhD program, generally speaking.

I see -- at mine the non-cross-listed courses can still be taken with permission from the professor (which usually say yes)";;
"So how many years is supposed to represent? 

4 Terms makes me think that this is one year - though maybe US call years a term or something I'm not sure. ";;
"Most US universities divide the academic years into fall and spring semesters (roughly September-December and January-May), with one or two optional summer terms that generally have compressed courses of some sort. So if by ""terms"" the OP means semesters in this sense, it's 4 semesters or roughly 2 years.

That said, I suspect that the pacing in practice would mainly depend on the time and effort that the learner could put into it.";;
"Right cool - would be cool to get some clarification on this /u/easy_bake_coven , nice idea though :)

";;
"The beauty of this format is that one can learn at his or her own pace. So if the goal is to finish the program in 2 years, each term can be 6 months, or in 1 year each term would be 3 months, etc. It's all up to the individual learner. 

The curriculum is based on a typical 4 year university program, so each term would be 1 year and the student would be taking all kinds of general education and elective courses along with these.";;
Right cool - some are saying that some of the courses are inappropriate as they're grad level rather than uni. ;;
"In some cases I could only find the MIT grad level courses for a particular subject. Thanks to the support of the community, suggestions for alternative or easier have been already added to the project. As an aside, I also wouldn't be scared of graduate level courses. Just because they're part of a graduate program does not mean they're incredibly difficult, and could provide a nice challenge for even a student that considers him or herself ""undergraduate"".";;
OP mentioned core classes. Depending on the major, 2 years is about right. The rest would be requirements, electives, classes for one's minor, projects, thesis if required, etc. ;;
Several of the courses you've linked to seem to be graduate-level.  MIT 6.851 (under Data Structures) and MIT 6.823 (under Computer Architecture) both seem to have this problem.  I didn't check most of the others.;;
This looks more like software engineering / programming curriculum. Computer Science here requires much much more math; between 1/6 and 1/4 of total credits is pure math, along with courses on theoretical computer science.;
"Exactly.  The real problem is few people seem to make the proper distinction between programming and computer science.  You see it all the time when people ask questions like 'do I really need to know this math or that theory class? I've never needed in my programming job'. 

If your want to go build the next greatest checkbook balancing business app then great, go be a programmer.  If you want to advance the state of the art in machine learning or computer vision then study computer science and ask the requisite math and theory curses. But people need to understand they are quite different. ";;
There is no course listing for data structure and algorithms before the term 2 advance data structure?;;
"I remember coming across a link of someone compiling a list of resources they felt were equivalent to a CS degree. For whatever it's worth:

"What I'd really like to see is a rating of how clear/easy to understand the various courses are.  There are hundreds of free to paid courses covering most topics, but I have limited time so it would be good to know i'm looking at the most useful ones.

What about 6.00.1x for an introduction course? Its pretty well done and i'm taking it along with cs50. Cs50 may be a bit harder though;;
I tried taking 6.00.1x and it bored me to tears compared to cs50.;;
Magnificent. Thanks for taking the time on this!;;
Splendid. ;;
People are mentioning that the levels are all over the shop - have you checked the level for these courses and put them in an appropriate order or is this just a jumble of different online courses? ;;
This seems to be exactly the sort of thing I've been looking for. It's structured and breaks it down so I know what is what. I graduated college in 2012 with a liberal arts degree (political science) but I have always had a passion for technology. I'm not advanced like most people here, but I build my own computers (nothing fancy, but I don't know many people that can build their own computer). I'm hoping that maybe this will help me better understanding programming so I can possibly land a job in the future without a CS degree.;;
[Online Learning: An Intensive Bachelor's Level Computer Science Program Curriculum](http://blog.agupieware.com/2014/06/online-learning-intensive-bachelors.html). I have found this as a alternative to this open degree, can somebody more enlighten then me in CS put these according to the terms or semester. As of right now, I don't know how to start this, probably with an introduction but what do I need to study simultaneously with introduction.;;
Saved;;
Great list, but one issue is that you've put Cal's CS 61A, 61B, 61C all in one term when they're actually meant to be taken sequentially. Taking 61C without 61A/B is very difficult... taking all 3 of those concurrently is an impossible workload. I suspect it would be a similar case with the other universities so you might want to separate those out into 3 terms.;;
"I'm sorry, but I truly don't understand how you can put *OR* between Harvard's CS50x and Stanford's CS101. Have you tried these courses yourself?

I finished both of these, and I believe that CS50x is a must for everyone who just gets started. How about separating it on its own? CS101 in turn gives you some interesting insights on such topics as the structure of digital images and sound, but it's nowhere as broad and useful for a future programmer, as CS50x is.

Can't tell anything about the other 2 MOOCs from 'Intro' section, though.";;
"All of the courses are video based courses .. No love for bandwidth-strapped users :(

Maybe a another file that holds book resources for the courses would be really nice

"Does it help to realize that almost nobody understands every detail of the programs we write? Yes, even ""Hello, world"". On the surface, maybe that seems ridiculous. But there are parts of

    std::cout << ""Hello World!"" << std::endl;
that are mysteries to me. Now, I'm only speaking from my personal experience here, but I don't know what actual source for std::cout is. I don't know the source behind ""<<"". They might as well be sorcery to me, but then, I don't need to know, either. I have to just accept that the system works the way it does and move on with my life, or I'll go mad reading std library source code. And say I got through all that. Say I spent years and became the world's leading expert on the standard library. What next? The Windows source code? The Linux kernel source? The *compiler's* source? Assembly language? Building computers out of transistors or whatever the hell computers are made out of?

So, you know, take it easy on yourself. Understand the things you can understand and don't sweat the other stuff. When I inherit a new codebase at work (which happens a lot), the way I approach it is to mentally mark everything that it does as ""magic"". Then I dig in and find a piece that makes sense. That part is no longer magic, and then I slowly demystify all the other parts that I need to understand. To be clear, that's not the same as understanding all of it. I learn enough of it to fix the bugs I need to fix or make the change I need to make and just leave the rest alone. If I get to spend more time with the project, maybe I'll eventually get to it all. Maybe I won't. That's just life. Try to relax and have fun with it. Enjoy the learning, enjoy the problem-solving, enjoy the pure applied logic of coming up with a code solution.";;
"Don't use cout, its slow and outdated. Use puts() and printf() they're way faster.

""<<"" Is the bitshift operator usually but its also used for streams for some reason. Looking at the disasm it acts exactly like a function being called, everything between << acts as an argument.

Assembly language is actually quite awesome I recommend you look into it.";;
Assembly is a cool thing for people to learn, just to learn about computers, but what is the blurb about cout? I highly doubt there is any significant performance difference in cout and printf() unless you're using cout incorrectly (abusing endl or making it sync with printf()), the performance difference will be anything but a few milliseconds (the only sources I could find from a Google search suggesting printf was faster were 4-5 years old). cout also is more type safe. And by what standards in cout outdated? ;;
Run a test yourself. For 5000 lines cout and printf has a nearly 7 second time difference.;;
"I ran a test. On my rig (i5 4690K, running windows 8.1), using std::cout is consistently faster than printf() (of course, a few tests on one rig hardly matters). I used Microsoft's C++ compiler. Here was my source code:

    #include <chrono>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <iostream>

    int main()
    {
	    using std::chrono::duration_cast;
	    using std::chrono::nanoseconds;
	    typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock clock;

	    decltype(clock::now()) start, end;

	    start = clock::now();
	    for (int i = 0; i < 5000; ++i)
		    printf(""\n"");
	    end = clock::now();
	    auto printf_time = duration_cast<nanoseconds>(end - start).count();

	    start = clock::now();
	    for (int i = 0; i < 5000; ++i)
		    std::cout << '\n';
	    std::cout << std::endl;
	    end = clock::now();

	    std::cout << duration_cast<nanoseconds>(end - start).count() << ""ns for cout"" << std::endl;
	    std::cout << printf_time << ""ns for printf"" << std::endl;
    }

I ran three tests. Here were the results:

* Test 1: cout - 100698900ns, printf 171781400ns
* Test 2: cout - 105100900ns, printf 156132700ns
* Test 3: cout - 137130700ns, printf 229204100ns

Again, one test on one rig proves nothing, but this is hardly a seven second difference. On average, cout was faster by 71395899ns, or ~.07 seconds. So this difference is *much* lower than 7 seconds, and in favor of cout. Run this code on your system, tell me what you get.";;
"I modified your code a little to make it more fair: https://gist.github.com/jesyspa/de191acb0a3d54e409a1

In your case `std::cout` could have been more efficient due to knowing you were only inserting one character (it would be more like `putc` than like `printf`).

Results:

    1624132ns for cout
    26452468ns for printf

Results with `> /devull`:

    493453ns for cout
    265750ns for printf

Results without `sync_with_stdio(false)`:

    18154711ns for cout
    20782364ns for printf

Interestingly, `puts` is an order of magnitude slower.

So the conclusion is, use `printf` if you don't want to see the result of what you're displaying. :)";;
Thanks, I didn't know that the one character test was biased towards cout as I've never done much with the C I/O before. Really interesting about the cout being that faster, though. When I made my test I thought I was going to see a few milliseconds difference, not something as big as your first test.;;
"I forgot to mention that my test I ran with the text ""Test\n"". However the results of your exact test (with the fixing of the redefinition of printf_time ofc) was similar to yours. However running your exact test with text, of any kind, and cout's speed drops significantly and results in printf taking half the time as cout. Enabling compiler optimizations will increase printf's apparent speed even more at this point by using puts instead of printf. 

printf time: 353531035

cout time: 767113943

puts time: 328921861";;
My point is that I didn't know. Now I have infinity-2 things I don't know. Thanks!;;
Just get out and do it. Nobody cares if you fail, we all fail. Its alright to make a mistake.;;
"I used to be in your position. Then I changed my mindset. 

Seems you might have a fixed mindset, where you think that struggling is bad, where you think that if you struggle, you are not smart enough.

"This is a highly modified version of a [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/36o17c/i_want_to_code_but_im_not_motivated_enough_to_do/crfn0g3) I left on another thread. 

I have the same problem, and am trying to work through it. This is what helps me:

1. **_Especially while first learning_, it's fine to have no more than a very basic understanding of how the pieces work.** You are not expected to rebuild the wheel. When you make a cake, do you first grow the wheat, then harvest it, then dry it and grind it into flour....while also managing your cocoa plantation and crafting a baking pan in your homemade forge, etc? Or do you buy the ingredients (or a box mix) at StuffMart? Use libraries. Use jquery and SQL. Use a drop-in X so you can focus on making Y. Etc.
2. **Your demons are wrong. It's not you, it's coding.** (see also my #1). Coding is hard. Professional experienced coders spend a good chunk of time googling syntax and debugging. Your code will have mistakes. The mistakes do not reflect on you as a person or as a coder, but rather on the difficulty of what you are trying to accomplish. Whenever your demons try to latch onto a your mistakes, check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/2x2s6y/when_you_spend_10_minutes_trying_to_fix_a_bug_and/) for commiseration and a reminder that the demons are wrong -- it's not you, it's coding.
3. **Make sure unrealistic goals aren't killing your gumption.** Each day, make it your goal to spend X minutes learning/writing code. Once you start, your goal is to keep putting an ""X"" on your calendar, to represent ""I coded today!"". Once you've hit your goal, there is _zero_ reason to push yourself through your #3 (""fail repeatedly""). See my #4.
4. **Don't let frustration stand in your way.** Stop before your #3 (""fail repeatedly"") leads to your #4 (""get angry/sad""). When you start to feel like you're ""failing repeatedly"", remind yourself of my #2 above. That feeling doesn't mean it's time to buckle down and push through -- it means it's time for a walk, a shower, reading a book... basically take a break. Give yourself permission to put things away until later/tomorrow. Your goal is to keep coding long-term, and self-destruction will not help with that. I know this is difficult... but you'd be surprised how many answers come to you in the shower or on a walk, once you've stepped away... or the instant you return to your code with fresh eyes.
5. **Do not be afraid to ask for help.** If you don't know how to do something or can't figure out why your code won't work (even if it seems too specific), ask google. If google doesn't help, post a question here, on Stack Exchange or Stack Overflow, or on the forums/subredit for the language/framework/library in question.
6. **Just keep coding.**

";;
"It doesn't sound like your problems really are specific to programming, so I'm not sure how much this'll help, but I'll try anyway.

When you look at it very abstractly, programming is a matter of fitting bits together to get your desired result.  (So, really, are a whole lot of other things.)  The goal is to get your result.  It doesn't matter who made the bits, or even what you know about the bits.  You will have to learn why attaching bit A to bit B does this and that, but that doesn't mean you have to know how bit A works on the inside.  Sometimes, it's best you don't.

If you're bothered by complexity, take something simple.  Python, for example, or Java.  Make a mental model that works on the level of the language you chose.  Variables, objects, functions.  Don't think about the implementation details of the language itself.  It doesn't matter.  The language has rules, and those are what you need to know.  Moving to a different level of abstraction before you're comfortable in the one you've started in is just going to make life difficult.

(If for some reason you can't accept that you can take the level of abstraction Java or Python offers as fundamental, try a lower level, like C or some form of assembly.  Some people prefer this approach.)

Using or not using libraries should not be a big deal.  My policy for my own projects is that there's got to be some one thing that I want to do myself (basically, the main task my program is fulfilling), and that anything else I will do with a library if possible.  I think I've learned more this way than I would have if I had avoided libraries entirely, as I'd have spent much more time on rote coding rather than learning truly new things.  If there's something I want to understand better (rather than leaving to a library), I make it the main goal of my next project.

"OP, remember that there are 3 parts of a ""for"" loop.  
for (int i = 0; i < n ; i++){ }

But what happens when you omit one of them?

for (int i = 0; i < n ; ) {}

As it turns out, these fields are optional.  So if you wanted to turn this for-loop into a while loop, you could simply remove the first and last sections to get 

for ( ; i < n ; )

Now, that's not going to solve your current predicament, but it should help you break out of the current mode of thinking.  Maybe, since the field isn't optional, initializing a variable ( int i = 0 ) isn't the only way to use that field.  ";;
"Thanks so much for your help. That is what I did with the other ""for"" loops. So far, all I am getting (at least for the first one) is

"Well, these operators are pretty complicated.  It's worth explaining them (you'll learn in detail about them later).  

The tilde ~ operator is the One's Complement operator.  It is a unary operator, meaning that it applies to one number at a time. It flips all of the bits in a number.  In some older computers, this would effectively negate the number.  So if you had a number that had a binary representation of a number that read out like 1011, the one's complement of that number would be 0100.  

The & operator is the bitwise-and operator.  It is a binary operator.  
In binary, 1 is true, 0 is false.   So, 1101 & 0100 == 0100.  


The number 1, in binary, is 0001 . There are more zeros, but this is an example.   To One's Complement that number, you would get 
1110 .  So ~1 is basically 1110.  Now, performing the bitwise & with ~1  ""saves"" all of the bits but the lowest bit.  
So if I had the number 7, which is 0111,  

7 & ~1 == 0110 == 6

Here's the thing about binary.  It's kinda like our decimal system.
 
You know that 126 is equal to 1* 10^2 + 2 * 10^1 + 6 * 10^0 
  

In binary, the number 7 is just 0 * (2^3) + 1 * (2^2) + 1 * (2^1) +1* (2^0)

You can see the 0111 much easier this way. 
Since every digit but the rightmost represents an even number, only odd numbers have 1* (2^0) in binary. 

So if you had 6, the number would not change because it is even. 

0110 & 

1110 

**0110**

The digit which represents the 2^0 -place is already 0, so we can see that ""& ~1"" is the same thing as ""round down to the nearest even number"".

Now, if you give the code any odd number, it will add 1 to that number, then round down to the nearest even number.
So if you gave it 7, it would add 1 to get 8, then round down to 8.  If you gave it 6, it would add 1 to get 7, then round back down to 6. 

This was an effort to optimize the code, since it only takes a mere 3 instructions from the CPU.  Your compiler will likely generate some extra bulk code with the way yours is written, but that's actually preferred in a world where programmers are accountable for their actions and the code that they write.

"it wasn't really an effort to optimize the code so much as it was to convert what he had to a for loop without a hideous ternary conditional.

I'm just a management consultant trying to figure out ways to make my life easier - I've done some research on git, and while it definitely looks useful for version control, I don't really think it's what I need, is it?";;
"Okay, your comment plus the quote from above lead me to a totally different idea

> Ideally, my workflow would be something like this: worked all day, made changes to 20 files in various directories. When finished for the day, run the script that overwrites the files in Dropbox with the updated files.

+ One problem is that mirroring the C Drive is not directly possible since there are also the operating system files that constantly change. So, going ""all over the place"" is not the way to go (I'm not saying that it is not possible or not doable, BTW). There should at least be *one* top level folder which contains all the folders that will be changed. That folder should definitely not be the root folder of the C drive.
+ You could use some free file/folder syncing utility, like
    + [Microsoft Synctoy](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15155) 
    + [FreeFileSync](https://www.freefilesync.org/)
    + or something similar.

   + Both utilities that I've listed above can sync folders (obviously), can perform two-way (mirroring) sync, one-way (echoing) sync with and without delete propagation, and more. They watch folders for changes and perform the copy operations in the background. FreeFileSync can be configured to run from the task scheduler or upon mouse click. Synctoy runs constantly in the background.
+ Another option that I've used successfully (along with the two above) is the Windows (Win 7 and up) built-in `robocopy` tool. This is a very powerful copy program that can also perform everything that FreeFileSync can do, but since it is a command line tool, it's quite difficult to configure. I'd recommend using a GUI to do the configuration [(link to some tool from MS)](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2006.11.utilityspotlight.aspx) or something like [RichCopy](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.04.utilityspotlight.aspx) (again from MS, seems to be a brushed up version of robocopy with a GUI).";;
"Thanks for the great comment.

Those tools are basically what I'm looking for, and I may come back around to using them, but I really want to see if I can create something in Python too - I know it's reinventing the wheel but I want to get better.

Going off your comment about the C drive, mirroring the whole C drive is not exactly what I aim to do. I'm working on an outline now and this is what I have so far:

Context:

*  I have 3 Windows Libraries (*WinLib*) that I use exclusively (""Notes&Code"", ""Personal"", ""Work""). Note - by windows libraries I'm talking about the autogenerated ""My Documents"", ""My Music"" type objects that come stock with Windows.

* Each WinLib holds various folders, all rooted in ""C:\Users\\<myname>"", but referenced separately in each Library.

* Dropbox contains 3 folder ""libraries"" (*DBoxLib*) that reflect the libraries in C: (""Notes&Code"", ""Personal"", ""Work"") - these Dropbox directories are only used for general backup, but not version control.

Script begins:

* Script compares WinLib names list with DboxLib names list.

* If WinLib exists but not DBoxLib, create DBoxLib.

* If DBoxLib exists but not WinLib, cut/paste DBoxLib to special review folder on desktop (to prevent accidental deletions - I wouldn't need to remove libraries ever from C but just a precaution).

* Now that DBoxLib == WinLib in all cases, compare folder lists in each Lib

* If WinLibFL1 (*folder level 1*) exists but not DBoxLibFL1, create DBoxLibFL1

* If DBoxLibFL1 exists but not WinLibFL1, move DBoxFL1 to review folder

Here is where it is more tricky when we get to to files:

* Each time script is run, a file *LastRun.txt* containing timestamp is generated.

* If script encounters a file at any folder level in WinLib, it will compare timestamps from LastRun to the file's Date Modified

* If Date Modified is later than LastRun, it copies file to appropriate DBoxLib folder.

* If Date Modified is earlier or equal to LastRun, it is left alone

And then the idea is that Python keeps searching through the entire directory of the 3 libraries in Dropbox and Windows, checking everything according to above logic until it is finished. Then updates LastRun.

1. Am I way off base? Does this even make sense? This is my first personal project.

1. Can I affect Windows Libraries with Python the way I am affecting them above? Or is it only possible to do if I group them in a file that reflects the Library names, except in C:? e.g. C:\Users\\<myname>\\***LibName***\FolderLevel1 instead of C:\Users\\<myname>\FolderLevel1, library referenced.  I am trying to affect the Libraries only because that is how I organized everything long ago, and didn't feel like changing, but I obviously can if Python can't ""read"" Windows Libraries. Or I can change my logic.

3. I know Python syntax mostly well enough that I think I can write this, but I'm just wondering if there are any extra Python plugins I need to grab to perform the type of file manipulation and directory searching I want to do? Or should it come stock? I'm on Python 3 btw.

Thanks for any help, let me know if this doesn't make sense.

"> you have to copy the entire data everytime

Do you actually? 

If it's impossible to mutate data, and if the only thing you can do is return new versions, do you actually _have_ to copy any data? Sometimes the answer is yes, but it turns out once you guarantee immutability, you have the opportunity to perform tons of optimizations that were otherwise unavailable, allowing you to avoid having to constantly make copies. For example, one strategy might be to keep track of only the _changes_ you made and reuse existing data. 

As an example, let's say I have an immutable list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and I want to append the number `0` to it. So, in Haskell, that might look something like:

    original :: [Integer]
    original = [1, 2, 3, 4]

    modified :: [Integer]
    modified = 0 : original

So just from looking at it, it would seem that internally Haskell has now duplicated some data and internally represented the data like so (which would be inefficient, as you noted):

    original -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

    modified -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4

However, since our lists are immutable, we can take advantage of that and chose to represent our data like so:

    original -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
                ^
                |
    modified -> 0

Basically, use a linked list, create a new cell and have it point back to the original (which is an O(1) operation), keep the original the same, and have the modified list point back to the original (since it can never be changed!) and reuse and share that data.

And in fact, this is arguably _more_ efficient then how non-functional languages would have done it! In languages that do not enforce immutability, you would want to make sure that a change in one list would not affect the other, and so would essentially be forced to make an extra copy. However, in functional languages, as long as you take care to use appropriate data structures, you can get away with doing much less work. 

";;
"> > you have to copy the entire data everytime

> Do you actually?

Often you don't need to copy the entire data, but the common case is that you can't share everything (thus have some copying to do) and you have also space overhead.

For instance, I know no [purely functional data structure](http://www.amazon.com/Purely-Functional-Structures-Chris-Okasaki/dp/0521663504) which allows array like indexed updates, in other word in O(1).  The best I know is O(log(n)) where n is the array length and it has a O(n) space overhead. (I admit that my knowledge is at the level of that book, not only more recent research result escapes me, but there is enough time since I've read it that I may misremember things).
";;
"I think the example is a bit too simple, what if you want to append to position n? Then you might want to do something like this
 
    original  -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 ->   4
               ^              |    ^
    modified -> |          -> 3.5  |     

this is quite messy, not to mention what if you have n list all want to do some updates (delete at nth, append at nth) or what if you have more complicated datastructure like AVL tree? The overheading seems hard to justified. 

Btw not an expert on the matter, just playing the devil's advocate hoping to get some good response";;
"Sure, if later in the program you're going to need the original list as well as the modified list, then you're going to have to make a copy. But of course you would have to make a copy in a non-functional language too, so you aren't losing anything in the functional language.

However, if it turns out that you actually never need the original list after that point in the program, then the compiler is free to modify the original list. And a language in which data is treated as immutable makes it *much* easier for the compiler to reason about how values are used in the code, which means the compiler is more likely to be able to detect that the original list is never needed again and can therefore be directly modified without being copied.";;
"> But of course you would have to make a copy in a non-functional language too

I don't think you have to make a new copy for updating a datastructure unless you deepcopy, usually you just pass by reference

";;
If you need the original list as well as the modified list, then you need to make a copy of the list. Passing by reference is completely irrelevant here.;;
"Yeah, you can't insert into the middle of a linked list without making a copy.  Even if you could get that branching thing to work, you'd have to modify the node to add it.

Instead, you'll find that if you write in FP idioms, you rarely need to be modifying a list in that way.  This sort of involves restructuring your code from the foundation, so if you're thinking ""but what about [algorithm/situation] that clearly needs to do that?"" then that's normal. 

";;
"> Yeah, you can't insert into the middle of a linked list without making a copy.

Sure you can, if the original list won't be needed again.";;
"I don't think that's the best way to think about it.  Try this way instead.

In a programming language you've got two kinds of things: objects and values.  I'm using these terms very generally now.  An object is just something that can store a value, and a value is, well, a value.

For a simple example: when you do `int x = 5;`, `x` is an `int` object that stores the value `5`.

For a more complex example: in a language like C# or Java, you might have `class Foo { int x; int y; }` and `Foo foo = new Foo();`.  Now `foo` is an object.  Its value is a reference to the `Foo` object that was allocated, and that object is basically a blob of two `int` objects, each of which have some value of their own.

To boil it down to generalities again: an object is a place you can store things in, a value is something you can store.

What functional languages do is, by default, not introduce objects.  You don't have anything to store values in; all you can do is give names to them.  That might sound similar, but it isn't: giving your car a name isn't the same as having a place to put it.  In functional languages, most operations are just done on values and people don't bother with objects.  Instead, compilers figure out where to store things.

The thing is that unlike in a language where objects are commonplace, you don't tell your program how to perform the updates.  You never actually say ""copy this whole thing but with that changed"".  You say ""create a value from such and such values"".  How and where that value is created is not up to you.  In fact, it might not be created at all, if you never get around to using it.

Sometimes you want more control than that.  In that case, you just create some objects manually, for example by using `IORef` or `STRef` or `MVar`.  When using these you basically switch to an imperative style for that part of your program.  If you really wanted to, you could write all your code this way.      You'd lose the benefits that the functional nature of Haskell gives you, though.";;
Since everything's immutable you can share all the data you want...;;
"This gets asked a lot, and there are a lot of opinions.  Here's mine, and I think it's solid.

You know the company you want to work for, right?

You know the products they make, or the products they use internally that you'd be working on, right?

If not, then do some research and try to figure it out.  What does their website advertise?  What do interviews and press releases they've issued mention?  What have their primary employees worked on at previous jobs you can find through LinkedIn and such?

Do your homework and figure out what they use programmers for.

Now sit down and design a very simple, rudimentary, version of that kind of project.

For instance, say they're, whatever, eBay.

You know what eBay basically does.

So what's stopping you from writing a simple website tonight that lets you create a user, edit their profile, create an auction, edit the auction, and bid on an auction?

It doesn't have to look beautiful, it just has to check those boxes at the ""hello, world"" level.

Once you've got it working at the basic level, beautify it a little bit, and then add visible notes and comments like a delete link for an auction that says ""not implemented yet"".

Think through what else it would really need to be an effective application, and make some notes.

Then go talk to them, show them the application, discuss your notes and comments, show them the source code, etc.

This, to me, would be a lot more persuasive than if you just did some bland Fizzbuzz or linked list sample, or something stupid that shows off dopey language quirks that won't matter if you move to a different language in six months.  

You wouldn't write a cover letter that brags about your knowledge of lambda functions, so why would you build a demo project that does that?

You know who you're targeting.  You have ammo.  Use it.

But there are a lot of opinions.";;
From my experience with interviews in general employers like to hear about any and all kinds of hands on coding projects (school, work, and personal).  They also like to ask questions about straight forward language concepts and examples for them (polymorphism, inheritance, deadlocks, race conditions, data structures, etc).  So I suggest coding small programs that highlight key features of the language you want to prove you know.  Focus on demonstrating why you should use that language.;;
"In an ideal world, you should try and make complex/complete projects -- something that you actually want and would actually use, or are passionate about. That motivation would then drive you to push the project to completion + spend time polishing and developing it, and as a side effect cause you to generate enough code to allow somebody to get a good understanding of where you stand. 

However, it sounds like you're crunched for time, and developing a good portfolio will take months, if not years, so here are some ideas for generating code samples relatively quickly:

1. You mentioned having some prior coding experience. If you've completed projects in those languages, it might be worth showing those to your employer in addition to any Python code you're writing (the idea is that somebody who knows how to code can be taught a new language much more easily then somebody who doesn't know how to code at all + that being able to code in any language is a very strong indicator that you can learn to code in a different one)
2. Try converting some of your old projects to Python? (The danger is you run the risk of converting them into ""unpythonic"" code, though since you stated you were a beginner, you'd probably get a pass if you did so)
3. The [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_where_can_i_find_practice_exercises_and_project_ideas.3F) has links to different exercises and project ideas. In particular, I'd take a look at bulleted list of programming exercises and try some of those. 
4. If you're looking for some more semi-realistic/involved applications to demonstrate, try taking a look at /r/dailyprogrammer or https://github.com/karan/Projects for inspiration.

"> Question, would ""lock free"" essentially mean ""deadlock free""?

No, that's not what I said. Lock free implies deadlock free, but that is just one property. Even thread safe means deadlock free. Lock free is what I said above, where a thread cannot cause the entire system to lock up, even if the thread stops progressing.

> Also, would an example of a lock free data structure be one that blocks until a timeout or until it is ready?

This example has nothing to do with concurrency.";;

"If you're new to JavaScript, I suggest this:

Should I be learning Javascript first before attempting to learn Node?;;
Node is Javascript. It's just Javascript running in a different environment. You'll need an understanding of the language before understanding the platform.;;
As u/Lynxx said. Node is JavaScript. JavaScript has some tricky parts to learn before you jump in to something like node, but Elequent JavaScript does a good job at explaining it. There is even a node section at the end.;;
I agree. I've been reading it now and it helps quite a bit. Thank you everyone for your suggestion.;;
"One bug I see:

    string scissors = ""scissors"";
but you specify

    choice = choice.ToUpper();
so your check

    else if (choice == scissors)
will never hold true

also let me suggest to post your code via pastebin or a similar site so it doesnt bloat your post that much

also a general piece of advice:

inside your ""switch""-Statement you always use code of the structure

    if(choice == rock)
    {
        ....
    }
    else if(choice == paper)
    {
        ....
    }
    else if (choice == scissors)
    {
        ....
    }
    else ....

and within those blocks you always use very similar pieces of code. If/When you notice something like this, try to find a way to get rid of the repetitions of this by using more variables or methods.";;
"To add to this, the choice could be an Enum. That will prevent people from accidentally supplying ""lizard"" or ""spock"" unless you intend it.";;
"The thing with scissors was at the last minute I noticed I typed ""sissors"", so I use find, and replace all.

So you're saying I should attempt to create a method that'll replace all that repeated code?";;
"yes, for example a method that takes two inputs (hand signs or whatever you call them) and returns some indicator which sign won (lets say, return 0 if tie, 1 if player 1 wins, 2 if player 2 wins as a basic example). Then use this to shorten the rest of your code. 

If you need help with it, feel free to ask but try it for yourself first.";;
"Few comments :


When comparing strings, instead of `ToUpper()` then comparing them, try instead using `string.Equals()`, as such :


    string.Equals(choice, ""paper"", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase);

For string concatenation, some of us might prefer `string.Format(""Hello, {0}!"", name)` instead of `""Hello,"" + name + ""!""`. To me it's a lot more readable. In C# 6 you will be able to interpolate, `$""Hello, {name}!""`. Which I think will be the best option of all. 

If you find yourself needing to copy-paste, consider if it could be turned into a function. 


Also, check out [Gist](https://gist.github.com/). ";;
"You could/should use arrays for your values.  For example, if you use an array for the values of ""rock"", ""paper"", ""scissors"" you could then update your code to ""lizard"", ""spock"" and it would still work.


    string[] Options = {""rock"", ""paper"", ""scissors""}     
    int random = numberGen.Next(0, Options.length - 1);  //arrays start at zero

Ha ha. I think I came up with a solution. I just need to create a couple of .png images that are shadows for several scenarios of item depth and sizes, then let tkinter resize some for the in-between sizes.;;
Unless you are heavily invested in Swing or have to work with a lot of code that uses Swing, and since you are learning you are likely not, then go with JavaFX. ;;
Thanks alot ;;
The official ~~Sun~~Oracle java tutorials are good and have a nice set on javafx (as well as swing).;;

I didn't see any posts of people just posting their code, so I didn't want to do it myself. It's okay to ask for help, and post my code in this subreddit, not just ask a question of where I could do so?;;
"> I didn't see any posts of people just posting their code

You haven't been looking too hard.

> It's okay to ask for help, and post my code in this subreddit

That's what this reddit is all about.";;
You're right, I didn't look hard enough. Now should I make a new post, or should I just edit this post....?;;
New post, most likely, unless it's quick.;;
I just made a simple rock, paper, scissors game. It's my first attempt at a script after watching tutorials for a while, and reading a bit. I just want to know what I should work on so I can learn, and become a better coder.;;
I'd probably make a new post if I were you, a new / more fitting title will get you more attention.;;
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. I'm going to do that.;;
New post.;;
Something like www.exercism.io might be up your alley;;
Hrml5 and JavaScript might be the best option. But it'll eventually need to be made into an xcode project ;;
"Get a backend language like PHP, python or ruby and have it create an HTML form. 

You can submit data through the form in order to update values in the database.";;
"What languages are you familiar with? Python + its django framework allow you to make something pretty easily if you're familiar with python. If you prefer something with a C syntax -> PHP will be easy. Then there's Ruby on Rails. 

All of the above allow what you want. I'd choose a language/syntax you're most comfortable with and go with that. Your specific problem is small and simple enough so the language semantics won't matter. ";;

"If it's to identify a specific person it can be done. We can use various facial features as landmarks. 

If you want a program to be able to differentiate between an animal and a human, that's a difficult [question](http://xkcd.com/1425/).

There are many animals with a similar enough facial structure that can throw it off (e.g. monkeys, apes). 

[How Facial Recognition Systems Work](http://electronics.howstuffworks.com/gadgets/high-tech-gadgets/facial-recognition.htm)";;
"Usually machine learning.

The textbook example would be that you start with a set of images.  Each image is pre-classified as either ""animal"" or ""human"" (this is done manually).

Then, you feed all these pre-classified images (and their classification) to the machine learning algorithm, and the algorithm then determines some *attributes* which are correlated with the classifications, and builds a *model* that then takes a picture and classifies it.

The strength of the model depends on how good the input images are, how good the algorithm is, and other factors.

For instance, as in the link you gave, if your pre-classified images are biased (e.g. maybe they don't contain enough images of people that have darker skin), then you may get biased results.

Machine learning is used for a variety of things, including things like email spam filters.";;
Which SFML tutorial are you following?;;
None, all of them are about Code::Blocks or Visual Studio. If you have one for MinGW only can you link it to me?;;
"What does googling for ""sfml gcc"" give you as the first result?";;
A linux tutorial. Which is not what I'm asking for. :(;;
It will work on Windows. And anyway, what's so wrong with Code::Blocks? It's what I use as an IDE for all may larger projects.;;
"There's nothing wrong with it, I just don't want to use.

Do I have to compile SFML to be able to use it? I'm getting an error when running my program's .exe ""procedure entry point blablabla could not locate sdaojdkxcmzasdp in graphics dynamic link library""";;
IIRC there is some linking of libraries that you have to do but that's about it. Try searching on how to link libraries in makefiles. That might give you a few pointers. I did mine with Code::Blocks but remember making a makefile afterwards that worked with gcc.;;
Yeah, I got it to work now. Thanks.;;
Haha, welcome to programming...here's a hint, you're missing a closing parentheses.;;

Dude, we all know that feeling...and this will not be the last time that happens.;;
This is why I didn't wanna get into programming... but I think I've learned to accept it now. Is this why so many people code when they're high?;;
"This is how I learned that I loved programming. When I first started out, there were several times I stayed up all night trying to figure out a bug in my code. 

It was incredibly frustrating and there were times I just wanted to throw the stupid computer and be done with it. But when you get it figured out and the program is doing exactly what you want it to? That was enough of a high for me. ;)";;
Yeah, even that tiny shitty program was pretty fun to write. No one needs women when they can just [organize their code folders into a woman.](http://i.imgur.com/Dhjik.jpg);;

Is that how fast it took you? I'm assuming you already have a good amount of programming experience if so?;;
There are soooo many variables to both your question and the answer. If it's something that interests you and you want to do it then go for it! If you're determined, you'll get there.;;
Lol;;
Do you know any programming languages?;;
I started to do a bit of HTML and CSS but then stopped, because I was busy with school.;;
Ok, that's zero programming languages.  You might be able to estimate how long swift will take you if you learn some other programming language, otherwise it's a total guess.  Some people learn the basics in days, other take months and still don't know shit from Shinola.;;
Okay, well thank you. I guess i'll just have to give it a go and see what happens. How did you learn, if you don't mind me asking?;;
I got a book that came with a sample game in it.  Probably something like Al Sweigart's books, which are free.;;
Thank you very much for your advice. ;;
