"<div class="md"><p>Have you tried debugging your application to see what your variables are doing.I will tell you this. absorbed_dose and excration_rate are both consts, so their values never changes. </p>

<p>That is, absorbed_dose(130.00) - absorbed_dose(130.00) * excration_rate(0.13) will ALWAYS be computed by the CPU to be the same value. This value is 113.1, which you then assign to variable called remain.</p>

<p>Then you do another calculation: remain(113.1) - excretion_rate(0.13) * remain(113.1) which is, 98.4 which you assign to next.</p>

<p>So when hour_count = 0, your values are [remains = 113.1],[next = 98.4]
When hour_count = 1, your values are again the same because nothing has changed between the variables of the 0th loop and the 1st loop.</p>

<p>My hint to you is this: The dosage you need to subtract needs to change for each time you continue to loop.</p>

<p>0th loop: 16.9
1st loop: 33.8
2th loop: 50.7
etc</p>

<p>Then you can subtract that dosage from your dosage constant and print it. Look at using hour_count to your advantage to calculate how much dosage you need to subtract.</p>

</ul>

<p>Two contexts where Java is used are back-end services (web applications, cloud computing) and mobile (android), among others. You can start there.</p>

<p>A few domain-agnostic things java devs should learn are:
* <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns">Design Patterns</a> and <a href="https://sourcemaking.com/antipatterns">Anti-Patterns</a>
* Unit Testing (JUnit, Mockito, Selenium)
* Build Systems (Ant, Maven, Gradle)</p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Here is the general idea of how to do this in Java:
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arguments you take as an input will be args[] in your main method, hence:
<code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
&nbsp;</p>

<p>args[] is an array of Strings separated by the spaces. Thus, if you did
<code>java playerkills Enter data: West Nolan 5 done</code>,
then args[0] = &quot;Enter&quot;, args[1] = &quot;data:&quot;, args[2] = &quot;West&quot;, args[3] = &quot;nolan&quot;, args[5] = &quot;Nolan&quot;, args[6] = &quot;done&quot;.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have those arguments, you can figure out how you want to format your data.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once you have this data, you want it to be stored somewhere so you can get it back when you want. I recommend you look into Java&#39;s <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/File.html">File</a> library. You can store your strings of data directly onto the file.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other thoughts:
&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.) How you store it doesn&#39;t matter, although instead of using a multidimensional array, I really suggest you look into <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html">HashMaps</a>, and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/innerclasses.html">private classes</a>, although if you want to learn how to use a HashMap effectively, you will need to learn how to implement a good hashCode(). Sorry this is a bit more off topic. A multidimensional array will work just fine, although it won&#39;t be as optimized (not that it matters unless you&#39;re putting in 10<sup>6</sup> + entries.
&nbsp;</p>

<p>2.) If you wanted to store your data better, instead of using file input and output, look into java&#39;s <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html">Serializable</a>. This can directly store your data structures, although it only works with objects that implement the Serializable interface (such as arrays and HashMaps).
&nbsp;</p>

<p>3.) All of these suggestions seem like a lot to learn, but you will use this in the future in some capacity I believe. RTFM now, and it&#39;ll be much easier to pick it back up later.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s normal to learn 5 languages, but it&#39;s normally not so many languages that are so similar, at least in my experience.  It should be languages that help you learn specific things, like data structures and algos, OSes, functional programming, declarative / logic programming, larger program design and implementation, etc.  Learning 4 languages just to write similar small programs using OOP isn&#39;t going to help you significantly more than doing that with 1 language.</p>

<p>If you actually learn C# reasonably well and develop reasonable coding skills with it, almost no other language will be difficult to pick up or take a long time to pick up.</p>

"<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Lets say on some imaginary system, an int is 4 bytes and a char is 8 bytes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By definition in C, a <code>char</code> is one byte and an <code>int</code> is at least as large as a <code>char</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would a pointer of type char also be 8 bytes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A pointer isn&#39;t of type <code>char</code>, but it can be of type <code>char *</code>.</p>

<p>Typically, on current desktop platforms, all pointers are of the same size, and that size is not related to the size of any non-pointer type. On other platforms, the size of two different pointer types may be different. There are, for example, platforms on which byte pointers consist of a word pointer, a bit offset, and a length. On other platforms, a pointer to a function is of a different size than a pointer to data because code and data are in different memories.</p>

<p>In other words, don&#39;t assume anything about the sizes of pointers. In fact, don&#39;t assume anything about the size of any type other than what is clearly stated in the standard.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A 32-bit register can store 232<sup>32</sup> different values.

Hence, a processor with 32-bit memory addresses can directly access 4 GiB of byte-addressable memory.</p>

<p>A 64-bit register can store 264<sup>64</sup> (over 18 quintillion or 1.8×1019) different values. Hence, a processor with 64-bit memory addresses can directly access 264<sup>64</sup> bytes (=16 exbibytes) of byte-addressable memory.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Ah, yeah. sorry on that, my fault entirely. You were using int.Parse; I copied from that line. But I changed the qty vars to Decimal (which is better for dealing with money). You can change it to Decimal.Parse, or change the qty vars back to int.</p>

<p>As far as the out... Normally if you call a function, and pass an int (or any reference type), only a reference (think copy) is passed. The original value (in the calling function) isn&#39;t changed, even if it is changed inside the function called. </p>

<p>This breaks a bit when you are passing class objects (non-reference types), since you are passing a reference to the actual object, not a value. </p>

<p>out changes this behavior, passing a variable by-value, such that changes made inside the called function, will be &#39;passed back&#39; to the original variable.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t get all excited and making your own out functions all over the place. In general, it is considered bad practice. </p>

<p>The basis for using it here is because TryParse returns a bool telling you if the conversion was successful, with the result into the out variable.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>That question amounts to &quot;How come I can call functions with parameter values of different types than the declared types of the parameters?&quot;. As in, how come you can pass an <code>int</code> value when you should have passed an <code>int *</code> value.</p>

<p>Well, in the case of <code>printf()</code>, the parameters do not have any type declared except the first one, the format string. The types of the rest of the parameters are determined by <code>printf()</code> by looking at the conversion specifiers in the format string.</p>

<p>When you say <code>%p</code> in the format string, you are in effect saying to <code>printf()</code> &quot;Here is a number which I promise is a pointer, and I want you to print it as such.&quot;. It&#39;s up to you to get it right. This is so because you can put anything you like in the format string, and so it&#39;s not possible to declare the types for the parameters which <code>printf()</code> takes, it has to accept any types and any number of parameters. That&#39;s what the <code>...</code> means in the declaration for <code>printf()</code>.</p>

<p>In other cases besides <code>printf()</code>, there are type conversions done on the parameters. That is, if a function takes a <code>long</code> and you pass an <code>int</code>, for example, the value is implicitly converted to a <code>long</code> for your convenience. In some cases, these conversions make perfect sense, as in the case of <code>int</code> -&gt; <code>long</code>. In other cases, they make less sense, and you have probably caused the conversion by mistake, by accidentally passing the wrong kind of parameter. I recommend that you switch on warnings with the <code>-Wall</code> switch so that the compiler tells you when this has happened.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>True, in the case of move constructors you can see value out of making a copy.  I suppose in the case of giving names to objects as in the OP question it would be useful. Still, I think it&#39;s important to at least give these lines of reasoning a thought, especially after that performance issue we ran into. Sometimes a copy is the way to go, and sometimes it isn&#39;t.</p>

<p>Unfortunately for the vast majority of my use of string they wouldn&#39;t be useful so I haven&#39;t gotten around to converting stuff for them, right now only our really big stuff keeps names around, and they&#39;re keys to maps or negligible in number. On top of that we&#39;re likely to move to our own String class over the summer for various reasons, and hopefully we&#39;ll switch to using IDs in the maps. </p>

<p>To clarify - when I called the Scanner again it was assigning an empty enter space to useranswer since that was sitting in the stream after I prompted my user to input a double? Then why would I be able to successfully prompt the user to input another double? Is the code doing a two-step assignment, first assigning a blank input, then the console input? That would explain why the while loop condition would fail without messing up my actual variables, I just want to make sure I understand what happened correctly.   </p>

"<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a question of the problem type.  </p>

<p>PC CPUs are mostly scalar processors. This means they execute one instruction at a time, on one piece of data at a time. (Note: They are actually far more complicated than that, this is just a simplified model.) They are optimized to do this as fast as possible, and so can execute a single chain of commands very quickly.</p>

<p>GPUs on the other hand are more akin to something called a vector processor. They aren&#39;t able to execute as many instructions per second, but they are able to execute those same instructions over many different pieces of data. This gives them tremendous advantage in algorithms that are heavily parallelizable but makes them poor general purpose processors.</p>

<p>A CPU is generally faster for complex operations where each step depends on the results of the last step.</p>

<p>A GPU will generally be faster when you have simple operations you have to perform many times on independent data.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>What you&#39;re looking at in the hex editor is <em>machine code</em> (amongst other things). In general, machine code works by assigning a certain byte sequence to each instruction that the processor is capable of, and each instruction takes a certain number of arguments, which are put after the byte sequence.</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say you have this byte sequence in the machine code:</p>

<pre><code>B8 FF FF 00 00
</code></pre>

<p>In this sequence in 32-bit x86 machine code, <code>B8</code> is the value meaning &quot;copy the following 32-bit value to the EAX register&quot;. 32 bits is 4 bytes, and the next 4 bytes are <code>FF FF 00 00</code>. Since the x86 architecture is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness">little-endian</a>, you have to reverse those bytes to get the actual number: 0x0000FFFF (or simply 0xFFFF). This is equal to 65535, so the byte sequence above means &quot;copy the value 65535 to the EAX register&quot;.</p>

<p>Obviously, machine code is hard to read, so assembly language makes it a bit easier. In Intel assembly language, this would be coded as:</p>

<pre><code>mov eax, 0xFFFF
</code></pre>

<p>or:</p>

<pre><code>mov eax, 65535
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this isn&#39;t adding or modifying any of the bytes in the file - it&#39;s simply displaying them in a different way. Either of the above instructions will <em>directly</em> convert (or &#39;assemble&#39;) into the byte sequence <code>B8 FF FF 00 00</code> in the binary.</p>

<p>To convert raw machine code into assembly language, you need to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disassembler">disassembler</a>. In practice, a good disassembler will do a lot more than just displaying the bytes in a different way - it will also do its best to ensure that it only does that on bytes that represent machine code. That&#39;s trickier than it sounds.</p>

<p>Hopefully this answers your question!</p>

<p>[edit: It&#39;s worth noting that the raw byte sequence of a given instruction (in this case, <code>B8</code>) is called an <em>opcode</em>, whereas the word that appears in assembly language for that instruction (in this case, <code>mov</code>) is a <em>mnemonic</em>. It&#39;s also worth noting that while each opcode will only disassemble to one mnemonic, the same mnemonic can assemble to one of many different opcodes depending on the types and sizes of the arguments that are used.]</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Chances are very good that you&#39;re not handling the null terminator at the end of your string properly.</p>

<p>All C strings have to end with a null terminator - that is, a byte equal to 0. When you reverse a string, you have to make sure that your string still ends with this null terminator, which you&#39;re not doing in the code you gave.</p>

<p>Remember, declaring variables doesn&#39;t automatically initialise them; anything could be in there, more-or-less. Perhaps your 8-character string had a null in there at the right place anyway, whereas your 9-character one doesn&#39;t. If that&#39;s the case, it could print a longer string than you intended.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>For each plate of pancakes x, we count the number of times we need to split it so that it&#39;ll have less than j pancakes. The time to eat all the pancakes is the number of splits we make + the number of pancakes a person eats. The number of splits needed for a single plate is (x-1)/j.</p>

<p>Ex: If j = 6 and list = [13, 6, 18, 100], then we&#39;d need to split the stack of 13 pancakes into 3 portions (2 splits needed), stack of 6 will remain (0 splits), stack of 18 into 3 portions (2 splits), and stack of 100 into 17 portions (16 splits). So the time needed to consume pancakes is 2 + 0 + 2 + 16 + j = 26.</p>

<p>In most other languages that use for loop structures, the same applies.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: A little bit of system explanation.</p>

{
     thing();
}

<p>So the i++ is handled at the end of each loop. Then it checks whether it must still do the loop.</p>

<p>As such, something like:</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &gt;= 0; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>is an infinite loop. Of course, you won&#39;t use that if you can much more easily go</p>

<p>Embarrassingly parallel problems (also called &quot;perfectly parallel&quot; or &quot;pleasingly parallel&quot;) tend to require little or no communication of results between tasks, and are thus different from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing">distributed computing</a> problems that require communication between tasks, especially communication of intermediate results. They are easy to perform on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_farm">server farms</a> which do not have any of the special infrastructure used in a true <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer">supercomputer</a> cluster. They are thus well suited to large, Internet-based distributed platforms such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BOINC">BOINC</a>, and do not suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_slowdown">parallel slowdown</a>. The diametric opposite of embarrassingly parallel problems are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inherently_serial_problem">inherently serial problems</a>, which cannot be parallelized at all.</p>

<p>A common example of an embarrassingly parallel problem lies within <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">graphics processing units</a> (GPUs) for the task of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection">3D projection</a>, where each pixel on the screen may be rendered independently.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Yes, I meant folders that are used by everyone. It would be a nice addition if every language had a public folder that contained all the notes from every user on that language.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>A lot of different philosophies here, but ask yourself two questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What data do you not want the user to tamper with or know the code off?
2.1 What tasks will take a lot of time to process?
2.2 Which of these tasks uses data that the user can tamper with?</li>
</ol>

<p>Answering these questions will get you a fair bit on the way. All the tasks that are done on the users own computer can be tampered with by the User. Javascript is completely open to the user and they can change both how the code works and parameters of the data.</p>

<p>For example: Say that you let the client machine do the password check instead of the server:</p>

<pre><code>if(password == &quot;letmeinplease&quot;) {
    sendMessageToServer(&quot;LetUserIn&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously this is a horrible idea. Not only does the user know your super secret password, even without a password, he could just change the code to this:</p>

<pre><code>if(true) {
    sendMessageToServer(&quot;LetUserIn&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or in fact just use the method sendMessageToServer(&quot;LetUserIn&quot;) and tadaah. The user is in. Horrible idea! Horrible, horrible.</p>

<p>But then comes the other issue: Let&#39;s say that you had a sorting algorithm and you wanted to sort a certain users whole Facebook-friend list based on their age. Should that be handled by the server or the client? Well... Say that it is handled by the server, and your service is used by a lot of people, that would mean a shit ton of your server&#39;s processing power going for this sorting. It&#39;d probably slow the server down and then you won&#39;t have a good time.</p>

<p>Is this data that is really dangerous for the user to know and potentially tamper with? The conclusion would probably be &quot;Nah. Not really!&quot; So if you set up a function performing that calculation on the client side, your server goes scott free from all that nasty n<sup>2</sup> (I have no idea if that&#39;s the big-O for a standard sort) problem processing.</p>

<p>TLDR: Any data or method that should be secret to the user should be stored, accessed or performed on the server. Tougher processing tasks with data or code that are not secret should be performed on the client.</p>

<p>Hope that answers the question!</p>

<p>It&#39;s an excellent and challenging course. I&#39;m a bit ambivalent about some other MOOCs.

<p>I would also highly recommend the Algorithms I and II courses on Coursera by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne whenever they are offered. They are outstanding courses and probably one of my favorite set of MOOCs that I&#39;ve participated in.

"<div class="md"><p>Almost always. GPUs are much, much slower than CPUs. A new i7 runs at something like 4.0Ghz, a new GeForce runs around ~1.0Ghz. GPUs lag one or two generations behind in fabrication technology. The i7 is 22nm, the GeForce is 28nm (and there is more to the manufacturing component than just this number). GPUs are more limited than CPUs - the i7 will have more complicated features, more of them, etc. So, to reiterate, in a general purpose comparison, the CPU will beat the GPU every time in every way.</p>

<p>However.</p>

<p>GPUs have one advantage: they are enormous. As we just saw, the i7 beats the GeForce solidly: speed, technology, feature set, etc. But, the i7 has 4 (ish) cores, while the GeForce has between one and four <em>thousand</em> depending on the model. And so GPUs are faster than CPUs when the number of cores can overcome the processing power disparity per core. Now we just need to know when that is.</p>

<p>More cores can only help sequential tasks to a limited degree. Inherently sequential tasks include: running a program (at least an ordinary one), parsing a text file, compiling, etc. Generally anything where some stage of the processing is dependant on other stages of processing. You can&#39;t easily cut up a source file to feed to multiple cores to compile, because the chunks are interdependant. As a trivial example, if one core gets a section of code with an opening code block (a <code>(</code> or whatever), and another core gets the next section of code containing the closing block (the matching <code>)</code>), neither can finish their work. They will need to go back, try a different section, collaborate, etc, all of which is complicated and slow. Meanwhile the much faster CPU just chews through the whole thing.</p>

<p>The point isn&#39;t to say that those tasks are completely impossible to parallelize. There&#39;s lots of work being done in parallelizing compiling, for example, and an easy way to start is by breaking up code into different files, etc. The point is merely that these types of problems are harder to parallelize, and that there usually are theoretical limits on how far they can be broken down.</p>

<p>On the other hand, more cores can help a lot with non-sequential, aka parallelizable tasks. Rendering is a fantastic example and is why GPUs exist in the first place: generally speaking you have thousands of pixels you need to render to the output device and they&#39;re typically <em>nearly</em> completely independant of each other (a pixel might affect an adjacent neighbour, for example in anti-aliasing, but typically no further than that. By contrast with the compiling example we had above, once we encounter an opening <code>(</code>, the closing <code>)</code> could be literally anywhere after it in the file). If you want to apply a shader effect to the whole picture, you just need to run a calculation on each pixel, not on the picture as a whole. Meaning, the many cores of a GPU can happily go to work on this problem and not get in each others&#39; way. (They&#39;re also often specialized for this type of work.)</p>

<p><a href="/u/wolfcry0">/u/wolfcry0</a>&#39;s bitcoin example is another good one. The GPU is good at mining because in simplistic terms mining just involves making lots and lots of random guesses. Because the guesses are random and therefore have no interdependency with other guesses, you end up mining faster with 4000 slow cores making 1 guess a second = 4,000 guesses a second than 4 fast cores making 100 guesses a second = 400 guesses a second (numbers completely made up).</p>

"<div class="md"><p>CPUs are optimized for generality — they can handle any task you throw at them efficiently.  GPUs are far more specialized, and they are only useful with certain kinds of tasks.  As a general rule of thumb, if you can decompose your algorithm into a wide batch of independent operations (e.g. &quot;here&#39;s 10 million pairs of floats, find the product of each pair&quot;) then a GPU will be able to tear into it.  Matrix multiplications and kernel convolutions are two examples of this kind of task.  However, if your algorithm cannot be broken into many independent calculations (e.g. lots of steps that depend on the results of previous steps rather than being independent) or require complicated logic (such as branching or decision making at each step), then it won&#39;t be suited for the GPU.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve purchased the book you mentioned and while I&#39;ve started it, I can&#39;t give you an honest opinion of the book. The problem you will run into using it though is that it focuses on using Eclipse over Android Studio. You will want to use Android Studio as it is now the official IDE for Android. That doesn&#39;t mean the book won&#39;t be useful, you will just have to work around those parts of it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography">public-key cryptography</a>, a <strong>public key fingerprint</strong> is a short sequence of bytes used to authenticate or look up a longer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key">public key</a>. Fingerprints are created by applying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic hash function</a> to a public key. Since fingerprints are shorter than the keys they refer to, they can be used to simplify certain key management tasks. In Microsoft software, &quot;thumbprint&quot; is used instead of &quot;fingerprint.&quot;</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Do you mean the fingerprint? That is a hash and it&#39;s used to verify that the public key hasn&#39;t been changed. You can read more about that here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_fingerprint">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_fingerprint</a></p>

"<div class="md"><p>A key might be identified by its hash, but that&#39;s only to give the user a shorter string to use for verification and identification, rather than the entire key, which is quite large.  (I.e. this is strictly a display/UI thing.)  The keys themselves are not the products of a hash function.  Hashing destroys information, so you can&#39;t just run arbitrary things through a hash function.  Hashing is used for verification of other things, but a key holds an identity.</p>

<p>XSRF tokens address that by having your back end include a token when sending something to a browser, e.g., a form to fill in.

{
int i, k;
for (i = 0;i &lt; strlen(before);i++)

int main (void)
{
int i;
char before[8], after[8];
strcpy(before, &quot;toronto&quot;);
reverse(before, after);
return(0);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Problem is when i enter an 8 letter word instead and change char before[8], after[8] to char before[9], after[9], it no longer works correctly. It only seems to work for a 7 letter word with the size of the arrays set to 8.   </p>

<p>e.g, when i run the program that i just pasted i get otnorot, which is correct. But when i change toronto to torontos and change the size of the arrays to 9, i get sotnorot@torontos. Why is this?</p>

"<div class="md"><p>IO streams are not copyable, so it would be impossible to <em>not</em> pass it by reference — that would be a compilation error.</p>

<p>Get in the habit of using const-ref for all parameters that you don&#39;t intend to modify, unless they are fundamental types (e.g. <code>int</code>.)  The point is to avoid the copy, and that only happens if you pass by reference.  Passing by const value is nonsensical because you&#39;re making a copy, which means the constness of the original value is irrelevant.  This advice changes if the function is a sink function, i.e. it will be storing a copy of the value, in which case you should pass by value, or overload on const-ref and rvalue-ref.</p>

"<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>So what&#39;s the significance of all this?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The same as the significance of the source code, but in machine language instead of in C.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what exactly can I do with this file? What&#39;s the purpose of it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can run it on the computer. It&#39;s a program.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is this how the machine interprets the program &quot;behind the scenes&quot; and sends it to assembly language?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here&#39;s how it works. The computer hardware itself only knows about binary numbers, nothing else. So all instructions that make up a program for the computer to run must be reprsented as binary numbers. The exact way to do this depends on the CPU architecture; each architecture has an &quot;instruction set&quot;, which is a list of all the simple operations the CPU can carry out, which binary numbers correspond to them, and how to represent the data for the operations to operate on.</p>

<p>As an example, a computer might have an instruction to add two numbers in memory. The instruction might be a byte with value 01011100, and it may be followed by the two operands in the form of four bytes each, representing the addresses in memory where the data are. Then there might be another instruction to subtract, another to compare two numbers, and a number of other similar simple instructions.</p>

<p>Because this is very hard for a human to deal with, they invented assembly language. Assembly language is a symbolic, human-readable, representation of the machine code. So the program that is otherwise just a long string of 0011001010101010100 can be represented as a text file containing meaningful strings like &quot;add sum, item&quot; or &quot;compare a, b&quot;, and so on. There is a one-to-one correspondence here between the assembly code and the machine code, so that you can have a program automatically translate the assembly code into machine code for you. So you can write programs in assembly, and then assemble them to a runnable machine-code program.</p>

<p>Similarly, there are even more abstract programming languages, like C, which allow you to write programs as even more human-readable text files, and then have a program, called a compiler, translate this code into machine code. In fact, for practical reasons, it it is common practice for compilers to generate assembly code, and then invoke the assembler to produce the machine code program.</p>

<p>In any case, the program file you are looking at with the hex editor is the machine-code program as prepared by the compiler/assembler for the computer to run. It contains the same information as your source code, but converted to a long sequence of &quot;add these numbers, compare these numbers, jump to this other location in the program if equal&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to make sense of it, then you can get a copy of the architecture manual for your CPU, look up the opcodes for all the instructions, look up the documentation for the file format the executable file is in (the file contains more than just the program code; it also contains metadata used by the operating system to load the program correctly), and set to it.</p>

<p>More likely, you&#39;ll have an easier time learning if you <em>disassemble</em> the file instead, back into assembly code, and read that. Or, like someone else suggested, tell your compiler to put the assembly it generates into a file so you can read it there.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>No, it&#39;s an RSA keypair.  The public half of the key is stored on the server (which is how the server authenticates that the user is who they claim), and the private half is maintained by the client.

"<div class="md"><p>So loop through printing each line of each array basically? </p>

"<div class="md"><p>Oh sorry i didn&#39;t add the button click event part of my code. So this will all happen when I click the button it should show them in a listbox sorted by the id. I just need to know how I can make the let object = data(1) run it through the method object(ref string obj) and return the name of the object.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>No, it doesn&#39;t work like that.</p>

<pre><code>for (i = 0;i &lt; strlen(before);i++)
    for (k = (strlen(before)) - 1;k = 0;k--)
        after[i] = before[k];
</code></pre>

<p>Since you&#39;re nesting for loops, the second for loop will run in it&#39;s entirety before the first for loop increments i.</p>

<p>So what happens is that for after[0], the entire second for loop will run before after[1] is processed.  The same thing occurs for after[1].</p>

<p>Visually, it would look like this:</p>

<p>after[0] = before[6]</p>

<p>after[0] = before[5]</p>

<p>after[0] = before[4]</p>

<p>after[0] = before[3]</p>

<p>after[0] = before[2]</p>

<p>after[0] = before[1]</p>

<p>after[0] = before[0]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[6]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[5]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[4]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[3]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[2]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[1]</p>

<p>after[1] = before[0]</p>

<p>after[2] = before[6]</p>

<p>etc....</p>

<p>This is why all elements of after would contain the first character of before.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>And one more question if you don&#39;t mind.   </p>

<p>When i make the string &quot;torontos&quot; instead of &quot;toronto&quot; and change the  size of the array to 9, it doesn&#39;t work anymore. It gives a weird result. It seems to only be working for a string with 7 letters with the size of the array being 8. Why is this?</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><pre><code>for (k = (strlen(before)) - 1;k == 0;k--)
</code></pre>

<p>This means set <code>k</code> to the length of the string in <code>before</code> minus one, and do the following if <code>k</code> is zero, then decrement <code>k</code> and repeat.</p>

<p>So it only runs if <code>before</code> is a string of length one, and if so it only runs once.</p>

<p>But why are you trying to use two loops for this? You need to scan through the string from start to end once in order to reverse it, and that&#39;s only one single non-nested loop.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>A few things are to blame here.</p>

<pre><code>for(k=(strlen(before))-1;k=0;k++)
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m guessing this loop is supposed to loop through all of the characters of before in reverse order on the same element of after.  Meaning that every element of after will contain the first character of the string (in this case r).</p>

<p>The second for loop is wrong for multiple reasons.  The biggest issue is the k=0 statement in the second argument.  This is always true since an assignment will return true, so the loop never executes.  Secondly, you initialize k=strlen(before) - 1 (which is 6), but then you do k++, which would run out of the array bounds.</p>

<p>Remove the second for loop and try again :)</p>

<p>your going from 0 to before.length, and each time going from before.length - 1 to 0, but your syntax is wrong, to test for equality use &quot;k == 0&quot; , as &quot;k = 0&quot; performs an assignment. in fact your inner loop never executes, so you&#39;re printing whatever random data is already in the &quot;after&quot; array.</p>

<p>You only need one loop to do this.</p>

<p>move an index from the first to last character of the before array. Then, transpose that index to it&#39;s reverse order by subtracting it from strlen(before)-1</p>

<p>You might want to make your arrayList a class-level variable.</p>

<p>As it is right now, you are only creating the arrayList <em>inside</em> the <code>viewAllFruit</code> and <code>AddFruit</code> (that method should better be called <code>addFruit</code> as per Java naming convention) methods and thus, you always have new arraylists and lose all changes made.</p>

<p>well, after you write the program in a language you can easily interpret (like C), the compiler translates it to something the computer understands. this is called assembly language. assembly language features very simple instructions (like adding or multiplying two values and saving the result, checking values of processor flags, and jumping to other offsets of the executable). so what you&#39;re essentially seeing are the binary - or hexadecimal - representations of the low level instructions and their operands. </p>

<p>one doesn&#39;t usually just read the file in this representation. normally, you&#39;d use a disassembler like IDA to translate all those 0&#39;s and 1&#39;s into assembly instructions. but when a program runs through a compiler, it usually employs several optimisations to increase the performance (things like for example checking first just one of the ends of an AND check - if the first one is zero, then it&#39;ll certainly be zero and the second part doesn&#39;t even have to be evaluated) so Assembly code isn&#39;t necessarily easy to read or understand. </p>

"<div class="md"><p>First, one must grapple with the facade of operator overloading. <strong>An operator overload is a plain old function declaration, but with a built-in name</strong> (i.e. operator&lt;&lt;) <strong>and a special way to later invoke that function</strong> (i.e. using infix notation). Keeping this in mind, you surely know that function declarations can be anything that compiles, and the compiler will happily use your hideous function declaration when invoked later, though it may not produce meaningful results when run.</p>

<p><strong>In C++, however, overloads of operator&lt;&lt; must take exactly two arguments.</strong> An overload of operator&lt;&lt;, being a function declaration, could conceivably take more than two arguments, just like any other function could be so declared. However, these functions would be second-class citizens, as the parser, preferring to rewrite uses of infix operators to recursive calls of the two-argument version, would never choose to call them. Since these deviant declarations would be mostly ignored, they were made illegal.</p>

<p><strong>Beyond the compiler&#39;s minimums, C++ is dominated by conventions.</strong> These rules are inherited from how the design of C++, the standard library, and the community generally have used C++. There are many books that go over these conventions, but Scott Meyers&#39; Effective C++ and C++ Coding Standards by Herb Sutter and Andrei Alexandrescu are two very good resources that cover many of them. In fact, some questions very relevant to yours could have been answered by them:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Why should an argument be passed by reference? Why should an argument be passed const?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Effective C++, Item 20: Prefer pass-by-reference-to-const to pass-by-value.</p>

<li><p><em>Another thing that confused me was that there was already code inside these files, unlike in C++ where you get a blank file and you type code inside it.</em> Well, you can get templates for C++ and you can start writing Java (or Android) from a blank file.

<li><p>Don&#39;t let people say &quot;X is bad&quot; keep you from learning a language. Every language has its place.</p></li>

<p>What&#39;s really happening is that the development tool is laying the groundwork for you, and many dev tools have complex menus for deciding which skeleton you want to use, if any.</p>

<p>A project from scratch, a new emulated device, up to a text input, a button and a simple result display.

The rest is just adding the rest of the text inputs and copypasting the calculate function.</p>

This means that in your Android code you can acquire the values using GUI, pass them into the function to get the result, and output them using the GUI.  If you wanted to move to JavaEE, you&#39;d just have to change the IO functionality rather than the logic.  This makes your code much more flexible.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Syntactically the languages are very similar. The biggest difference you will notice is how objects are defined and imported. Java also has garbage collection, meaning when you&#39;re done using an object it auto deletes it, Unlike in C++ where it sticks around forever until you manually delete it.</p>

<p>As for speed and memory C++ blows Java out of the water. Since C++ is directly compiled to bytecode and Java is run on a VM (the JVM) C++ is going to be faster by far. Its like racing a Harley against a Moped. </p>

<p>Java isn&#39;t as efficient in memory either. There&#39;s quite a bit of over head (extra space) created when making simple objects, such as a String, in Java,  that C++ just doesn&#39;t need. </p>

<pre><code>   class BankAccount;
   class CheckingAccount extends BankAccount;

<p>Now, down a wire you are getting account details which may be checking or deposit accounts, which you want to store in a list of accounts, but at compile-time you don&#39;t know which kind of accounts you are going to get. But you do have a function ReadAccount() which can read the wire data at run-time and create the right kind of accounts (CheckingAccount or DepositAccount). So, you create a list of BankAccount (superclass) objects:</p>

<pre><code>  list &lt;BankAccount&gt; accounts;
</code></pre>

<p>(note you can&#39;t use a list of checking or deposit accounts because you are getting a mix of both types) and then use the ReadAccount function to populate it with actual CheckingAccount or DepositAccount objects:</p>

<pre><code>  while( some_condition ) {
         Bankaccount a = ReadAccount();  // superclass references subclass

"<div class="md"><p>Sounds like homework to me!</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Looks to me like it&#39;s behaving as intended. </p>

<p>The AirJet default constructor calls the default superclass constructor, which prints the line &quot;AirPlane&quot;</p>

<p>A call is then made to AirPlane.tryMe() which prints the line &quot;AirPlane TryMe!&quot;</p>

<p>And finally, whilst still inside the AirPlane.tryMe() method, an IO exception is thrown.</p>

<p>Which is then caught by the catch block in the AirJet constructor, and subsequntly handled by printing the line &quot;IOException is thrown in AirJet&quot;</p>

<p>Although that isn&#39;t exactly accurate, it was thrown from AirPlane, and caught in AirJet.</p>

<p>Because the Exception, (or another Exception) is not re-thrown, the Exception is considered handled, and the catch block in main is not executing as there exists no exception to catch.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>This is kind of gross.  Let&#39;s trace through <code>main</code>:</p>

<p>First, it creates a <code>new AirJet()</code>.  <code>AirJet</code> is a subtype of <code>AirPlane</code>, so it must call <code>super</code> to invoke the superclass&#39;s constructor.  Since we don&#39;t have an explicit <code>super</code> call, Java inserts &quot;<code>super()</code>&quot; as the first line, and so the <code>AirPlane</code> constructor gets called nevertheless, and there&#39;s your first line out output.</p>

<p>The constructor goes on to call the static method <code>tryMe()</code>, which first prints your second line out output, then throws an exception.  The exception is caught by the surrounding <code>catch</code> right there, so it never bubbles up to <code>main</code>, and so that print statement is never hit.</p>

<p>I think my pancakes split during the special minute was off. I tried many different criterias, and also all together (effectively turning my fork-into-2 at each minute into fork-into-n at each minute). Still no solution. </p>

"<div class="md"><p>Print out the value of x and y just before the if statement.   If x or y are zero your array indexes will be -1 which is not good.  The same applies when x and y are at arraySize - 1.   This is why it enters your while loop.  The value at MazeRoom[ -1 ][ 3 ] is going to be garbage for example.</p>

<p>One suggestion would be to make the maze array two units larger in each direction and mark all of the edge elements as visited before you start at a position within.  If you do this you can get rid of all the if statements except for where you are checking for Visited inside the while loop and it should visit all of the squares.   You haven&#39;t really made a maze at this point, though. You have just visited all of the squares.  It&#39;s more like a flood fill.     </p>

You have 2 reference <em>per node</em>. Do you know the impact of the cache? Not to say linked lists aren&#39;t useful for some things, but you should <em>want</em> to use a linked list to use a linked list. </p>

"<div class="md"><p>Firstly, you&#39;re not in the same place; you&#39;re in a better place because you&#39;re writing generic code that can work with any kind of interface of a dynamic array.</p>

<p>Next, unless you are experiencing a noticeable performance impact, it&#39;s not important. Don&#39;t over optimize or prematurely optimize.</p>

<p>Finally, if you have a maximum size in mind, then the dynamic array will not exceed some constant (which some not very thorough Googing reveals the growth factor is 1.5) multiple of that size, so it&#39;s not like this thing is going to grow uncontrollably large. It&#39;ll waste .5*N memory.  </p>

"<div class="md"><p>First, Android Studio is the second IDE for Android development that has come out. Up until several months ago, the official development tool was Eclipse with the Android SDK plugin. It&#39;s very likely that the tutorials you&#39;re looking at are using the old Eclipse IDE.</p>

<p>Second, &quot;tell me how to develop an Android app&quot; is a very broad and unanswerable question within this subreddit. It&#39;s like asking &quot;Can someone tell me how to make a game?&quot;</p>

<p>Third, you definitely need to learn Java. Android apps are natively coded in Java. There&#39;s just no way around it. If you&#39;re a good programmer though, you should be able to pick up Java. </p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;d suggest first going through a primer on using the Java language. The core OOP concepts are still mostly the same - you just need to get used to the syntax and unique quirks of Java. After that, I&#39;d suggest looking up how to do a Hello World using Android Studio specifically. That should be enough to get you pointed in the right direction.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>This is nice. The problem with only this approach is you can&#39;t combine individual &quot;divides&quot; with the global reduction( everybody eats one in a minute).</p>

<p>So I got accepted with this approach. </p>

<p>Lets assume that there possiblily can be [ 1..1000] global reduction in the optimal solution. </p>

<p>So if x = 3, and there are { 10, 45, 64} pancakes are then, I will use your startgey to find the number of min number of divsion for each of { 10, 45 , 64  } no pancakes to reach either 3 or less than 3. And the total time would be 
3 + min_divs(10) + min_divs(45) + min_divs(64)</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Okay, someone in the #gcj channel explained it to me. You can&#39;t solve it by always splitting the stacks in half. In some cases it&#39;s better to divide into different quantities. For instance, in some cases for 9 you could do </p>

<p>9 -&gt; 6 3 -&gt; 3 3 3

<p>I think you have a misunderstanding on the cost of adding an element to the end. It&#39;s amortized constant time. The way resizing works is that a resize doesn&#39;t happen every time, it happens when you need to, and then the size is increased by some factor (like 1.75) which keeps it amortized constant time.</p>

<p>So of course, there are <em>some</em> costs to using this structure. But that <em>some</em> cost is the same cost you&#39;re experiencing when you check for <code>null</code> essentially. </p>

"<div class="md"><p>The problem I found was that it will enter the while loop even if every room around the current room has been visited.</p>

<p>However, I thought that if statement would protect against it, since it checks if every room around the current position has been visited.</p>

<p>I just thought of something else, would this if statement have to go inside the while loop? And then after I recursively called the function with the previous values, I would say found = true to leave the loop.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Using a structure like that means I get the overheads in processing and memory associated with the types. Arrays are very lightweight.</p>

<p>e.g. adding a new element (or pushing back and element) needs a resize operation being ran on the data structure each time which is costly</p>

<p>However, I do not know whether the cost of these overheads is worth it considering I will be wasting memory with the standard array.</p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Is there a reason you&#39;re avoiding a dynamic array kind of structure (in Java called an <code>ArrayList</code>)?</p>

<p>It would have all the benefits of an array except be resizable. Is this not exactly what you want?</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Consider the following case:</p>

<pre><code>std::string get_user_input();

std::vector&lt;std::string&gt; some_storage;

void some_function(std::string /* const ref? */ str) {
     some_storage.push_back(/* what to do here? */);
}

void foo() {
      some_function(get_user_input());
}
</code></pre>

<p>(In practice, <code>some_storage</code> would probably be a member, but it doesn&#39;t matter for the sake of the example.)</p>

<p>Here, if you make <code>str</code> an <code>std::string const&amp;</code>, the return value of <code>get_user_input()</code> will be bound to it and then a copy will be made when you <code>push_back</code> it into the vector.  On the other hand, if <code>str</code> is simply an <code>std::string</code> then it will be move-constructed from the return value of <code>get_user_input()</code>, and then you can <code>std::move</code> it to <code>push_back</code>.  That means that rather than performing a copy, you perform a move, which saves you an allocation.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>What languages do you know? It&#39;s fairly easy to write something that&#39;ll do that in most languages, using libraries like Nokogiri, Beautiful Soup, or Mechanize. I&#39;m not sure of any already-existing tools for the job, though.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t know any languages/don&#39;t write it yourself, just PM me the details of it and I&#39;ll see if I can write you up something.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m also interested to see the correct solution. I wrote my solution quickly, but spent a huge amount of time trying to understand why my answer was judged incorrect. In the end, I just gave up because I couldn&#39;t find a case where the output was wrong according to my understanding of the problem,</p>

<p>Here are my assumptions:</p>

<p>a) There&#39;s no point in ever moving pancakes to a non-empty plate.</p>

<p>b) There&#39;s no point in moving any amount of pancakes except half of a stack to a new plate.</p>

<p>b) Moving pancakes one minute, then eating one minute is equivalent to eating, then moving.</p>

<p>d) Because of this, you can do all moves in sequence at the beginning.</p>

<p>e) The time until the end of the breakfast is the number of moves you have made, plus the number of pancakes in the largest stack.</p>

<p>So, my  approach was to look at the stack with the most pancakes in it and move half of them to a new plate. I had code with early exit checks in it, but I also made a version that repeated this until all the stacks had 1 pancake in them and kept track of the minimum cost up to that point. </p>

<p>The output from both programs was identical according to diff, so something must be incorrect in my assumptions or understanding of the problem.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>I would start learning an Object-Oriented language right away. Either Javascript, Ruby, or PHP. Those are popular among web developers.

<p>This means that if you have a function that runs a loop and you put &quot;return x&quot; inside the body of your loop, the first time your code hits the line with &quot;return&quot; it&#39;s going to bounce out of the function completely and continue on the next line after the function was called.</p>

<p>best_time(5) = min(max(best_time(i),best_time(5-i)) with i going from 1 to 2.

"<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response! :) My idea was more along the lines of something that basically showed the same information to all the people visiting the website. For example if there was this main &quot;thing&quot; which generated all the strings, and the website acted more as a &quot;display&quot;. (probably a very shitty way of explaining it) The website wouldn&#39;t generate user-speficic strings but generate a string that would be &quot;updated&quot; to everyone viewing the site.

"<div class="md"><p>Why would you say that? On the return I see a purpose for returning a copy, as you may get a compiler optimization where it places the return value into object you&#39;d typically place a copy. </p>

<p>On the other hand I&#39;ve heard of no such optimization for copying arguments into members. And I can promise you that changing those functions to taking const references did reduce on copies which is a huge win when using things like std::string where you&#39;ll probably be newing it every time. Our uses of new and delete from instances like this alone were taking up about 60% of our runtime. When changed it went down to something like 6%. </p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re using some random number generator to generate random strings, right? Well, in vanilla JS there is no way to guarantee that each user will have the same experience with a random number generator. However, there are <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/seedrandom">libraries</a> that give you a seeded random number generator, and if you seed it the same for every user (Just make it static), every user will have the same experience.</p>

<p>An easy way to do this is the <code>setTimeout(fn)</code>: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setInterval</a></p>

<p>In short, you can do something like...</p>

<pre><code>setInterval(function() {
   generateRandomSeed();
}, 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>Or, if it&#39;s just a single function call in your anonymous function in setInterval, you can also do </p>

<pre><code>setInterval(generateRandomSeed, 1000);
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is it runs the generateRandomSeed (your function that you make, or you can call it whatever you&#39;re currently doing on button press) every 1000 ms (or 1 second).</p>

"<div class="md"><p>That&#39;s one of the reasons I never regret when 1 and a half year ago I decided I wanted to learn how to code. At first I wanted to be able to develop my own ideas, instead of being that &quot;idea guy&quot; which has nothing to contribute. </p>

<p>Also, I saw in the future it was gonna be an important skill, specially after watching videos like this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKIu9yen5nc</a> In my country, some schools have already began giving coding lessons to kid.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>I think you&#39;re correct and the line I mentioned is fine. The problem is probably the subsequent line.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>By the definition it skips the line, although it doesn&#39;t skip <em>reading</em> the line.<br/>
In most cases, whatever fancy functions you use will do precisely this, although it would be possible to skip <em>without</em> reading the lines if you just seeked a position in a file (don&#39;t know how that is called in C#), for which you would have to seek a certain position in <em>bytes</em>, which means you don&#39;t know what a line actually is (you would have to read a new line character to know that), so all lines would have to have the same fixed length.<br/>
To sum it, if you have lines with dynamic length, you won&#39;t <strong>probably</strong> find more effective solution, but if you have lines of a given length, you can use seek on the input stream.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>A couple other things, consider also taking things heavier than say 64 bytes, and anything that has to call new for it&#39;s copy constructor, by reference.

After asking a friend for some help (I&#39;m still new at performance analysis.) he noticed that some of our most frequently used functions were taking std::string by value instead of reference or pointer. After nearly exhaustively checking all of our code, I eliminated this and other similar examples of flubs like this, and our engine is much more performant. It still has some issues, but it&#39;s well within the parameters we need for right now.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>I&#39;d just like to interject for a moment. What you’re referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I’ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called “Linux”, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project. There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.
Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine’s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called “Linux” distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>I&#39;d say you should look at how an Entity behaves with respect to the container (and other Entities). What can an Entity do to the container? Occupy a location obviously, move around probably, perhaps prevent other Entities from being in the same location.</p>

<p>Also, I suspect Entities will interact with each other, and that some of the interaction is influenced by their relative position on the playing field.</p>

<p>So probably you want an Entity to know what it&#39;s location is, and you want the container to know what Entities are at or near a certain location on the grid.</p>

<p>It stands to reason that each Entity that is placed on the grid has some data members referencing the grid location and perhaps other properties of the grid, and that each grid location has some data members referencing the Entities placed on or near it. </p>

<p>So I see no problem for Entities to hold data about the grid while at the same time the grid (or grid plocation, grid point perhaps) holds data about one or more entities.</p>

<p>As for your question &quot;should I call AddEntity() on the grid (or grid location) or should I tell an Entity that it has been placed on the grid (at a certain location): why not both? For some interactions, you will start doing things by looking at a certain grid location. For other interactions, you will start doing things by looking a one particular Entity (and it will want to find out about other Entities near it, so it must know how to ask the grid about that and the grid must know how to address that question).</p>

<p>As for the classes that must hold 7 +/- 2 members: meh. It is a guideline to be aware of, but not a rule that must be followed under all circumstances. It is much more more important to have a clear view of what an instance of one particular class is supposed to represent and name your classes with this in mind. For instance, a Grid will be nothing more than a collection of GridPoints. As such, it&#39;s main data feature will be a data member that holds GridPoint objects, and it will have methods to walk across all of the GridPoints in a certain order, while telling the current GridPoint under consideration to perform a certain operation (update itself and any Entity it knows of ?). A GridPoints most prominent feature will be its coordinates (x, y and perhaps z). It will have a list of Entities that are at or near it. Perhaps it will have some attributes describing properties such as the terrain (water, land, marsh) at that grid point that will influence how Entities can move.</p>

<p>So the important thing is to model the things (your classes) properly and what you want them to be able to do (the methods you can call on them: update, move, engage, add, remove, and, walk your list of X object and make them do something and so on).</p>

<p>In order to keep an overview of what is happening you need to give things clear, descriptive names. Don&#39;t be shy on lengthy names: MercenaryWarriorChief is perfectly acceptable if you want to distinguish it from DefenderFootsoldier and MercenaryQuartermaker. Some further naming tips: classes should be named after nouns. They are things. Compound things perhaps, but things. Methods on the other hand <em>do</em> things and should be named after verbs.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Windows is the most widely-used OS AFAIK, so nobody really considers &quot;learning&quot; Windows because they end up using it almost every day and are already learning it...they just aren&#39;t actively thinking of learning. As a result, you have a vast majority of computer users who only know how to dock/undock a laptop and send email. We in IT call these people &quot;end users&quot;.</p>

<p>Maybe expanded computer classes should be required in school. Although, some of my past classmates <em>did</em> have trouble with MS Word...maybe its asking too much for someone to add their own email account to Outlook, maybe I&#39;m just bitter.</p>

<p>Anyways, to answer your question, Linux usually requires more dedicated learning because it&#39;s different than Windows and requires new habits and skills that an average Windows user will not be familiar with. Think of it as a difference between learning a mostly GUI-based OS vs a mostly command-line OS. Linux does have better and better GUIs as time goes on, but the command line will always be the best route to be sure you&#39;re doing exactly what you want to do. Windows has a command line as well, but the majority of tasks can be done with less than 5 clicks, so it&#39;s mainly a question of complexity vs convenience.</p>

<p>I think this is different to money, because money is an exact quantity, while physical values always have an inherent uncertainty, and so the rounding errors because insignificant once you&#39;re using doubles.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>According to valgrind (which is a totally awesome tool for finding segfaults which you should definitely learn at some point) the seg fault is caused on line 39. Here is the relevant bit of valgrind&#39;s output:</p>

<pre><code>Invalid read of size 1
==927==    at 0x401138: generateFood() (test.c:39)
==927==    by 0x401215: drawSnake(bool) (test.c:48)
==927==    by 0x4013E9: initializeBoard() (test.c:74)

==927==  Address 0x605099 is not stack&#39;d, malloc&#39;d or (recently) free&#39;d
</code></pre>

<p>So main is calling initializeBoard which is calling drawSnake  which is calling generateFood which is seg faulting on line 39. </p>

<p>Line 39 is this (on my copy):</p>

<pre><code>} while (gameBoard[x][y]!=&#39;.&#39;);
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m pretty sure you can take it from here :).</p>

<p>Also I reckon sure something about this line is wrong in moveSnake:</p>

<pre><code>gameBoard[snake.body[0]/MAP_WIDTH][snake.body[0]%MAP_WIDTH]=&#39;.&#39;; //clean up the snake&#39;s trail

"<div class="md"><p>I &#39;paraphrased&#39; the real code. It&#39;s a bit more complicated than that.</p>

<p>The higher Entity Container has a Entity List of every entity ever created, it has oct trees per entity type for spatial look up and it also has a binary space partition for entity presence used by path finding. An item can be in the master list WITHOUT being in the BSP (e.g. the Item exists but it is in transit, in an inventory, packed away, etc).</p>

<p>I was kind of zooming in to the space partition section as technically, a bsp, is a solved solution that just uses areas and booleans, it needs nothing about an Entity.</p>

<p>My issue is, do I do Entity.AddToBsp(), which then knows about EntityContainer.AddToBsp(), or is it EntityContainer.AddEntityPresence(Entity)? Entity either needs a reference to it&#39;s container, which adds this odd circular dependency or the high level of what needs to call &#39;AddToBsp&#39; does.</p>

<p>I can forgive the EntityContainer knowing about the Entity, but somehow how Entity needs to get converted to be use in the BSP.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Essentially, yes. It&#39;d be more accurate to call Linux a large core on which other operating systems are built, but calling Linux an OS is close enough for everyday talk.</p>

<p>People say to learn it because a very large share of servers, development systems, etc run it and knowing how it works and what its common commands are almost inevitably winds up being useful. Not only will you need to know how Linux works if you want to deploy most web apps or write an Android app (since Android is Linux) but Unix tools (which are a big part of &#39;learning Linux&#39;) are so common and useful that a lot of programming languages have based part of their standard libraries on them. The large majority of developer tools are aimed at Linux, with often inferior or non-existent Windows/OS X ports produced as an afterthought.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>You&#39;ll want to get the print statements out of your calculation method, and instead return values from it. I&#39;m pretty sure with java you can&#39;t just create an on-the-fly data type.

"<div class="md"><p>Linux is technically an <del>Operating System</del> Kernel. When people are telling you to &quot;learn it&quot;, they&#39;re usually refering to the command line.

In addition, many tools are native to linux, so having a good working understanding is necessary for some projects or lines of work.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Reflection is a very non-type-safe and verbose way to do things, so it should be used with caution.  In general, reflection should be avoided whenever possible.</p>

<p>However, there are situations where you may need to use reflection.  Reflection is the answer to questions like &quot;<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/160970/how-do-i-invoke-a-java-method-when-given-the-method-name-as-a-string">how do I call a method given the name of the method?</a>&quot; (where the answer is &quot;you shouldn&#39;t do it, but if you must, use reflection&quot;).</p>

<p>However, though reflection is kind of magical, it still follows some intuition.  For instance, you still need to tell it what you want it to do.  So if you wanted to create a Java object, what do you need to know?</p>

<ul>
<li>Need to know what the object is (e.g. are you creating a <code>String</code>, a <code>Person</code>, an <code>ArrayList</code>, or what)</li>
<li>Need to know what which constructor to call (e.g. if there are more than one constructor, which of the constructors do you want to use.)</li>
<li>If the constructor you picked has parameters (i.e. it&#39;s not the empty constructor), what actual values do you want to give it (e.g. if the constructor takes an <code>Integer</code> as an input, what&#39;s the actual integer you want to give it)</li>
</ul>

<p>Line 82 creates a <code>Class</code> object for the given class (which answers the first bullet point).</p>

<p>Line 85 specifies the specific constructor you want, by specifying the parameters that it takes (answering the 2nd bullet point).</p>

<p>Line 88 specifies the actual inputs for the constructor (answering the 3rd bullet point).</p>

<p>Line 91 creates a <code>Constructor</code> object, which is possible since you have the type of the object (<code>c</code>) and the desired constructor for this type (<code>paramTypes</code>).</p>

<p>Line 94 actually creates the object.</p>

<p>Line 97 returns the object, casting it as <code>TheBase</code>.  Note that this assumes that the object you make is actually of this type (but there&#39;s no way to guarantee that at compile-time).  If you make an object that&#39;s not actually a <code>TheBase</code> object, you&#39;ll get a cast exception.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>I think, a problem here lies in your XPath expression:</p>

<ol>
<li>XML is case-dependent. So if your XML&#39;s book title element is &lt;title&gt; - you should write it in the code with the same case (Box[@id=&#39;1&#39;]/title).</li>
<li>by expression &quot;Boxes/Box[@id=&#39;1&#39;]/Title&quot; - XPath query can&#39;t get to your element. You should rewrite it either as &quot;//Box[@id=&#39;1&#39;]/title&quot; or as &quot;Language/Boxes/Box[@id=&#39;1&#39;]/title&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>P.S. And before asking for the &quot;.InnerText.ToString()&quot; I&#39;d better check if element is found.

<pre><code>var xmlNode = doc.SelectSingleNode(&quot;Boxes/Box[@id=&#39;1&#39;]/Title&quot;);

"<div class="md"><p>I prefer to term &quot;contract&quot; over &quot;blue print&quot; where interfaces are concerned. This is because blueprints are commonly used as an analogy for classes.</p>

<p>A contract makes more sense as long as we make it clear what &quot;contract&quot; means in a programming context. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Definition: Contract</strong></p>

<p>A specification that must be upheld by the implementation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So in other words, the contract says what our code must do. <strong>But it doesn&#39;t say how we must do it</strong>. So we could have an interface like:</p>

<pre><code>interface HasLength {
    /**
     * Obtains the length of the collection.
     */
    public void length();
}
</code></pre>

<p>And what it would ensure is that the implementing class has this method and it does what the comment says (which is our specification). For example, maybe a naive linked list would implement this like:</p>

<pre><code>public void length() {
    int length = 0;
    Node&lt;T&gt; currentNode = head;
    while(currentNode != null) {
        ++length;
        currentNode = currentNode.next;
    }
    return length;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And maybe a better linked list stores the size in the data structure so that we don&#39;t have to recalculate it every time:</p>

<pre><code>public void length() {
    return size;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Two very different implementations (one obviously more efficient), yet they both satisfy the specification and implement the interface.</p>

<p>Also, your statement about interfaces not having an implementation is incorrect for Java 8. Java 8 allows for implementation inside of interfaces and thus allows for multiple inheritance. When you implement an interface with one of these &quot;default methods&quot; (as they&#39;re called), you&#39;ll inherit the implementation from the interface just as we do when you extend a class. To avoid the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem">diamond problem</a>, if there&#39;s conflicts from multiple inheritance of these default methods, we <em>must</em> specify which we use.</p>

<p>For the most part, though, interfaces are used to show that a class should implement some contract (ie, it has these methods and they follow this specification).</p>

<h2>What if we don&#39;t follow the specification?</h2>

<p>You obviously don&#39;t have to follow it to a T. You can do extra behavior as long as you at least meet the requirements of the specification. If you don&#39;t meet these requirements, you&#39;ve violated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle">Liskov substitution principal</a>. I won&#39;t go into this as there&#39;s numerous resources to explain it and why it&#39;s important.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>I think the main difficulty (and the one you seem to be running into from what you&#39;ve said about being stuck on the post condition/loop guard) is that the way the algorithm is set up you need to be able to relate <code>t</code>, an arbitrary number, to <code>n</code>, the number of times your loop iterates. That&#39;s possible (I assume?) but significantly more difficult than the rest of the proof, especially since <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> seem to also be arbitrary. The easy part might look something like this (informal-ish):</p>

<p>Loop invariant: at the start of the nth iteration of the loop, <code>s</code> equals the sum of even terms to the (n+2)th term of <code>Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2</code>. (or, the sequence [x, y, x + y, (x + y) + y, (x + y + y) + (x + y), ... ]).</p>

<p>Initialization: prior to the first iteration we have <code>n = 0</code> so <code>s</code> is equal to the sum of even terms to the (0+2)th or 2nd term of the sequence, which is the sum of even values of <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. We can see from lines 1 and 2 that this is satisfied. (For now let&#39;s ignore <code>t</code> and the possibility we exit before we start.)</p>

<p>Maintenance: each iteration we generate the next element in the sequence. If the element is even we add it to <code>s</code>, if it is not even we do not add it to <code>s</code>, preserving the loop invariant for the next iteration of the loop.</p>

<p>Termination: at termination, by the loop invariant we have <code>s</code> = the sum of even terms to the (n+2)th term of [fib sequence]. ...</p>

<p>To complete the termination portion - and hence complete the proof - all that&#39;s left is to show that the (n+2)th term of the sequence is the largest element of the sequence smaller than <code>t</code>. But, as I said, this is the hard part.</p>

<p>You should try and figure out the part of the code where it occurs. One way to do so is to place print statements (eg, to stderr and redirect that to a file so that your console won&#39;t be messed with) all around the code and figure out where the segfault causes the output to stop. It should be between two print statements. So now you know the problem is on one of those lines.</p>

<p>If nothing&#39;s obviously wrong, you can repeat this (do bear in mind what kinds of things can cause seg faults) until you know which line causes the crash. If it&#39;s not obvious why that&#39;s the line with the problem, post it line here.</p>

<p>An alternative would be to use a debugger. Run it until the crash occurs to figure out what line crashed. You can debug by compiling with <code>gcc</code> and the <code>-g</code> flag, then run your programa in <code>gdb</code> (read online for docs for it, as it&#39;s a rather complex program).</p>

"<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not a unique feature to C. What you&#39;re doing you could do in pretty much any language (although you&#39;d assign <code>true</code> instead of incrementing).</p>

<p>Languages like C# and Java decided that conditionals should be forced to evaluate to a boolean for safety reasons. It prevents you from accidentally using some arbitrary variable as a conditional (which you can do in C and C++). It can help avoid unclear and confusing code. Eg, you must write <code>if(object != null)</code> instead of <code>if(object)</code>, which is somewhat less clear about your intentions.</p>

<p>Some languages take what you saw further by having &quot;falsey&quot; values. For example, in JavaScript, these values are falsey:</p>

<pre><code>0
NaN
&quot;&quot;
undefined
null
</code></pre>

<p>And everything else is truthy. So you can do</p>

<pre><code>if([]) { }
if({}) { }
if(&quot;Hello&quot;) { }
if(123) { }
if(function() {}) { }
</code></pre>

<p>And all of those will execute the conditional body.</p>

<p>Really the main reason for C&#39;s popularity is from:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It&#39;s a very simple language, which makes it easy to write a compiler for. Doesn&#39;t necessarily make it easy to learn, though. It&#39;s got a very weak standard library, tons of undefined behavior, and plenty of ways to create unreadable syntax. Python is much easier to learn despite being a more complicated language. The reason we want it to be easy to write a compiler is because you have to work with some new architecture, you don&#39;t want to write assembly all the time. 99.9% of programmers will never do this.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s a very low level language. It&#39;s referred to as &quot;portable assembly&quot;. Stuff like memory access is necessary for systems programming, and many languages cannot do this (because it&#39;s not needed for most kinds of programming).</p></li>
<li><p>The low level aspect can make it very fast. But frankly, there&#39;s almost no reason to use it for performance alone. C++ can attain roughly equivalent performance with a lot more features and a much better standard library (I mean, come on, there isn&#39;t even a proper string type in C!).</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s a good education language because it&#39;s relatively simple and low level. Makes it good for teaching about memory. As a result, it&#39;s used as a first language sometimes. And it&#39;s very common for OS classes to use C (even though C++ would work just as well). This is probably largely inspired by the Linux kernel, which is written in C.</p></li>

But your question says, you know it&#39;s getting into an infinite loop but you don&#39;t know why. That&#39;s different - that&#39;s something you should be able to answer entirely yourself without help.</p>

<p>The goal of debugging is to figure out exactly what the program is doing and how that differs from what you wanted it to do. If you&#39;re still stuck, then you&#39;ll have a very different question to ask - like &quot;why does statement x do y instead of z&quot; or &quot;how can I prevent an endless loop caused by (an exact reason)&quot;?</p>

<p>The first thing I&#39;d recommend is to learn to use a debugger. If you&#39;re using Visual Studio, you can use that built-in debugger, otherwise if you&#39;re using gcc or llvm I&#39;d recommend learning gdb or lldb, respectively.</p>

<p>Learning to use a debugger is not rocket science. Any online tutorial will get you up and running in maybe only 15 minutes. It&#39;s an absolutely critical tool for every programmer to understand and use, right up there with revision control.</p>

<p>The first thing I&#39;d try with a debugger would be to run the program for a few seconds, then halt it (Ctrl+C, or &quot;Break&quot; if you have a graphical debugger) and then print a stack trace to see where in the program you are. Print out some variables and try to figure out why it&#39;s still busy after running for several seconds when it should have finished in a tenth of a second or less.</p>

<p>Now, there&#39;s another way to debug that&#39;s also equally valid and that&#39;s log-style debugging. The idea here is that you add printf statements to your code to check what it&#39;s doing, then run the program and trace through your prints to see what it&#39;s really doing vs what you think it should do.</p>

<p>If you do debugging by logging (printing), here are some tricks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Instead of calling printf directly, write a function or macro called log() or something like that. Then when you fix the bug, just make log() do nothing rather than deleting all of the print statements.</li>
<li>Consider finding an existing logging library to get even more features for things like that</li>
<li>Learn to run your program and redirect output to a file, that can make going through the logs easier</li>
</ul>

<p>The most important thing to do with either style of debugging is to not make assumptions! Don&#39;t try to guess why your program isn&#39;t working, start at the top and check every assumption one at a time. What you want to do is find the <em>first</em> instance where you thought it&#39;d do one thing but it actually did something else. That place might be totally different than where you expected it to be.</p>

<p>One last tip: experienced programmers make almost as many errors as junior programmers when implementing an algorithm like this. The difference is that experienced programmers <em>expect</em> themselves to make errors and code defensively. For example, I&#39;d probably add logging statements as I write the code, assuming I&#39;m probably going to need them because a program longer than ~10 lines <em>never</em> works perfectly the first time.</p>

<p>You can also add &quot;assertions&quot;, which are statements that only print if they&#39;re false. For example, you could assert that x and y are &gt;= 0 at the top of the function - that seems obvious but if it were ever to be not true, it&#39;d immediately cause the assertion to print and then the program would exit.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve figured out <em>why</em> your program loops, or doesn&#39;t work as intended, feel free to post back with more questions. Just try really hard to figure out <em>why</em> yourself rather than letting somebody give you a hint. It&#39;s an incredibly valuable skill!</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Functional Dependency is the right keyword here. But IMO saying A is a subset of C is a little off-base.</p>

<hr/>

<p>In this case the relation schema is the set of attributes <code>A B C</code> along with the given functional dependencies.</p>

<p>Each tuple (or row) in the relation is an ordered set of three elements corresponding to A, B, and C.</p>

<p>The functional dependency A → C means that you&#39;ll never have &quot;different&quot; C&#39;s for the same A. In other words for any variables <code>a1</code>, <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code> there are no two rows such that:</p>

<pre><code>a1 _ c1
a1 _ c2
</code></pre>

<p>For example, you could have a table with three rows that looks something like this:</p>

<pre><code>A  B  C
--------
a1 b1 c1
a1 b2 c1
a2 b3 c2
</code></pre>

<p>Which would be OK because neither the A → C or B → C dependencies are violated.</p>

<p>Incidentally this example also disproves the A → B dependency by counter-example (can you see why?), and could be expanded on with a couple more rows to disprove the B → A dependency as well.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>The thing about programming is that you will never know everything about a certain language. For example, in java, people keep adding classes and interfaces and there are so many to start with that you don&#39;t just learn a language and move on to another. </p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>In math, a function is a thing that takes in input and returns output.</p>

<p>In programming, you can do the same thing.  You can write a function that takes in input and returns output.  For instance, you could write a square function.</p>

<pre><code>int square(int x) {
    return x * x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Functions in programming differ from functions in math in some ways though -- in programming, functions may also have side-effects.  That is, in addition (or instead of) returning a value, they could also modify the state of the program.  Thus, some functions return <code>void</code> (but are still useful because they perform side-effects, despite returning no value).</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Say I&#39;m writing a program that calculates factorials. Well, I could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int main()
{
      int n;
      std::cin &gt;&gt; n;

      int fact = 1;
      for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; i++)
          fact *= i;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works. But what if I need to find the factorial of 500 different numbers? Than, that would be lots of copying and pasting. So, I use a function to do it instead:</p>

<pre><code>int factorial(int n)
{
    int fact = 1;
    for (int i = 1; i &lt;= n; ++i) // I prefer a recursive method usually, but this works
        fact *= i;
   return fact;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I can call the factorial function a lot more easily than it would be to copy-paste the code inside of it repeatedly. And the point of it is that is returns a value which can be used. In this example, it returns an int. But it could also return a bool (i.e. does this equal this), a string (i.e. convert number to string), anything else, or nothing at all. Functions return values because functions can calculate things (you return the result of the calculation) or they fetch a piece of information (you return the information you were looking for; for example, a function to find the nth vowel of a string).</p>

"<div class="md"><p>If you realize that the optimal solution will always distribute pancakes first and then eat them it gets a lot easier. The  time then becomes number of distributions multiplied by the maximum amount of pancakes left afterwards. </p>

<p>The solution then becomes checking all possible amounts of pancakes left after the distributions (1-1000) and add that to the number of distributions needed to get the count that low. You can divide the number of pancakes on a plate by <em>k</em> in <em>k-1</em> moves so it is an easy number to calculate. This algorithm will at most take 1000*1000 (number of plates times number of limits to check) steps on the large set so it goes really fast. </p>

</blockquote>

<p>Therefore if you have one plate with <em>k</em> pancaces and move <em>k-1</em> of them to another plate then the other plate will still take <em>k-1</em> minutes to empty.

<p>Using JPA (an ORM for Java), the code would look more like <a href="http://www.objectdb.com/java/jpa/persistence/store">this</a> (look at the first code snippet).

"<div class="md"><p>You are aware that under all the pretty graphics, Mac OS X is basically a form of UNIX, right?  Like Linux and FreeBSD, which share a significant amount of DNA, it uses Python for some of the underlying scripts that take care of business behind the scenes.  </p>

<p>There has been a bit of a schism in the Python world... a number of years back, version 3 was released.  Mostly back compatible, but there were some significant changes that were not.  As a result, some scripts that worked perfectly fine under Python version 2, or 2.x, do not work under 3.x.  It has taken years (literally) for 3.x to reach the point of saturation to where a) more and more of the system programs that were written in 2.x are finally being ported to 3.x, and b) some Linux distros are starting to look at packaging python 3.x <em>only</em> in their newest releases.  For long-term support reasons though, python 2.x will be with us for a very long time - at least another 5-10 years minimum.  How does that apply to you on a Mac?  Well, being a commercial product, I&#39;m guessing they are going the conservative route.  No idea when they plan on migrating to python 3.x for the system - probably when python 4.x comes out ;)</p>

<p>Writing out Java or C# on paper and trying to make sure it&#39;s going to be correct is goddamn awful. I don&#39;t think they were that strict on the syntax (since they&#39;d be giving it a visual run over and not writing it out and testing) but it was still ugh.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Those aren&#39;t shell errors. Those are Python errors. You&#39;ll get those errors whether you use an IDE or not.</p>

<p>You&#39;re getting errors because you&#39;re capitalizing words. Python is case sensitive. This will happen in the IDE, too. Then last error is because you have a <code>]</code> at the end of the line.</p>

<p>You can type multiple lines. It&#39;s just that each line is evaluated as you type. That&#39;s because you&#39;ve launched the Python interpreter. That&#39;s how it works. When you go into a new scope (by indenting), you&#39;d be able to type the entire scope before it&#39;ll be evaluated. This behavior is incredibly useful for learning because you can quickly start writing code and can use it to toy with new ideas. You won&#39;t write serious code this way.</p>

<p>If you want to write a bunch of code, run it, make changes, etc, put the code in a file and run that with <code>python filename.py</code>. That&#39;s the &quot;normal&quot; way to write Python code. Whenever you download some Python script, that&#39;s how you&#39;ll run it.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>$ python3
Python 3.2.5 (default, Jul 25 2014, 14:13:17)
[GCC 4.8.3] on cygwin
Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
Hello, World!
&gt;&gt;&gt; name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
What is your name? Mike
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;)
Hello, Mike!
&gt;&gt;&gt; def square(x):
...     return x * x
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; square(4)
16
&gt;&gt;&gt; square(1000)
1000000
</code></pre>

<p>Only the first line (the <code>python3</code>) is a shell command. Everything else is run by the Python interpreter. IDEs can do this too.</p>

<p>The only thing is, it is complicated. All real software is. The division of XML and Java code confuses a lot of new people, but it is a better system. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be discouraged from Android. You can build a &quot;save this text to a server&quot; app in an hour, with zero Android experience. You just need a tutorial on the lifecycle, XML, and deployment procedure, most of which Android studio automates anyway</p>

"<div class="md"><p>The last two sentences are exactly why I chose to be a computer science major!</p>

<p>Congrats though, and keep it up. It truly IS a useful skill.</p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>It is pretty complicated but Android Studio makes it a hell of a lot easier to get it going. If you want to make it pretty and customize things, well, that&#39;s another story. Also, debugging and optimization are a pain in the ass. </p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re looking to put it in the Play Store there are a lot of best practices/guidelines and such. </p>

<p>I&#39;d say for something like you are doing it wouldn&#39;t be that bad. Just make sure that you learn and understand the Activity life cycle and don&#39;t create memory leaks. I&#39;m too tired to Google this right now but if you can&#39;t find anything good let me know and I&#39;ll do it tomorrow. There are a lot of good tutorials online as well (CodePath comes to mind). The tutorials on the Android developer site are quite daunting so I&#39;d look at them but try to find simpler tutorials unless you need something in-depth.</p>

<p>Also, the emulator is really frustrating (although there is an accelerator that I cannot remember the name of atm) so I&#39;d recommend using GenyMotion instead. Eclipse sucks big fat donkey balls as well (for Android at least, might be good for other stuff) but I don&#39;t know if Google is even supporting it any longer. I haven&#39;t done much coding recently so I haven&#39;t kept up with that...</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Assignment Requirements:</p>

<p>Using the Java programming language, you are required to re-create aspects of the concurrent system used
to achieve robot functionality. The system should have the following threads:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Two threads to represent sensed data from Robot’s ears, each of which requires 20 bytes of RAM per second</p></li>
<li><p>Two threads to represent sensed data from Robots’s eyes, each of which requires 30 bytes of RAM per second</p></li>
<li><p>Two threads to represent sensed data from Robot’s hands, each of which requires 40 bytes of RAM per second</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The sensed data will be fed into Robot’s processing system so that appropriate responses may be returned to the human with which it is interacting. Your system should simply consume the sensed data.
You should also take into account the fact that the robot’s operating system is simultaneously supporting system activity and managing the processor, memory and disk space of the device on which it is installed.</p>

<p>Therefore, additionally create:</p>

<ol>
<li>System and management threads which, together, require 50 bytes of RAM per second, and execute for a random amount of time once invoked. This means that there is a limit on the amount of CPU and memory available to support system operation and
the jobs it is responsible for. A thread occupies a certain amount of RAM, and each thread must have enough RAM to facilitate its execution.</li>
</ol>

<p>In your solution, implement a buffer monitor and use get() and put() methods to control the data collection
and processing. Use calls to the sleep() method to introduce delays in the jobs arriving at the operating
system. Generate exit times from the operating system based on the duration of the session, and use this value as the value entered  into the bounded buffer</p>

<p>The program should run for a period of time to demonstrate the full functionality of the system implemented</p>

<p>This is the assignment brief. </p>

<p>And, now that I&#39;ve made something, I can&#39;t stop thinking of possible modifications I could make to the code, whether it&#39;s an expansion of the program&#39;s functionality and versatility, or a potential UI design for an implementation on smartphones. </p>

"<div class="md"><p>+1 on this.

Plus Anaconda comes with excellent support for PyQT (library for creating graphical user interfaces), most scientific/numeric libraries you&#39;re likely to need, and Spyder, a lightweight IDE that isn&#39;t too overwhelming.  <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> is arguably a better, more full-fledged IDE... but the learning curve can be a bit steeper as there is more going on.

"<div class="md"><p>Take a look at line 49:</p>

<pre><code> LinkedList&lt;MyEntry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt; bucket = bucketArray[index];
</code></pre>

<p>What this line is doing is creating a new variable called bucket, with its own unique memory address, and assigning it the value of whatever was at bucketArray[index]. In this case it would be null, since there are no buckets yet. You then go on to assign bucket to newLL, which is a new instance of LinkedList&lt;MyEntry&lt;K,V&gt;&gt;, and then add to it. This is all well and good, but what about bucketArray[index]? It&#39;s still referencing null! The only thing being modified is the linked list that is now referenced by both bucket and newLL.</p>

<p>To store your new list in the bucketArray, you&#39;ll need to perform an assignment operation on bucketArray[index]. I&#39;ll leave you with that and see if you can fix things up.</p>

The problem is to find the quickest way for all the pancakes to be consumed.

"<div class="md"><p>In the old days, there were a few uses as <a href="/u/prof_hobart">/u/prof_hobart</a> said. Today there are two places where legit code uses.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Runtime optimization, specifically, some apps will have functions that can be implemented 10 different ways, using various instructions (think SSE, and those newer instructions), they fall back to slower instructions. You could write a function that selects the right optimized routine, and call that from within your loop, but that requires a jump, and some decision logic, and you do not want that in the middle of your CPU intensive loop. Also not using these instructions will have a large impact on some apps. The solution is your write your function in every form (as separate functions). Then at startup, you check what instructions are available, and locate all the functions that need optimization, and copy paste the optimized code into the function. That results in an application that is not CPU dependent (you can actually distribute the binary), and it uses all those fancy new instructions that only 10% of your users have. I think you can get the linker to do this type of thing, but I&#39;m not sure. But it is common in things like video transcoders and such, since it actually makes a difference.</p></li>
<li><p>Runtime debugging and (re-)linking. I know the Linux kernel uses it for ftrace. They compile a NOOP near every entry point in the kernel. Then, without rebuilding your kernel, you can ask the kernel to apply some debugging function whenever accessing some kernel thing. The kernel just modifies itself to call ftrace when that code is hit, which does whatever. The result is a kernel with very high powered debugging tools, and essentially zero performance impact when the debugging tools are not used. They are extending this to perform kernel updates without a reboot. You load a new kernel, and then ftrace is used to call the function out of the new kernel from the old kernel. By doing that you can mix and match new and old code (allowing the kernel to switch to the new time at an appropriate time, since hardware does care).</p></li>

<p>Your equals method is comparing the Object parameter with a String, which is always going to return <code>false</code>, because a String can only be equal to other String objects (not to a Word object). Instead, you should check if the Object parameter is a Word (by using <code>instanceof</code>), and if it is a Word, then you can compare this word&#39;s String to the other word&#39;s string. </p>

<p>Also: Your MyMap class probably shouldn&#39;t even know about the Word class. There&#39;s no need to cast the key objects to a Word type. Just use key.hashCode() and key.equals(). This will let you re-use the same MyMap class to store any type of keys, not just Words. </p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>I highly recommend that you don&#39;t shy away from the terminal. It&#39;s not as hard or scary as you probably think it is. In fact, the basics (and you don&#39;t really need any more than the basics) are so simple that it&#39;s as easy as learning some IDEs (just <em>different</em>).</p>

<p>For example, you start the Python interpreter with:</p>

<pre><code>python
</code></pre>

<p>It might be <code>python3</code>. That&#39;s it. Easy, right?</p>

<p>To run a script in the working directory, you just have to run</p>

<pre><code>python my_script.py
</code></pre>

<p>Also easy, eh?</p>

<p>And to change the working directory, you&#39;d use</p>

<pre><code>cd some/path
</code></pre>

<p>The definition of the working directory is the same as in Python and pretty much every other language. But in case you&#39;re <em>really</em> new to programming, the working directory is simply the directory that you&#39;re considered to be inside. All programs have a working directory and when you try to access files, you&#39;ll access relative from the working directory. So if you&#39;re in <code>/Users/Spoonta</code> and you try to access <code>some_file.txt</code>, then you&#39;ll access <code>/Users/Spoonta/some_file.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Some useful ways to change the path include:</p>

<pre><code># Changes to /an/absolute/path
cd /an/absolute/path

# If we&#39;re in /an/absolute/path, this moves us to /an/absolute/path/foo/bar
cd foo/bar

# If we&#39;re in /an/absolute/path, this moves us to /an/absolute
cd ..

# If we&#39;re in /an/absolute/path, this moves us to /an/absolute/foo
cd ../foo

# This moves you to your home directory (special shorthand)
cd ~

# If there&#39;s spaces in the path, surround it with quotes
cd &quot;/stuff/Spoonta should learn Bash&quot;
</code></pre>

<p>And to see what files are in the working directory (useful for when you want to know if you&#39;re in the right folder), you&#39;d use:</p>

<pre><code># List all files in the working directory
ls

# Lists all files in some path
ls some/path
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, all those ways to specify paths that I mentioned in the <code>cd</code> examples work everywhere that you&#39;d have to specify a file or folder. This includes Python scripts. Thus, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>python /path/to/a/script.py
</code></pre>

<p>And then there&#39;s a number of options that you can add to do extra things. For example:</p>

<pre><code># The `-i` flag will run a script and then leave you in the prompt
python some_script.py -i

# `-t` warns you if you&#39;ve mixed tabs and spaces in a possibly buggy way
python some_script.py -t
</code></pre>

<p>Python doesn&#39;t really have nor need any command line options besides the name of the file to execute.</p>

<p>Why learn the terminal? Because you will need it. Plain and simple. You cannot be a programmer without using the terminal. I can guarantee you that you will eventually find a time in which you must use the terminal for something (or at least you&#39;ll only be given instructions for how to do something in the terminal). No sense putting it off. Get comfortable. The terminal is great!</p>

<p>And if you can learn Python, you can absolutely learn the basics of the terminal.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t need to retain data, you could simply have a single shared &quot;senses&quot; object that groups all the most recently read data. Make sure that access is synchronized and have the individual sensory threads update once per second.</p>

<p>The main thread that does something based on all the data read could use a conditional variable. Every time a sensory thread updates something, the main thread wakes up and checks if all the senses have reported in. If so, do whatever you&#39;re supposed to do with this 50 bytes and reset the &quot;senses&quot; object.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Very cool! but how thoroughly have you tested your program? I only ask because I see you are using doubles which are (while slightly better than floats) not quite recommended for precise mathematical operations. I&#39;m not sure how precise you care to be with your calculations but I can tell you any serious money handling program would not be storing values as doubles.<br/>
What you should be using (should you care to alter your program) is something like BigDecimal which is significantly more accurate. And you need to be careful on how you construct BigDecimal variables because it is easy to carry over the imprecision if you convert or construct from a variable type such as double.</p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>doesn&#39;t seem like you got my message. ok NP I will make the audience bigger</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Validating input is just one aspect of a wider category: being aware at all times of all the possible ways that a given piece of code can possibly go wrong.  Having a nose for this is an absolutely crucial sense to develop, because it helps you avoid bugs before they even exist.  For example, when defining the interface for a function or method, you should be thinking of all the possible ways it could be misused.  This function takes a string, what happens if I accidentally pass an empty string?  This function expects a list, what happens if I give it an empty list, or something that isn&#39;t even a list?  These assumptions form a contract, but one which is not always clearly defined.  Is the function supposed to check its parameters, or is it just assumed that the caller will know what is allowed and what isn&#39;t?  The latter is a valid stance in some circumstances, but such requirements must be documented and communicated if they aren&#39;t going to be checked or enforced.</p>

<p>This type of thinking has many forms.  What happens if this RE that I expect to match doesn&#39;t match, for some reason?  What happens if this function returns an empty list when I was expecting a non-empty list?  What happens if the response I get from the server doesn&#39;t contain what I thought it would?  What are the possible exceptions that such-and-such function is allowed to throw, and when?  What happens if a particular syscall fails (e.g. out of disk space)?  Should that be translated into an exception?  Or perhaps logged?  And who&#39;s responsible for that, the caller or callee?  Are we even checking the return values of syscalls?  And so on.</p>

<p>I find that this separates really good programmers from mediocre ones.  You don&#39;t even need to necessarily act on all these possibilities, and in fact you probably can&#39;t, because there are just too many of them.  Cultivating the mindset of being constantly aware of the hundred things that could go wrong at any point generally results in better code than when the only thing on your mind is the happy path and what&#39;s immediately in front of you.  Writing good code is very much about anticipation.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more robust to validate input, although if your API forbids invalid input, it&#39;s not technically wrong to exhibit undefined behavior if bad input is given.</p>

<p>An externally facing API (e.g. one that end users can touch via, say, a HTTP request) must validate input if it touches sensitive data.</p>

<p>Whether you should validate data for minor things (e.g. what if user passes in a negative value for the square root function) is really up to you; the real trade-off happens when the validation required is non-trivial, and the code would have to spend a non-negligible amount of time or memory to validate the input set.</p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Depends.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s something I&#39;m intending to use only a few times, is not important, and putting the wrong input is not going to cause any real issues, then no I don&#39;t validate.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s something I&#39;m intending to use often, if it&#39;s something I&#39;ll likely pass onto other people, or if it&#39;s something where putting in the wrong input will cause real world issues, then yes I validate.</p>

<p>Real world examples of both:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I wrote a quick program that would take improperly formatted code on <a href="/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> (when people asking questions would copy/paste code without the required four spaces before each line) and add the right number of spaces. No input validation because it&#39;d be very obvious if I gave the wrong input and even if I did, nothing bad is really going to happen. I can just rerun the program with proper input.</p></li>
<li><p>Back when I was a research biologist, I wrote a quick program that would take raw spectrometry data and convert it to the proper dilutions we should use for Western Blots. I validated all input because even though it&#39;s a simple number crunching program, I ran Western Blots at least once a week (often twice). On top of that, there&#39;s a good chance people other than me will be using it and improper inputs can lead to (literally) hundreds if not thousands of dollars wasted. That&#39;s not including the sheer embarrassment of potentially publishing a paper with very faulty data.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>THAT SAID, I consider myself an experienced programmer well versed in the languages I use. If you&#39;re still in the learning phase, I heavily suggest validating input anyways so you can become more comfortable with the language.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming fgets returns 0 if it doesn&#39;t receive any input from the user?

"<div class="md"><p>First, I heavily suggest getting used to Terminal. If you&#39;re going to be in programming, working within Terminal will never go away. It&#39;s the one ubiquitous interface you&#39;ll have between any operating system (Windows/Mac/Linux/UNIX) and many important tools are Command Line Interface (CLI) only, e.g. Git.</p>

<p>Second, your only two options are either to use Terminal or to download and install an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that has a GUI for you to simply run it.</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: Terminal</strong>: You can type up your code in any text editor and save it as a .py file. Text Editors can be anything from Mac&#39;s standard TextEdit to programming-specific editors like SublimeText or the IDLE editor bundled with Python. Once you save it, you can go into Terminal and use the command &#39;cd&#39; to go into the folder you saved your .py file. Once you&#39;re in the same folder as your .py file, just type the command &#39;python FILENAME.py&#39; to run your script.</p>

<p><strong>Option 2: IDE</strong>
You&#39;ll have to download an IDE to use. An IDE is a bunch of programming tools combined into one: Text editor, debugger, version control, plugins, etc. Most IDEs will also be able to run the Python interpreter graphically. All you really have to do is press the &quot;Run&quot; button after you finish typing your script. The only Python IDE I know of is PyCharm (the company behind it makes my preferred Java IDE), but there are other Python IDEs out there.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>You do know that fgets() retains the newline at the end of the input?</p>

<p>Also, your code seems a bit complicated. This is how I&#39;d write the thing - notice that the <code>count</code> variable actually does count the number of strings in the array, and so avoids possible off-by-one errors.</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

#define BUFSIZE 100

int main() {
    char ** strings = NULL;
    char buf[BUFSIZE];
    int count = 0;
    while( fgets( buf, BUFSIZE, stdin ) ) {
        strings = realloc( strings, sizeof(char*) * (count + 1) );
        strings[count] = malloc( strlen(buf) + 1);
        strcpy( strings[count], buf );
        count++;
    }
    for( int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++ ) {
        printf( &quot;%s\n&quot;, strings[i] );
        free( strings[i] );
    }
    free( strings );
}

"<div class="md"><p>I am going to use Java terminology in the following explanations, but these patterns can be used in any object-oriented language.</p>

<p><strong>DAO</strong>: 
A data access object is a pattern that is often followed when an application needs to interact with some persistent data store (often a database). The DAO provides a series of operations to the rest of the application without the application needing to know the details of the data store. For example, there might be operations to retrieve a subset of data, update the data, or remove the data. It is much more generic than ORM - it simply is an object an application uses to retrieve data. </p>

<p><strong>ORM</strong>: 
An ORM usually describes a library/API used to make interactions with a database more robust. Java has an ORM called JPA, which allows you to persist Java objects directly to a database without having to generate your own SQL statements. You generate Java objects (often called entities) that match the columns/tables of a database, populate the Java object, then called persist(object). It knows how to store itself in the database. When you query the database for data, it will return it in the form of Java objects, instead of the nasty ResultSet that you get when you are using JDBC with SQL.</p>

<p>In summary - a DAO is an object that abstract the implementation of a persistent data store away from the application and allows for simple interaction with it. A ORM is a robust library/API that provides a bunch of tools to save/retrieve an object directly to/from the database without having to write your own SQL statements.</p>

<p>EDIT: Note - they aren&#39;t opposing concepts (they actually go together quite well). It isn&#39;t uncommon for your DAO to use an ORM.</p>

<p>A schedule is made of up sections (eg MATH 105 LEC B2, CHEM 100 LEC A1, CHEM 100 LAB A4). So a Schedule class, then, might contain an array of schedules, <code>public ArrayList&lt;Section&gt; sections = new ArrayList&lt;Section&gt;();</code></p>

<p>You might also consider using a 2d-array for this, where the &quot;columns&quot; are days, and the &quot;rows&quot; are the 30-minute blocks, eg <code>array[5][24]</code>. Then, for example, Thursday&#39;s timeslots-array would be <code>array[3]</code>. </p>

<p>Depends on what you mean by &quot;general programmer.&quot; I know plenty of excellent programmers that have never heard of discrete mathematics.

<p>So, your web browser will request a page (say google.com) from google&#39;s server by sending an HTTP &quot;GET&quot; request. The server will respond with the page&#39;s HTML, CSS and Javascript, which then shows up in your browser.</p>

<p>My tip for you would be: Don&#39;t read any books, just dive into coding and solve problems as you encounter them, things will just start to get clearer. Also GOOGLE.</p>

<p>If you have any question I&#39;ll be glad to help you.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t stop after first crash.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t have a mac and don&#39;t want to buy one? Maybe rent a cloud server? Something like <a href="http://www.macincloud.com/pricing/compare">http://www.macincloud.com/pricing/compare</a></p>

<p>If you want to program for iOS on windows, an option might be Xamarin - they have an IDE (Not Visual Studio) and allow small programs for free (Size limit).</p>

<p>Xamarin, when VS2015 gets released, will have a free version that works with Visual Studio (Since VS2015 Community Edition will accept plugins) and it might be a better option to switch back to VS then, but that hasn&#39;t been released yet.</p>

<p>There are other options, but those are the two main ones I know about.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Big Nerd Ranch&#39; book for Android Programming is a fantastic introduction. There&#39;s a revised copy coming in August (?), but you can certainly use the existing version to learn the requirements to get where you want to be with this. Rather than use Eclipse w/ plugins as the existing text recommends, certainly just use Android Studio (which I anticipate the new text will adapt for).</p>

<p>Best of luck, cool to see this! </p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Thanks for the info. </p>

<p>That bus schedule app you created looks incredible. Did you have any programming experience at all prior to starting with Java back in December?</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>I had this type of &#39;problem&#39; when I first started out too. Whilst experience definitely does help, that&#39;s not something anyone can magically give you overnight. Like you said the main issue is when designing your own programs - looking and contributing to other projects on something like github and trying things out for yourself is the best thing you can do in the mean time. You will find that one day it just &#39;clicks&#39;, and things start making a lot more sense and come to you more naturally.</p>

<p>When I think of nice, clean, extendible code I usually think in terms of OOP (even when the language I&#39;m using doesn&#39;t really support it), since it&#39;s such a powerful concept. If you are going to sit down and write something that is going to take you more than an hour you should really consider spending a good amount of time on planning. It will save you so much time down the road not only in having to re-design sections of code when you hit a dead end but it weeds out a lot of &#39;hacks&#39; you would have otherwise done just to make things work.</p>

<p>When it comes down to actually designing the program you need to make everything have a distinct and clear purpose. So if you are creating a game character for example - it&#39;s far more beneficial, clear, and easier to extend functions like moveCharacterLeft() and moveCharacterRight(), than to have to hunt for the code that has it all slapped together in a tester function called isMovingLeft() full of nested &#39;if&#39; statements. Not only is more effort and bug prone to find, it probably performs worse calling isMovingLeft, isMovingRight, isMovingUp etc... every single loop. (That&#39;s probably not the best example, but you get the idea).</p>

<p>Sorry I don&#39;t have any books to recommend, and it might sound a bit cliché but I don&#39;t think a book will teach you these things</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>Hearthstone for example is made in Unity. There are lots of other great examples.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>First off, HTML is not a programming language, nor is CSS. Anyway, I&#39;m not exactly sure of what you&#39;re trying to accomplish, but I&#39;d suggest that you learn more about JavaScript. There&#39;s a JavaScript-library called <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> that may make things easier for you.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/31stxz/whats_the_worst_app_you_use_on_a_daily_basis/cq4sc2y">This might encourage you not to stop.</a> I started learning java in mid december and now I am developing an app for a local website (freelance).</p>

<p>Anyway, for example</p>

<pre><code> &lt;Button
     android:width=&quot;match_parent&quot;
     android:height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
     android:text=&quot;click here to xyz&quot;/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>would create default looking android button.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t explain now how you tie it up to your java and make it do stuff, what I will do is recommend you a guy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ef-6NZjBtW0">Derek Banas</a>.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t do iOS programming in C++.</p>

<p>X-code is free, and that&#39;s what you&#39;ll likely be using because for iOS development you&#39;ll be programming in Objective-C or Swift (or a combination).</p>

"<div class="md"><p>Yeah I have an iPad. Just downloaded Udemy and scrolling through the courses.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>It&#39;s true that unlike politics, law, medicine, or some other fields, computer science is very logical and requires little memorization.  Things work in logical ways.</p>

<p>I studied foreign languages (natural languages, such as Spanish or Japanese, not programming languages) in college and found that, although I really enjoy learning foreign languages, I suck at it.  Apparently, memorizing random facts/rules that make no sense is very difficult for me.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>First, if you still have some doubts about what OOP is about, have a look at some theory like <a href="https://thenewcircle.com/static/bookshelf/java_fundamentals_tutorial/object_oriented.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>&quot;Public&quot; is the accessibility level: from where you can access that method/property. If you had 2 classes, a private method could be called only from within the class where the method is.</p>

<p>&quot;Void&quot; is what the method returns.If you, instead of printing the values directly in the calculatevalues method, would return the values needed declaring &quot;public static double&quot; the method and add a &quot;return resultmole;&quot; statement at the end, you could print the result of calculatevalue in the main method.</p>

<p>Static is a bit more tricky, you need to understand first what objects and classes are. A static method doesn&#39;t need to be in an object but it can&#39;t access the object&#39;s properties.</p>

<p>I hope I&#39;ve been clear, I&#39;m pretty sure I wasn&#39;t.</p>

<p>BTW is avOgadro.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>I appreciate it, but yeah, it&#39;s definitely something I would prefer to dive into on my own. </p>

<p>How difficult is it to modify the UI of an app? I mean, for something like this app, it&#39;s fairly simple, although I would prefer not to have just a plain white background with small black text in the top corner. I would prefer to enlarge the displayed text across the screen, create fade ins/fade outs for numbers/values shown, change text color, create buttons, etc. </p>

<p>I imagine all of this is probably fairly intensive...it may be best just to start small by simply displaying/removing values from the screen...and then work on style later. </p>

"<div class="md"><p>If you can understand binary, do some algebra and deal with starting counts at 0 (ie counting tk 10 is 0-9), an intro CS course shouldn&#39;t be to big of a problem; I did horribly in highschool math but I&#39;m excelling in c++</p>

"<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re correct :)</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>You should never use string formatting with SQL queries.  It&#39;s imperative that the SQL driver does the formatting, not you.  The way you are doing it opens up the door to SQL injection vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>You need to read the documentation for whatever DB driver you&#39;re using to find out what <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/#paramstyle">style of bound query parameters</a> it uses and then use that.  Note that some drivers use <code>%s</code> which looks an awful lot like string formatting, but it&#39;s not.  You are passing the query parameters to the driver as a tuple, <em>not</em> formatting the string yourself, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>c.execute(&#39;UPDATE usrdata SET data_SequenceModi=? WHERE rowid=?&#39;, (&quot;Q&#39;(&#39;dam&#39;)&#39;LAAQLR)&quot;, rowid))

"<div class="md"><p><code>##c++</code> is for people who want to discuss C++.  In order to do that effectively, you need to be pretty good at it.  It isn&#39;t a channel for getting help about C++ or discussing code written in C++.  The ops are strict, and if you don&#39;t stick to the topic, you&#39;ll have a bad time.</p>

<p><code>##c++-basic</code> is a channel to help those who are starting out with C++.  The people there expect to have to answer simple questions and will be much nicer about it.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also <code>##c++-general</code> which is for everything C++-related.  Your mileage there may vary.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>A JNZ instruction typically does two things - it tests the value of the processor&#39;s Z(ero) flag (not the thing on top of the stack) and if that flag is not set loads the immediate (or other) value following it into the program counter, performing a jump. It is thus a combination of an IF and a GOTO.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>which makes switch faster than if else if... statement</p>

<p>If/else statements can also be implemented using jump tables, provided the conditions in the ifs is as simple as that enforced by (for example) the C switch/case syntax.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>You might find it interesting when you&#39;ve got some free time to check out the book &quot;How to make a game with batch commands in Notepad&quot; on itunes&#39; bookstore. It&#39;s only three pages or so, but you can make a text adventure game (you&#39;re essentially having a branching path of paragraphs through which you can tell stories with multiple choices) using the method they show, albeit pretty primitively.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a nice way to relax and practice writing, and could be something to add on your CV: &#39;I can make quick (admittedly very basic) games with naught more than my memory of some commands, Notepad.exe, some inspiration, and one hour typing&#39;</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>In languages like assembler, you could use jnz (jump if not zero), which checked the value on top of the stack and if it was non-zero (= true) it would jump to a label (so acting like a goto).</p>

<p>A different trick could be a jump table (which for example most c++ compilers use for switch which makes switch faster than if else if... statement), which basically acts as an array of labels, indexed by ints (cases of the switch, or in the case of &quot;if&quot; indexed by 0 (false) and 1 (true)). You can then use goto jmp_table[1 != 0].</p>

<p>Note: This is one big afaik.<br/>

"<div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right - this was more about altering it in flight rather than in the source code. I&#39;d assumed that was what OP was actually asking about, but re-reading the question, maybe it wasn&#39;t.</p>
</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>There is no way to implement an `if` statement with just gotos. This is because once you reach a goto there is no way to conditionally jump or not jump or jump somewhere else. It&#39;s unconditional.</p>

<p>On the assembly language level, a goto might be implemented with a non-conditional jump, while an <code>if</code> statement might be implemented with a conditional jump.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>dont worry about it too much right now; it will come around when you start dealing with multiple class and more object oriented.Basically the idea instead is that in your main you could instead create a neuro class  object via  Neuro aneuro=new Neuro(); which would call its constructor method(which you would have to create) which is not static and there you can do stuff) but you are just starting so its abit much at this point probably.</p>

<p>public static mean its accessible everywhere in your program without the need of a neuro object; even from other class.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t do it with only a goto. Early languages were not block structured (so they didn&#39;t have if/else blocks) but they did have if/goto.For example, in Old Skool BASIC:</p>

   110 PRINT &quot;X is greater or equal to 3&quot;

"<div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>its almost like it skips a frame occasionally and the animation becomes jumpy for a second or two then becomes smooth, rinse and repeat.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That jank is caused by the JS engine of your browser having to pause to perform a garbage collection.  Ideally every collection would take a few milliseconds and be unnoticeable, but occasionally they take a lot longer and cause you to miss a frame.  Browser implementers go to great lengths to try to minimize this, but it will always be present to some extent.  It depends a lot on the browser and hardware; I didn&#39;t notice it at all on your example.  The usual advice is to avoid allocating any new objects in your inner loops, but in your case I don&#39;t see that happening.</p>

<p>There are various benchmarks that attempt to quantify the problem: <a href="http://people.mozilla.org/%7Ewmccloskey/incremental-blog/example-pause.html">here</a>, <a href="http://v8.googlecode.com/svn/branches/bleeding_edge/benchmarks/spinning-balls/index.html">here</a>, etc.  Those are stress testing the GC of your JS engine, and ideally it would react with a bunch of small collection cycles, with no spikes of large collection cycles.</p>

<p>the stars that rain down occasionally flash to the top left corner of the screen...</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s due to this bogus test:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre><code>if(x &amp;&amp; y &amp;&amp; width &amp;&amp; height)
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In the case where this is called as <code>rain.draw(rains[i].x, rains[i].y, rains[i].size, rains[i].size)</code>, then if one of x or y happens to be zero by chance, then you&#39;re going to trigger the <code>else</code> of that above if-statement, causing the star to be drawn at (this.x, this.y) which is (0, 0) rather than your desired location.  You need to work out a better interface for this library.  At the very least, consider using <code>arguments.length</code> to detect whether you were called with four or zero args, but instead of that, consider making two different functions if you want different functionality.</p>

</div>"
"<div class="md"><p>If there is one thing I am still figuring out, it&#39;s the whole public/static/void/ terminology that comes before a method. I mean, I know that a method of the &quot;void&quot; class won&#39;t be expected to return a value. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not quite sure what &quot;public&quot; or &quot;static&quot; means before a method. I mean, every line of code here is contained within the &quot;public&quot; class I created (Neuro, in this case), and I&#39;m not really sure what the implications of that are. </p>

<p>All I really know so far in regard to those factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>public static void main (String[] args) {</em> is where the program starts. </li>
<li>Everything in the main function will be run. Everything outside of the main function won&#39;t run, but will be scanned - this is why methods are placed outside the main method. </li>
<li>Void class on a method means no values are going to be returned outside of the method. </li>

"<div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;re trying Freenode IRC.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to do it with a single file or process. I did it solely for the sake of laziness. I had a kernel that had to be compiled differently on every computer, and this was the easiest way to do it. I can&#39;t imagine doing it with a compiled program, unless you knew what the compiled binary looked like and knew a lot about the computer it was running on. Then, you could have it write over itself in ROM or RAM (if you know exactly what you&#39;re doing, down the bit), though that would be complicated to say the least.</p>

"<div class="md"><p>nice job. This should take way less than 3 seconds for something this simple by the way.Android API is kind of a pain to setup/use so good luck.</p>

<p>Now as far as the application: 
-Dont use magic number such as variable=variable *0.0001 ; the 0.0001 is a magic number you dont want that in your program.You can extract them away in a different variable with a meaningful name; if those value dont change during run time; use the Final keyword when creating the 0.0001 variable.</p>

<p>2: dont name your method parameter a,b,c;gives them meaningfull name; same with variable name.</p>

<p>Something like this would be better... </p>

<p>You should want to do this in three distinct parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get input</li>
<li>Generate results</li>
<li>Print results</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping this parts separate will help in the long run. Sooner or later you&#39;ll create different functions to take care of the different parts, but for now - imo - it just looks cleaner. Half of the battle with programming is keeping things clean and easy to read.</p>

<p>Also: Don&#39;t use &quot;magic numbers&quot;, instead move them into constants up top. This way your math statements almost explain themselves. What is &quot;0.0825&quot;? What is &quot;StateTaxRate&quot;? Which is easier to understand when surrounded by a pile of code?</p>

<p>In future just call that &#39;run the program&#39;. The Java compiler creates a bytecode that runs on the Java virtual machine, and when that code runs on the JVM that&#39;s when it makes the output &#39;Hi&#39;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although, I kinda get what you&#39;re saying. I know nothing of Python, but have heard it&#39;s pretty noob friendly, would that work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but only the same way Java would - your friends would have to install the Python interpreter. Python runs through the Python interpreter, Java runs through the JVM, but compiled languages can run on the machine directly. They don&#39;t need an intermediate peice of software to run the program.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m hesitant to start on C++, because I have a friend who started on that a while ago, got frustrated, then changed majors it got so bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well C++ is a massive language, yes, and getting into it as a new person can be too much I think. C is a much more simple language... in a sense. C still has a lot of things you need to learn, like manual memory management, and it has other difficulties that even experienced programmers tend to want to avoid, but it&#39;s easier to pick up C than C++. (And picking up C makes picking up C++ easier later on, too.)</p>

<p>If I were you and I were getting somewhere learning Java I&#39;d just make my friends install the JVM or I&#39;d just give up on giving it to them. </p>

<p><strong>Breadth-first search</strong> (<strong>BFS</strong>) is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">algorithm</a> for traversing or searching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_data_structure">tree</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(data_structure)">graph</a> data structures. It starts at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(data_structure)#Terminology">tree root</a> (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a `search key&#39; ) and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors. Compare BFS with the equivalent, but more memory-efficient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterative_deepening_depth-first_search">Iterative deepening depth-first search</a> and contrast with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search">depth-first search</a>.</p>

<p>BFS was invented in the late 1950s by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_F._Moore">E. F. Moore</a>, who used it to find the shortest path out of a maze,  and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery">discovered independently</a> by C. Y.
