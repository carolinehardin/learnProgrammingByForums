</div><div class="md"><p>Put together a program of your own. Tutorials will get you started, but you will learn a ton by making something useful and/or fun for yourself. My first project automating one of my tasks at work and it was a great learning experience. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmmmm. Fiddle around with it and make your own stuff? Its easy to get bored with some of the very beginning stuff in programming classes/books. You can supplement that boredom by exploring it and making your own stuff. Quick little dumb scripts.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Definitely do projects as you go. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with <a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler.</a> Maybe wait to try it out until you have the basics down, but it definitely provides a tangible goal for each project and will help you develop better coding practices. (Sloppy algorithms will take forever to execute etc)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You calculate <code>str(n)</code>, throw away the result without doing anything with it, and then try to loop over <code>n</code> itself.</p>

<p>And then you also do an <code>int(n)</code> calculation which is equally pointless.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re trying to iterate over an int, which is not an iterable. I suspect you think it&#39;s a string at this point, but str(n) doesn&#39;t make n a string. It returns a string. To get that string you would call str(n) like:</p>

<pre><code>nString = str(n).
</code></pre>

<p>n is still an int, but now you have nString which is a string, which is what I think you wanted. 
You&#39;re also never using adam, which means your code won&#39;t do what you expect. Also not sure why it&#39;s called adam.</p>

<p>Additionally, you cast n to an int (it&#39;s already an int), I suspect you mean to cast adam to an int and use that instead.</p>

<p>Also, you don&#39;t declare x anywhere, where is x coming from?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a more or less a total noob but I&#39;m gonna give this a shot anyway.</p>

<p>Try making a list first?</p>

<pre><code>def digit_sum(n):
    sumlist = []
    for adam in str(n):
      sumlist.append(int(adam))
    return sum(sumlist)
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I got carried away looking at the problem itself before coming back here, so others have touched on what&#39;s going wrong in your code.</p>

<p>On a separate topic, while the string equivalent of an integer will let you check the length in digits, you can do a more straightforward approach with some modulo 10 math.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is my solution:</p>

<pre><code>def digit_sum(n):
    num = 0
    while n != 0:
        num += n % 10
        n = n // 10
    return num
</code></pre>

<p>In the code you provided it looks like you convert &#39;n&#39; to a string only to try and convert it back to an integer immediately after, I assume to pull out an individual value from it.
Instead it is easier to define a new variable &#39;num&#39; under the function &#39;digit_sum&#39;. Then you can store the rightmost value in &#39;n&#39; to &#39;num&#39; by modulo&#39;ing by 10, then you can remove the rightmost that is now stored in &#39;num&#39; from &#39;n&#39; by floor dividing by 10.
So to sum that up, you chop the right-most number off of &#39;n&#39; and put it in &#39;num&#39;, then return the value in &#39;num&#39; and chop of that number from &#39;n&#39;, rinse and repeat until &#39;n&#39; has no numbers left in it.</p>

<p>The Q&amp;A Forum button in the bottom left is probably a better resource if you are confused, usually someone has had this issue before and will post a question or solution. Happy coding!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s &quot;essential&quot; complexity, then ultimately it just has to be dealt with. It&#39;s inherent to the problem. For example, if there are 100 independent conditions that each have completely different inputs coming from 20 different sensors and completely different actions, then there&#39;s not a whole lot that can be done.</p>

<p>Note that in the specific case above, you can kind of simplify it by encoding each condition into a bit, then using a switch:</p>

<pre><code>unsigned int cond = red | (blue &lt;&lt; 1) | (green &lt;&lt; 2);
switch (cond) {
...
</code></pre>

<p>Probably debatable though whether or not it&#39;s really simpler. Note that things like code coverage tools and perhaps other software engineering tools can help some with QA.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>First of all, don&#39;t be afraid to write functions for each of the conditions.  So:</p>

<pre><code>if (yellow &amp;&amp; !blue &amp;&amp; !green &amp;&amp; !red) {
  turnOnLeftTurnSignal();
}
if (yellow &amp;&amp; blue &amp;&amp; !green &amp;&amp; !red) {
  turnOnRightTurnSignal();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Even if each function is tiny, only 1 line, it still makes the flow easier to read.</p>

<p>Also, I like the style where it&#39;s a series of ifs, but not elses, and you check all conditions.  It makes it easier to debug.  That way, if you know the inputs, you can find the conditional block easily.</p>

<p>Using this style, this function becomes a router.  Based on the input, route flow to one or another function.  As the program&#39;s requirements grow, the complexity of the router doesn&#39;t have to (unless you add inputs).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That loop exits if at least one of the statements isn&#39;t true, since it &quot;breaks&quot; the conditions that both statements (AND) should hold at the same time. If you use an OR (||), only one of them has to hold (A <strong>or</strong> B has to be true)</p>

<p>Many universities have moved on to Python as a first language, and then teach C/C++ or Java in the second course.  This is a very sensible approach (and it&#39;s the one I use in my classes.)</p>

<p>Unfortunately, high school programming teachers do not have the luxury of flexibility nearly often enough. 
Programming teachers in most states get no support or training, and in many states, aren&#39;t even in the math or science departments, but business or vocational programs. Often the teachers have never taken a programming class at all, and very few are professional level programmers.  (The ones that are can make a much better and less frustrating living outside the classroom.) Many times the teachers learn the material the night before class, and often rely on students to teach themselves.  </p>

<p>Many high school programming teachers are excellent, but the system really works against them in the best situations. </p>

<p>Why is Java an Introductory language?</p>

<p>Because your class uses it as one.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And why is the course work ridiculous/useless?</p>

<p>Maybe because real life assignments are too difficult for people who are complete beginner?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>and they gave something like 20 of these statements casting back and forth and introducing new objects created and old ones and it was so fucking tedious</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe they wanted to ensure students really understood things, instead of getting lucky and guessing right on a question or two?  The point of a test is to see what you know, not to be exciting...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Then ask does the code compile?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If there are obvious errors you should be able to spot them and say so.  A lot of programming is reading code and seeing if you think it&#39;s correct.  You seem to be getting all self-righteous about nothing here..</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Its not a yes or no question. Its 4 Yes/No&#39;s</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They want to see if you can spot compile or runtime errors...  This is a standard part of programming.  You&#39;re just ranting that they want you to know the material thoroughly, which is ridiculous of you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is discouraging him into thinking he is a bad programmer when half the people in my firm wouldn&#39;t be able to answer this question.</p>

<p>Then those people lack very basic Java knowledge.  It reflects poorly on those people and your firm, not on this course, unless your firm/those people just don&#39;t use Java much at all, in which case it&#39;s no surprise they couldn&#39;t answer those questions...</p>

<p>I&#39;d be worried about that if I was working on the job and not taking a class.  edit: And then of course they&#39;d also not know much about inheritance, compile and runtime errors, types, etc. if you&#39;d designed the course as you seem to think it should be designed.  What evidence do you really have that they&#39;d be any better off, and not struggling more in the end due to their lack of knowledge regarding the basics?  Do you want all these kids to be hacks who can throw together a crappy PHP site but can&#39;t handle using other languages because they never learned the basics?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah as the other guy said the problem is with the course not the language. The work I had in my java classes (im in my 2nd one- Data structure) is at time difficult but very possible and manageable. </p>

<p>Java was originally intended as a sort of &quot;teacher&quot; language- a languages aimed to teach people how to program. Thus, it serves as a great introductory language. Also it is part of an object-oriented family of programming languages and has syntax that is very similar to other main programming languages. It has many possible purposes and honestly is a very good way to get an intro to programming. </p>

<p>Also I did take a course in java which means Im technically in my 3rd java course- but the course in highschool covered less than half the curriculum of the intro java course I took in college- it was very stress free. Anyways I think java is good. For highschool maybe they should teach python because I heard its easier to learn- but Java will prepare them for university courses just fine (And I&#39;m pretty sure its what the AP test for cs is based on). </p>

<p>Don&#39;t be angry at java. The questions you posted in the example are things that I&#39;ve never seen at the highschool level. Hopefully they are also creating cool projects like I did in highschool (simple and easy ones- but still satisfying for an intro programmer). </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll give you a hint. Put a print statement when you detect a collision, and print out the balls that are colliding.</p>

<p>Also, as an aside, using x and y as indices in your for loops is very confusing. :-)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you haven&#39;t read the FAQ, read that first. Then if you still have questions, come back, but try to be a bit more specific as to your goals, or what you want to do with your programming skills.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not a guru, but a quick solution would be to have Monkey, Elephant, etc. subclass Animal. Or maybe an interface would be more appropriate.</p>

<p>You could also do Cage&lt;Object&gt;[10], (I&#39;m pretty sure, anyway), but you really shouldn&#39;t. </p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>Cage&lt;T&gt;     
</code></pre>

<p>T is not exactly a wildcard in this case. <code>T</code> means that we can choose whatever type animal the Cage will hold, but they all will have to be <em>of the same type</em> (or at least, extend the same superclass or implement the same interface). If we choose T to be &quot;Monkey&quot;, that one instance of Cage will only be able to hold monkeys. If we choose T to be &quot;String&quot;, that instance of Cage will only be able to hold Strings. That way you won&#39;t have to make a different Cage class for each animal. You create one common container class Cage and <em>parametrize</em> it (or make it &quot;generic&quot;) using <code>T</code> as a placeholder for the future type of an animal its instances will hold.    </p>

<p>To limit a particular Cage <em>instance</em> (not the class itself!)  to hold animals only, you can do this:    </p>

<pre><code>Cage&lt;IAnimal&gt; animals = new Cage&lt;IAnimal&gt;();    
</code></pre>

<p>where IAnimal is an interface that all your animals implement (or alternatively, a superclass Animal that they extend). Then later you will be able to add instances of all Animal subclasses to it with no problem.    </p>

<p>(By the way, Cage is supposed to be a <em>container</em> itself. You implement it using an array or ArrayList, and use <code>add()</code> or <code>put()</code> to add elements to it. <code>new Cage&lt;Animal&gt;[10]</code> means &quot;make an array of 10 Cages&quot; which is not what the problem statement says (besides it&#39;s illegal, see below). This is the correct way to implement it:    </p>

<pre><code>class Cage&lt;T&gt; {    
    private ArrayList&lt;T&gt; animals;    
    private int size;    

   public Cage(int n) {    
       this.size = n;    
       this.animals = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;(size);    
   }    

   public void put(T animal) {   
        animals.add(animal);    
    }    

    //other methods, &quot;get&quot;, &quot;size&quot;, &quot;getAll&quot;, etc.     
}    
</code></pre>

<p>2) <code>T</code> and arrays. Ugh. <em>tl:dr</em> - don&#39;t do it. At least for now. Generics don&#39;t play nice with arrays (there&#39;s a <a href="http://www.angelikalanger.com/GenericsFAQ/FAQSections/ParameterizedTypes.html#FAQ104">ginormous FAQ</a> dedicated to that particular pita specifically which I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re not too eager to suffer through right now). If you need to limit the max size of each cage, simply use ArrayList&lt;T&gt; and pass the max size as a constructor parameter (<code>animals = new ArrayList&lt;T&gt;(size)</code>) (and then in your Cage class implementation, add a size check which will print an error or throw an  exception if you&#39;re trying to add another animal to a Cage that&#39;s at full capacity).    </p>

<p><strong>tl:dr</strong> - 1) MyClass&lt;T&gt; is called a parametrized (generic) class, and T is called a <em>type parameter</em>. Think of it as a placeholder like a variable is a placeholder for value, only T is a placeholder for the variable type. <code>T</code> doesn&#39;t mean &quot;throw at me whatever&quot;, it means &quot;choose any type you want and then throw at me objects of that type&quot;.    </p>

<p>2) You can declare T[] but you cannot instantiate it with <code>new T[]</code> because complicated type safety reasons. So for now if you can find any way around it, like using List or Set or whatever that is not an array, do it instead. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The reason is simply because there is no year 0 (in most [all?] calendars, in particular the Gregorian which he is referring to in the question). In <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex34.html">Shaw&#39;s terms</a> (which I just read over) apparently &quot;ordinal&quot; means count starting from 1, and &quot;cardinal&quot; means count starting from 0, so I suppose the answer he is looking for is that since the calendar year is <em>meant</em> to be &quot;ordinal&quot; no conversion to &quot;cardinal&quot; is necessary. However you should know I&#39;ve never seen anybody else define <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinal_number">ordinal</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_number">cardinal</a> numbers this way and I&#39;m leaning towards calling it completely incorrect, or at least that it totally ignores the more important aspects of their usual meanings. Normally you&#39;ll see this issue referred to as &quot;0 or 1 based indexing&quot;, not ordinal vs cardinal.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t worry about this question.  It appears to be of questionable value.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I was thinking of trying LPTHW out... Not anymore if those are the stupid questions it asks. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Awesome, thanks guys. I can now sleep easy knowing this question is just wonky. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t meaningfully do this with client-side code (such as the javascript running on the browser).  Security best practices dictate that you should assume the entire client is compromised/malicious, so you need to do this on the server side.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d advise you to generate the captcha server-side or use something ready made like recaptcha, as a captcha implemented completely in the browser would be trivial to bypass.  However, to answer the question:</p>

<p>First you&#39;ll need to store which text maps to which image somewhere, something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var capchas = [
    { text: &quot;q24gs&quot;, image: &quot;1.png&quot; },
    { text: &quot;86fs3&quot;, image: &quot;2.png&quot; },
    { text: &quot;xp936&quot;, image: &quot;3.png&quot; },
    ...
];
</code></pre>

<p>Then you&#39;ll need to select one using the Math.random() function.  It returns a random floating point number between 0 and 1, so you need to multiply up to the number of images and round it with Math.floor():</p>

<pre><code>var selectedCaptcha = captchas[Math.floor((Math.random() * captchas.length) + 1)];
document.getElementById(&quot;yourImageElement&quot;).src = &quot;yourImageFolder/&quot; + selectedCaptcha.image;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, although not specified in your question, you&#39;ll need to compare the user&#39;s input to the text stored against your captcha image:</p>

<pre><code>document.getElementById(&quot;yourButton&quot;).addEventListener(
    &quot;click&quot;, 
    function() {
        var attempt = document.getElementById(&quot;YourUserInputField&quot;).value;
        if(attempt === selectedCaptcha.text) {
            // Success, handle correct captcha match here.
        } else {
            // Failure, handle incorrect captcha match here.
        }
    },
    false
);
</code></pre>

<p>Again, I&#39;d strongly advise you DON&#39;T do this in anything but a learning exercise.</p>

<p>This would be a mess! So instead of rewriting the same code over and over, you make a function containing those 4 lines of code, and whenever you want to do that thing, you simply call the function. There&#39;s a little more to it, but that&#39;s the general idea. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For me, the use for functions in mainly to reuse code. I can for example create a function that reads a file and return the contents. It would consist of a couple of lines of code. Now everytime i need to read a file, i just call that function! It&#39;s particularely usefull in object oriented language where you can pack those functions in an object to use in other classes.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For the first one: <a href="http://pastebin.com/W3W8D2fq">http://pastebin.com/W3W8D2fq</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Probably, but this is because you have prior programming experience.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You said you&#39;ve already used Django, so why don&#39;t you think you&#39;re already competent?  Can&#39;t you just look up things you need in their docs and make your own projects with it now?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Maybe the class has too much responsibility? Maybe you can pass some of these parameters in while you&#39;re calling methods instead? But sometimes you just need a lot of parameters. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s far too many. Like any other function, a constructor should generally take no more than three or four parameters, ideally fewer.</p>

<p>Also, if you want to get any help here in the future, please do <em>not</em> delete your questions.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As many as it needs. So the question isn&#39;t &quot;is 12 too many&quot;, it&#39;s &quot;does it <em>need</em> 12&quot;. The answer is likely that it doesn&#39;t. Without seeing the code I can&#39;t give you much direct advice, but I would recommend having a good long look at it and determining just what <em>needs</em> to be passed to the constructor and why.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Go through your <code>appendNode</code> function very carefully by hand, on paper, assuming that you are appending the value&nbsp;5 to an empty list. Describe very carefully and precisely exactly what every line of code is doing.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>See <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_certifications">http://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/wiki/faq_certifications</a></p>

<p>The general consensus is that certifications for software development are more or less useless, and can actually detract from your resume in some cases (the logic is that anybody who can program wouldn&#39;t waste time on earning some certification).</p>

<p>There are a few exceptions/a few certificates which might perhaps be useful to acquire, depending on what you plan to do with your career, and people&#39;s attitudes regarding IT certificates are completely different, but the above link should cover all the nuances.</p>

<p>The best way to demonstrate skill is to prepare a portfolio/have multiple non-trivial projects to show and talk about. You&#39;ll find that most developers tend to host their portfolio on Github, so you should definitely think about making an account there/using Github for version control, if you haven&#39;t already.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Portfolio i.e. github. Write things.</p>

<p>Certs are worthless.</p>

<p>Source: software engineer, have no certs. No one even asks about my degree either tbh, just care about experience.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>My question is what&#39;s the best way to show employers I&#39;m competent at coding and have more experience in coding than other Mechanical Engineers? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Write something. Publish it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Should I take some programming certification exams?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. They are essentially worthless.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think your best bet is to build a portfolio showcasing your coding, a few good quality projects on Github will be cheaper and just as good if not better than one of those certifications. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>They can help you get your foot in the door. HR and non-technical managers aren&#39;t going to look at a portfolio. But another programmer is going to want to see some code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Certs are a red flag for our screening process. Especially shady or ridiculous ones. If coupled with lack of work experience, it means at best, bottom of pile, at worst, we toss the resume out. I wouldn&#39;t recommend navigating that minefield.</p>

<p>Not saying all certifications are bad. There are some worthwhile certification programs out there. But they are few and far between in an ocean of snake-oil. Also, the appropriate certifications are highly dependent on the position and company you&#39;re applying for. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Having motivation is the only way to go, so yes. Do everything in your power to keep the motivation up. Don&#39;t get stuck with minor things like &quot;is this the best solution,&quot; because no, it&#39;s really not. :)</p>

<p>Maybe a few years from now you could be an authority on distributed accounting systems. Anyways, just focus on what you think is the smallest accounting program possible - and work towards that. Before hitting the books (or courses) I recommend watching videos that show an introduction to a topic, such as classes or functions. That way, you&#39;ll have some inkling of what it&#39;s all about.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I see that it might be hard for beginners to estimate the effort needed to develop software, but doing a real-world end-user application is quite much.</p>

<p>Complexity-wise, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too hard to implement mathematical formulas. So I&#39;d start with them and test them (google for &quot;test-driven development python&quot; or something like that). You don&#39;t have to necessarily implement reading or inputting data or any user interface to be able to test your formulas (or any function you&#39;ll ever write). However you&#39;d have to write testing functions in this case.</p>

<p>This by itself should make a library/module you are importing in your actual application.</p>

<p>Then you&#39;ll have to consider how you are going to store persistent data. You aren&#39;t limited to files. You also have the possibility for databases, and actually for your specific project, and since you are just starting as a programmer, I&#39;d recommend using SQLite. The Python standard library module to interact with SQLite is very good. An SQLite database does not require any additional software installed, since it&#39;s either included in your Python runtime. And it&#39;s quite error-tolerant and simple (there are only 5 different data types for example). The advantage over raw text files would probably be that you wouldn&#39;t have to care about a data format, parsing it, fear manipulation etc. - and your datasets will probably have only a few, repeated different structures anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also recommend to wrap that up as a <em>data abstraction layer</em> in a library you import.</p>

<p>Then, independently of all this, you can think about user input/and output, about a GUI and so on. Here you&#39;ll also have multiple options. The standard library only offers Tcl/Tkint as a way do make GUIs, but you could also use the (external) libraries GTK or Qt. In anyway, don&#39;t underestimate the sheer amount of code need to implement a seemingly simple UI. As an example just look at <a href="https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop/tree/master/Telegram/SourceFiles/gui">all those files</a> that are needed to implement the GUI for the <a href="http://stadt-bremerhaven.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Telegram-Windows.jpg">Telegram client for Windows</a>. (It&#39;s based on Qt iirc)</p>

<p>You could also implement a website (not on the internet though) as a GUI. That might be simpler. (And would have the benefit that you could acess it from any device in your home network or in a business network) And if you are going to seperate your concerns into different modules, it should be possible to switch between UI implementations.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are lots of points you could start.</p>

<p>There are libraries like SFML, frameworks like <a href="http://qt-project.org/">Qt</a>, engines like <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal</a>, and going from the ground up like in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/handmadeheroarchive">Handmade Hero</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;d guess SFML or Qt is the way for your level of experience.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Check out <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">http://www.sfml-dev.org/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/">http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d REALLY recommend sfml.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yikes! Neither version of the code in that article should ever be used.  It does no kind of escaping, leaving the door wide open for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection attack</a>.  The name of the parameter collides with the global <code>$_POST</code> variable in PHP, which is bad form at best and broken at worst (depending on how PHP handles the situation).  There are several other issues, but those are the two that stood out to me immediately.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Of course HTML is not obsolete. All Web pages are written in HTML.</p>

<p>Note, however, that HTML is not a programming language. It is a markup language, used to describe the content and structure of Web pages. You cannot write <em>programs</em> in HTML.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No, as the others have pointed out HTML is the language of the web. It&#39;s not a programming language, but literally any website you use today is built with HTML and CSS</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>if you learn both a programming language (python/C etc) and html you can use the code to generate html for you... I&#39;ve done this quite a few times, and it&#39;s beneficial when you have many similar html elements with slightly different properties. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>HTML and css aren&#39;t going anywhere but to do any real development you will need to add other languages (c#, javascript, sql, etc) to go with them.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This sort of thing usually happens when you try to use a <code>Scanner</code> after it&#39;s been closed. You&#39;ll need to post at least the code around this <code>Scanner</code> use for someone to help you more specifically. Better if you can trim your problem down to an SSCCE (see sidebar guideline 5) and post that.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason you could not catch <code>IllegalStateException</code> and have the program continue. You&#39;d need to post the code you tried to use that didn&#39;t work to get advice on that.</p>

<p>Better, I think, to make sure that exception never happens in the first place.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In general, you could just make a new <code>Scanner</code> every time you need to read in a file.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Since you&#39;ve given us zero information about what it is you&#39;re actually trying to accomplish, I recommend learning the kazoo. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s worth learning if you want to work with it, or if you <em>have</em> to work with it.  It does&#39;t have any unique features that would make it interesting academically.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are loads of jobs near where I live that ask for some experience with servlets, and I was taught how to use JSP in uni, so on a generic level, it&#39;s probably worth learning.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>.NET is a platform used for everything from desktop applications to web apps and games. You can do pretty much anything short of writing drivers in it (actually, you may be able to do that with .NET Native it will just be really awkward compared to writing it in C++). It&#39;s kind of a big platform. Microsoft has a bunch of tutorials on their developer site to help you get started in any of the main languages built on .NET (I recommend using either C# or F#- C# is going to be more familiar coming from Java, but F# is a lot of fun). </p>

<p>If you&#39;re talking about HTML and CSS with .NET, you&#39;re probably referring to ASP.NET, Microsoft&#39;s web framework. That can be used to write any dynamic website you want. Make a simple Reddit clone, or social network, or inventory system. If you want to get more complex, write a networked game or chat system using SignalR. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The best resource I found when learning .Net was easily learnvisualstudio.net</p>

<p>It&#39;s Bob Tabor&#39;s site and he now does a lot of the developer tutorials on MSDN.</p>

<p>It&#39;s slightly expensive, but I&#39;ve never second guessed my decision of buying the lifetime membership.  Being able to quickly go right to the topic you&#39;re working on was a real help.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>My first big C# application when I was learning it was actually a reddit statistics bot. It would scrape subreddits for data (subscriber count) and log it to a database, and it would always be running. That was a lot of fun and I learned a ton. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Is there a particular part of those instructions that your are having an issue with?</p>

<p>1) Create a Payroll class<br/>
2) Create an driver class to demonstrate the Payroll class.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This assignment is worded as straight as it gets.</p>

<p>Most of the assignment text can directly be converted to Java code.</p>

<ul>
<li>You need 2 classes, <code>Payroll</code> and a class to test the implementation of Payroll.</li>
<li>Currently, you only need 2 fields in the Payroll class, <code>hoursWorked</code> and <code>payRate</code> (which is obviously an hourly rate).</li>
<li>You need to find a suitable data type for the fields. </li>
<li>You need a default constructor.</li>
<li>You need setters and getters (mutators and accessors) for the two fields.</li>
<li>Last, you need a method (your prof calls it getter) that returns the gross pay which is hoursWorked * payRate.</li>
<li>If hoursWorked &gt; 40, you need to multiply all the hours over that limit by 1.5 (that&#39;s an overtime regulation).</li>
</ul>

<hr/>

<p>Your second file should test the implementation of the Payroll class.</p>

<ul>
<li>You need to create a new object of type Payroll</li>
<li>You need to ask the user to enter the hours worked</li>
<li>You need to ask the user to enter the pay rate</li>
<li>Store that information in the payroll instance (using the setters)</li>
<li>Calculate and print out the gross pay, formatted as $00.00</li>
</ul>

<p>Really, that assignment is perfectly clearly worded without leaving any, even the smallest, room for doubt.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, a pixel is just a tuple <code>&lt;R, G, B&gt;</code>, where <code>R</code>, <code>G</code>, <code>B</code> are all integers within [0, 255].  You can just randomly assign values to each pixel.  The resulting image would look like garbage, of course.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll probably get more assistance debugging the behavior if you put it into JSFiddle so others could quickly try to help. </p>

<p>Anyhow, any reason you&#39;re not trying responsive design/media queries? Seems like that&#39; be the best way of handling desktop/mobile versions. I could be misunderstanding you though. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Possible, sure.  You&#39;ll get pretty good at &quot;printf&quot; debugging ;P.  But seriously, a debugger is a very powerful tool if you know how to use it - learn.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If so, how can I fix the bugs in my large codebase quickly?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>&quot;I shall learn how to unit test.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall learn how to unit test.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall learn how to unit test.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I shall learn how to unit test.&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible.  More than likely slower.     </p>

<p>Using a debugger with MPI systems or distributed systems can be troublesome depending on the types of bugs. Problems usually end up being timing related so a good logging mechanism often is best for tracking down errors.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s certainly possible. What works best is highly variable and depends on many factors. Ultimately, you are trying to be as productive as possible. Note that debugging distributed applications such as MPI is trickier with a debugger, but can still work.</p>

<p>What kind of a bug was it?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Gdb has a steep learning curve. I&#39;m afraid (but not certain, of course) they may be unwilling to admit their inexperience with it to you. I most definitely <em>would</em> master gdb as quickly as possible if I were you. You&#39;d be at a huge advantage to other programmers. I still know little about gdb, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you could try strace:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace</a></p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to use -ff -o &lt;filename&gt; for a per-fork trace. How feasible this is for your aims, I don&#39;t know.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not clear what you&#39;re trying to do. Are you attempting to make a class that you can modify on the fly, after the program is compiled, or are you just trying to make a... Class?</p>

<p>If all you want is to make a class to hold a bunch of stuff you thought up while writing the program, you just write it:</p>

<pre><code>public class Thing
{
    string Name { get; set; }
    string Place { get; set; }
    double Height { get; set; }
    double Weight { get; set; }
    decimal Price { get; set; }
    bool ForSale { get; set; }

    // to store multiple items of a given type
    ICollection&lt;Weapon&gt; Weapons { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is generally preferable because it gives you compile time checking of the work you do with the class. You can make one and add arbitrary properties at runtime, but that is actually a lot harder to do and you only rarely need to do it.</p>

<p>Does this help?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C# doesn&#39;t have dictionary literals, and C# objects are not just dictionaries anyway. You can deserialize JSON into C# objects if that&#39;s what you&#39;re looking for- there&#39;s a couple different deserializers built-in but the general consensus is to use the 3rd party <a href="http://www.newtonsoft.com/json">JSON.NET</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could do this part in F# which does have object literals. See <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233184.aspx">here</a>. You&#39;d have to define this in a separate DLL because I don&#39;t think .NET supports compiling multiple languages into a single file yet, but it will show up in C# as a normal class.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Can you explain what your algorithm is trying to do?</p>

<p>Let&#39;s begin with an assessment of at least the minimum amount of work that any correct algorithm would have to do.  In this case, the contents of the two arrays are unknown and arbitrary (e.g. the array is not sorted, and there are no constraints on what strings may appear in the array).  Therefore, at minimum, the algorithm needs to examine every element in both arrays in order to determine common strings.</p>

<p>Since your code only has one for loop that iterates over the <code>b</code> array, it cannot be correct, since it has not examined every element in <code>a</code>.</p>

<p>As some thought, the most efficient data structure for this problem would be a <code>HashSet&lt;String&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Edit: Your post doesn&#39;t actually mention the constraint that both arrays are actually sorted, which makes a merge operation the most optimal solution.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Hey, I&#39;m working on making your buttons now using JavaScript. I&#39;ll let you know when it&#39;s done. I&#39;m creating an array with the texts inside of it, and a function to sort through the array and pick out a text at random. Each heading will be a button that will activate the function. Can you send me the lists of texts? That would make it easier than using placeholders. I can also teach you, if you&#39;d like. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use a double dimension array.</p>

<p><code>char*[]</code> or <code>char**</code> or <code>char[][]</code></p>

<p>If you know the number of sentences you&#39;re receiving, then you can use the first option, which assumes a number of variable length sentences held in a fixed array (known <em>number</em> of sentences).</p>

<p>something like this:</p>

<pre><code>[&quot;Hello world!&quot;]

[&quot;This is r/learnprogramming!&quot;]

[&quot;This is another message of variable length&quot;]

[&quot;This array contains 4 sentences, each of variable length!&quot;]
</code></pre>

<p>You can use a double pointer when you have a variable number of sentences and a variable sentence length. </p>

<p>Use the last option if you know the exact length of each sentence and how many sentences you&#39;re going to have.</p>

<p>Hope this helped! good luck</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It seems like you&#39;re using the pre-built binaries, and opencv got rid of support for MinGW pre-built binaries.  Currently, only Visual Studio is supported with pre-built libraries.</p>

<p>Visual Studio will be easier to set up than MinGW/Code Blocks.  I would personally go that route since it&#39;s the path of least resistance.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Code Blocks</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;re deadset on MinGW and Code::Blocks, then you&#39;ll need to build opencv from source.  Follow the steps listed in <a href="http://kevinhughes.ca/tutorials/opencv-install-on-windows-with-codeblocks-and-mingw/">the tutorial you&#39;ve been using</a>.  </p>

<p>CMake will generate the MinGW libraries for you to use.</p>

<p>In Code Blocks, you&#39;ll need to add the opencv include files to your build path.  Additionally, you&#39;ll have to add the static binaries you just generated in the linker.  The tutorial describes how to do this.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Visual Studio</strong></p>

<p>If you end up using Visual Studio, you can make a new project right away.</p>

<p>Right-click on the project&#39;s name in the Solution Explorer and go to Configuration Properties -&gt; C/C++ -&gt; General.  In &quot;Additional Include Directories&quot;, click the dropdown arrow, and click Edit.  Add the directory where opencv/include is located.  For me, it is C:\opencv\build\include.  Press OK</p>

<p>While you&#39;re still in Project Properties, go to Configuration Properties -&gt; Linker -&gt; General.  In &quot;Additional Library directories&quot;, you should add the directory where the Visual Studio libraries are installed.  For me, this is C:\opencv\build\x86\vc12\lib.  Keep in mind that a 64-bit build of your project requires x64 instead of x86.  Also, your version of Visual Studio matters.  I&#39;m using Visual Studio Community (highly recommend this free version), so I selected vc12.</p>

<p>At this point, you should be able to use opencv&#39;s features in your project.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> VS linker path should be \vc12\lib according to <a href="http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/windows_visual_studio_Opencv/windows_visual_studio_Opencv.html">this link</a>.</p>

<p>To address your question, think about how many times the following loops will iterate:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 2; ++i) {
    printf(&quot;Loop one: %d\n&quot;, i);

</div><div class="md"><p>I recommend you stick with what you&#39;re doing and to write some programs. Programming is best learned by doing.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry too much about whether some resources are destructive to beginners. Many people will have reasons why one thing or the other is bad but your measure, as a beginner, should be whether you can write programs of increasing scope and complexity.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Best way to learn, in my experience, is to just think of a program you want to make, and work on it. Google when you get stuck.

</blockquote>

<p>This is not a problem unique to programming. The problem is most people are not good teachers; they often don&#39;t know how learning works in general, they just know how learning worked for <em>them</em>, and are eager to give advice along that direction. The state of online education is like a quilt of many thousands of people trying to teach something which will often be effective to only some percentage of its consumers. This is not in any way a bad thing. It means there are lots of sources which can appeal to different people&#39;s style of learning and different people&#39;s objectives. But it does make the world of independent learning rather daunting. </p>

<p>My advice is pick some good universities (especially large public universities that appeal to a large diversity of students), go to their website, and see how they shaped their curriculum. There is a lot of thought on curriculum design going on in these schools, and you can benefit from what they think is a general way to shape an education in this field. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think that a good way - use a variable called &quot;delay&quot;

</div><div class="md"><p>+1 for CS50. This will teach you basic foundations in C, move to PHP and a bit of JavaScript for the web. This will be a solid start for being a full stack developer.</p>

<p>You&#39;re going to need to be proficient in order to manipulate the browser as in the samples. I would recommend eloquent javascript to get up to speed:<br/>
<a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">http://eloquentjavascript.net</a><br/>

<p>Once you have the fundamentals I would recommend learning a framework to help you build web apps for clients quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>For Ruby (and Rails) I would recommend Michael Hartl&#39;s Rails Tutorial book that teaches you how to build and <em>test</em> a Twitter clone. <a href="https://www.railstutorial.org">https://www.railstutorial.org</a></p>

<p>For JavaScript, Meteor is becoming really popular and makes web apps that are <em>really</em> fast and snappy on the client end. DiscoverMeteor shows you how to build a mini Reddit clone. I&#39;ve built 3 production Meteor apps and they are now secure, fast, and performant (even with thousands of concurrent users). <a href="https://www.discovermeteor.com">https://www.discovermeteor.com</a>  A further step would be to use better architecture which is a bit out of scope for the book (you could even start this book now and revisit after CS50), but I use this setup for prod. apps: <a href="https://github.com/AdamBrodzinski/meteor-generate">https://github.com/AdamBrodzinski/meteor-generate</a></p>

<p>I&#39;m sure there are other good frameworks and languages but i&#39;ve had great luck with these. Currently I use Meteor for almost all projects due to the customer demands of needing fast web apps.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you have no programming experience at all, I&#39;d start with something like <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> or MIT&#39;s <a href="http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/">Introduction To Computer Science and Programming</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;d honestly recommend <a href="http://cs50.tv/2014/fall/#about,lectures">CS50</a>(C) or <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/see/courseinfo.aspx?coll=824a47e1-135f-4508-a5aa-866adcae1111">Stanford&#39;s 106A introduction course</a>(Java) instead, if you&#39;re absolutely new to programming because the MIT course is freakin&#39; hard.  You learn a lot, but it pushes you and if you haven&#39;t had math in a while like me, it&#39;s even rougher.</p>

<p><a href="http://cs75.tv/2012/summer/">
CS75</a> is Harvard&#39;s course on web development.  All the lectures and materials are available online for free.  It teaches a LAMP stack which is Linux, Apache, MySql and PHP. The class assumes you have a decent understanding of HTML/CSS and programming.  I think it&#39;s a decent primer on full stack web programming.</p>

<p>The appliance CS75 uses is a little bit of a pain to set up so if you do decide to take that route, PM me and I&#39;ll walk you through the setup so you&#39;re not pounding the keyboard in frustration trying to get it to work.</p>

<p>For C# <a href="http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/">The Yellow Book</a> is a pretty good starting point. </p>

<p>That&#39;s all I got. Hopefully it&#39;s somewhat helpful.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>As people have said already I think Python is a great place to start as an introduction to programming in general and the logic behind it which is very transferable skills wise.</p>

<p>If you&#39;d like to get on a similar level talking to your dev teams I&#39;d recommend speaking to them, ask what tools &amp; technologies they use. From my experience every organisation will use their own combination of these tools &amp; technologies so you could learn a different set that people on here suggest but if the organisation you work for uses something radically different the concepts might transfer but its not going to be as easy as if you get to grips with the same stuff they use on a daily basis. Plus if the place you work for is pushing out some good work then you will get a feel for what clients expect too.</p>

<p>Also it seems like you want to build websites in general but as I&#39;m sure you&#39;re aware at your current job people usually work in front-end (actual web page content, appearance etc) or back-end (API development, databases etc) development with some cross over usually. In your case I think you can learn concepts for both in a 6 month period but I would definitely drift towards front-end development if you are interested in user interfaces and experiences.</p>

<p>If you do want to go the front-end route I&#39;d probably look at stuff like jQuery, AngularJS, Node.js, modernizr and generally learn about JavaScript (not to be confused with Java) first as many of these frameworks use JavaScript in some capacity and of those three websites you sent a link for they use frameworks from the above.</p>

<p>I think finally I&#39;d say do what you are interested in, people may tell you this framework is awesome or you should only ever build stuff the way they say, while there will be good design guides and popular technologies at the end of the day people are interested in what gets the job done best and meets their needs, so play about and good luck! </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Android development is at a weird point in its life cycle. Most resources are geared towards the old style of using Eclipse with the Android add-on, where that is slowly being replaced as people make their way over to Android Studio, Google&#39;s proprietary development environment.</p>

<p>Resources are relatively scarce for the new environment, but most of the old practices still apply. Might be in your best interest to read up on the Android SDK. You&#39;ll need to familiarize yourself with the new event handlers, since the input method is different than in normal Java (you have to account for touch, obviously.)</p>

<p>Most books are not free, but you can easily find PDFs online if you do a little bit of digging. I would suggest Head First Android Development, only for its &quot;less-technical&quot; approach to introducing concepts. Once you understand them, then perhaps move on to something a little more professional, like Learn Java for Android Development. Otherwise, there are plenty of free &quot;Hello World&quot; and other basic tutorials online through several &quot;code schools&quot; if you&#39;d rather be walked through some of the development, rather than reading about it.</p>

It is the defacto standard for functional testing in a browser. Even better there are a couple wrappers built around it that reduce the boilerplate required.  If you prefer to stick with .NET, take a look at canopy. It is built on f# and provides a very terse syntax.  If you don&#39;t mind using ruby you might be interested in watir webdriver.</p>

<p>Hats off to you for being professional about this.  It&#39;s a bad idea and I&#39;d like to help you expand on the reasons why that is so.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Technical debt.  One person, with very limited experience can&#39;t pull off a job like this.</p></li>
<li><p>Unrealistic expectations.  Where did this 2 month deadline come from?  Has the project been properly spec&#39;ed, planned and estimated.  I doubt it.</p></li>
<li><p>Migration.  All the existing information from the previous system needs to be merged into the new one.  That in itself is a massive and risky task.</p></li>
<li><p>Training.  Everyone in the company knows how to use the existing system. They will all need to be trained on the new system.</p></li>
<li><p>Transition.  How/when does the transition from the old to the new take place? What are the fallbacks and recovery plans?</p></li>
<li><p>Fixes/Workarounds.  Something is wrong with the existing system.  The decision to re-write a system is a massive one.  Fixing something is always easier than re-building it from scratch.  Your search problems might be as simple as a few tweaks. They might not be but it&#39;s worth exploring first.</p></li>
<li><p>People.  I find that a lot of problems with a large system stem from the way they are used.  Is the root cause the way the system is used (ie. incorrect file names, tags, etc)?  If so replacing the system isn&#39;t the right path.</p></li>
<li><p>Of the shelf solutions.  Basic document management has been solved before, by bigger dogs than you.  Personally, I&#39;d be spending that two months researching and trialling other products.</p></li>

</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know how difficult this is using a laptop keyboard, but AFAIK, it&#39;s possible.</p>

<p>Press and hold the ALT key, press 0165 (that&#39;s 0, 1, 6, 5) from the numeric keypad keys using the Fn key, then release the ALT key. On laptop, the numeric keypad keys are combined onto the 7, 8, 9; U, I, O; J, K, L; and M keys.</p>
</div> as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Big companies are doing this for weeks/months before they even write a line of code. Especially when they have multiple teams working on the same project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outline what you want to do and make a rough design on how the different components work together and you will never have this problem again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unit tests will help make sure your code is behaving as you expect. This helps reduce stress by alerting you if you break something and helps you totally understand the logic of whatever you are working on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be afraid to refactor your code as well. Too large of a code base can be a hard thing to deal with if left unmanaged. Be sure to remove redundancies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having self-documenting code has been amazingly helpful to me. It lets your program describe &amp;quot;what&amp;quot; it is doing and leaves you the ability to use comments to describe &amp;quot;why&amp;quot; something is happening. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the response of this SO article help explain it: &lt;a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209015/what-is-self-documenting-code-and-can-it-replace-well-documented-code"&gt;http://stackoverflow.com/questions/209015/what-is-self-documenting-code-and-can-it-replace-well-documented-code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope this helps&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You shouldn&amp;#39;t be stressed about it if you are making it modular and properly documenting it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;0) Make clear administratively that you need time to get used to the code base. Try to find a &amp;quot;mentor&amp;quot;, who can help you with questions about the product and just someone to discuss your issues with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) get the tool chain in gear - you must be able to build the current sources, get them on the device, and run them. Plus, source control (You &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; have source control, don&amp;#39;t you?). Make yourself familiar with the debugging and diagnostic tools available. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your embedded environment, this might be particulary nasty (compared to not working cross-platform). Debugging tools are somewhere between primadonna and nonexistent, compile-flash-and-run might be non-automatable and have 5 minutes turnaround for even the slightest change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milestone:&lt;/strong&gt; At this point, you should be able to make a change to the source code, observe its effect, and undo the change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next days, get used to the tool chain. That&amp;#39;s your boot camp. I should be able to keep you awake for two nights, then fill you up with a bottle of gin, send you to bed, pull you out of your sleep after four hours and you must be able to build and run your code without a single mistake. Especially important for embedded, where the sources for errors are many. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) Start reading the code. 
Try to correlate it to observable (or - if available - specified) behavior. Small reversible changes can test your ideas which piece of code is responsible for what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start documenting the code, as far as you understand it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For variables and functions, a one-liner with their purpose (&amp;quot;Reason for existence&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For functions, start with documenting their inside what the next chunk of code does. From that build a documentation of the function itself: pre-/ post-conditions, side effects etc. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There will be large segments of code as well as repeated patterns that don&amp;#39;t make sense. Don&amp;#39;t dwell on them, just take notes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milestone:&lt;/strong&gt; You should start making sense of the code, you will lern some &amp;quot;habits&amp;quot; of the original author(s), function names like &lt;code&gt;pf2mk_Up()&lt;/code&gt; should start to make sense.&lt;br/&gt;
Note that at this point you haven&amp;#39;t made any &amp;quot;productive&amp;quot; changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3)  Step through with the debugger, to learn more about the code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For embedded, that can be a bit tricky - to put it mildly. Maybe you just don&amp;#39;t have this option - that&amp;#39;s why get used to all the other diagnostics (corner pixel on the display, or oscilloscope on a certain pin... the options many!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4) Tests&lt;br/&gt;
At this point - or rather, overlapping wiht Step 2 - the common recommendation would be writing unit tests. They should &amp;quot;document&amp;quot; the expected behavior, and they would help you establish that you haven&amp;#39;t broken anything obvious at least. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For embedded, same as 3) But that&amp;#39;s not the end of the world, they are - like everything else - a means to an end. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5) Plan your first productive change. 
&lt;strong&gt;Before&lt;/strong&gt; your write the code: Write down what you want to achieve, how you verify you have achieved exactly that, and how you verify you haven&amp;#39;t broken anything. 
(The trendy answer would be unit tests. tough luck for embedded.)&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Before&lt;/strong&gt; you write the code, verify that the device behaves as expected without the change. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you made the change, go down your checklist of verifications. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t need to go through these steps formally for every change - it is good to build confidence, but always verify yourself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milestone:&lt;/strong&gt; You can accept, estimate, implement and release a change request. You aren&amp;#39;t yet &amp;quot;up to speed&amp;quot;, but you are getting there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6) Refactor bad code  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it is likely that the code base has problems, needs to be cleaned up, etc. I urge you to wait with that, and to refactor what that you completely understand. The temptation to get rid of a piece of code that gives you headache by rewriting it is strong, but the chance to miss an important detail is still big in this phase. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rinse. Repeat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;other tools: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A tool like doxygen can extract declarations and specifically formatted comments to create a formal, searchable browsable documentation. It can also generate call and dependency graphs which, while often overwhelming on their own, can help you make sense of the code. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is source control (my money is on &amp;quot;no&amp;quot;): studying the commits is another way to get familiar with the code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a strange question, at least.  Umm ... I don&amp;#39;t think there is any color convention to this.  But, if you were concerned, just find a few existing diagrams from respected sources and see what they do.  If all of their colors seem to match then go with that convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is awesome. Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tech &amp;gt; phones &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think about os &amp;gt; manufacture &amp;gt; os version &amp;gt; phone model &amp;gt; capacity &amp;gt; type Internet connection (3g, 4G etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;all of these things are related to &amp;#39;phone&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As primary key you can choose ID (not name) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something in film?  Why not think about how imdb stores it&amp;#39;s data: people, films, actors, crew, directors, users, ratings, trivia, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be sure you&amp;#39;re using as few SpriteBatch instances as possible, and calling &lt;code&gt;draw()&lt;/code&gt; on them within the same &lt;code&gt;begin()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end()&lt;/code&gt; calls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bad&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SpriteBatch batch1 = new SpriteBatch();
batch.begin();
batch.draw( ... );
batch.end();

SpriteBatch batch2 = new SpriteBatch();
batch2.begin();
batch2.draw( ... );
batch2.end();

SpriteBatch batch3 = new SpriteBatch();
batch3.begin();
batch3.draw( ... );
batch3.end();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SpriteBatch batch = new SpriteBatch();
batch.begin();
batch.draw( ... );
batch.end();

/* logic here */

batch.begin();
batch.draw( ... );
batch.end();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;SpriteBatch batch = new SpriteBatch();

/* logic here */

batch.begin();
batch.draw( ... );
batch.draw( ... );
batch.end();
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I normally keep one master SpriteBatch instance in my main Game class and pass it to each entity&amp;#39;s &lt;code&gt;render()&lt;/code&gt; method within the main render loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though it&amp;#39;s shitty to lose a project, let it go and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tossing code or entire applications is perfectly common in the programming business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I work in a field where lots of what I do is either never used or scrapped.  This happens a lot in research fields.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The important thing is you learned from what you did and can maybe use the work (either directly or indirectly) in a future project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have to learn to let go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In your situation it&amp;#39;s pretty easy and benign, but in other situations, it can be very armful to not being able to scrap some code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometime the best thing to do for the project is to send a big chunk of code to the trash bin, and some coders are too proud, or stubborn to realize it. Code in itself is worthless. Code can slow the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let it go...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, first and foremost, you shouldn&amp;#39;t be coding for WPF like you do for winforms.  Aside from the constructor, your code-behind should be empty.  You should implement that button click handler as an ICommand - just google  &amp;quot;RoutedEvent ICommand&amp;quot; for a decent implementation - and then bind it to your button using the Command dependency property.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, without seeing the code for the CreateAccount window, there&amp;#39;s no way that I, personally, can help you other than to say it may be a DataContext issue.  The other thing you can do is in the Debug menu in visual studio, click Exceptions and ensure the CLR category has both User Unhandled and Thrown checked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It sounds like you already have a very well rounded toolkit for web development.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would switch it up and do Swift. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re already full stack why not learn ruby and RoR to make yourself even more well-rounded?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;C++&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy Cake day bruhh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A framework is a conglomeration of tools that work together to solve a problem. For instance ASP.NET is a framework for building websites. It uses C# for its backend, SQL for its data storage ect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank your for asking this, I keep wondering this in my Ruby on Rails class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decent overview is given here: &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework"&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can understand the concept by looking at examples of frameworks. For example, Django is a web application framework. This means that it takes care of a lot of low-level details and functionality common to most web applications, and provides a supporting structure that you can base your specific application on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve seriously been so afraid to ask this and I haven&amp;#39;t found a good explanation on the wide web so thank you for asking this!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can anyone enlighten us on which is a solid framework to learn for, say, job opportunities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you used the javax swing library?  You could use that to make simple games pretty easily with Java.   Assign yourself a project and lookup what you need as you go.   You could make a tic-tac-toe game pretty easily. Then try pong, snake etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;how much do you know?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to be able to program a game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know only a bit of Java that I&amp;#39;ve learned from some classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can try some &lt;a href="http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_list/games"&gt;exercises vaguely related to games&lt;/a&gt;, which may improve your skills in both language and logic...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m unsure about the differences between other languages and but understand that others do better at certain things than other languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s true but unless you have some specific goal, usually almost every contemporary language will do well. Java is bit more verbose and bit more complicated to start - but on the other hand it may lead you to position with fatter salary, he-he :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d love to be able to program a game or do some part in a game with programming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s an interesting problem: write a program to solve the 8-puzzle (&lt;a href="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos226/assignments/8puzzle.html"&gt;http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr10/cos226/assignments/8puzzle.html&lt;/a&gt;). You&amp;#39;ll have to read up on the A* algorithm, which is used as a basis for many game AI-s (e.g., see &lt;a href="http://theory.stanford.edu/%7Eamitp/GameProgramming/"&gt;http://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/&lt;/a&gt;). It&amp;#39;ll be a small challenging project that will expose you to new areas you might not be familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do you think it would take so long? Computers are really fast! A thousand pieces of data is nothing, this crappy Mac book I&amp;#39;m typing from does 2.4 BILLION calculations a second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Look at question 1 under &amp;quot;Frequently Asked Questions&amp;quot; in the right hand column of this subreddit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s how I&amp;#39;d approach this problem if I were you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I&amp;#39;ll get a handle on the problem. I&amp;#39;ll run through a sequence of ships arriving, waiting, docking, and leaving. You have  3 types of docking space and 1 waiting list. In your simulations on paper, represent these elements diagrammatically. I&amp;#39;d imagine that 4 rows of rectangles would suffice. For example, how will this sequence play out: S1 arrives, S2 arrives, M1 arrives, L1 arrives, L2 arrives, L3 arrives, M2 arrives, M1 leaves, L1 leaves, L4 arrives, S3 arrives. An algorithm to update the state of the dock will suggest itself to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some more pointers that come to mind: keep everything simple! The total number of slots are small and fixed so you shouldn&amp;#39;t need any fancy data structures to keep track of the state of the dock. Use sequential scans for everything and use arrays to represent all the slots. Keep the port state representation and updating separate from the input and output and test it independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds like a really fun project. Thanks for posting! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;any advice would be really appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learn some java and then go on with this assignment. I&amp;#39;m sorry but I see no other way (surely you do not mean someone doing it instead of you)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your question about &amp;quot;arrays, lists, objects&amp;quot; leads to nowhere, I&amp;#39;m sorry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Task&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A port has 3 docks. Each dock has 10 rows of spaces (berths) for ships. The port can
accommodate three sizes of ship; cargo, container, super-container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The rows are made up of 5 small, 3 medium, and 2 large spaces&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; A cargo ship (small) can berth in any available space&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A container ship (medium) can berth in either a medium or large space, but&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;not in small spaces&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A super-container (large) can only berth in large slots. Small and medium&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;spaces cannot be used for super-containers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your implementation should present a menu allowing users to dock (add) ships in the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;port, undock (remove) ships from the port, and report on the status of the port as any&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;point in time. The dock option will allow the user to enter the ship details (name, size)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and then allocate it to the first available space. The undock option will allow the user&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to specify a ship based on its name and then remove it from the list of docked ships.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your algorithm to place ships should be able to reuse spaces that have become 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;vacated. Whenever a ship docks or undocks from the port this should be recorded in a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;port log file (PortLog.txt) that records the time, what space the ship is allocated, and the name of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a ship cannot be accommodated in the port, it should be added to a waiting list until&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;an available space is found. There are ten spaces available for ships to wait outside of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the port. If all of the waiting spaces are occupied and another ship arrives at the port,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;it will be turned away (what they do next is not your problem!). Ships being added to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the waiting list or turned away should also be added to the port log file. Once a&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;suitable space is vacated by another ship undocking, the first ship in the waiting list&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that can fit, according to the rules above, will be allocated the space. The option to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;report on the status of the port should provide a full overview of all ships docked in
the port and on the waiting list at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Appropriate messages and user guidance should be included throughout your&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;implementation. Likewise, the implementation should include input validation and&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;error handling where necessary. It is not necessary to use a GUI in your solution, i.e.
only text-based output is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should first analyse the problem and develop your design based on the PACE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;model (problem, analysis, coding, execution) as used throughout the module. The&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;documentation should include an analysis of the specification, diagrams as necessary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;to describe the classes used, and the core algorithms presented as pseudo code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your test plan should thoroughly evaluate every aspect of your solution and include&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;results of the testing process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further guidance will be provided on how you should document your design and
testing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your question reminded me of those puzzles they used to have us do where you&amp;#39;d start with a grid and color certain columns and rows and some crap and end up with a picture of a dog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No idea what the name for that nonsense was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I personally wouldn&amp;#39;t want to watch that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watch you learn Java? I&amp;#39;m not even sure if I would want to watch myself learn a new language haha how much experience do you have in Java? Are you going off of a book?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash is dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;yeah, but can HTML handle such things like animated flash games? because this kind of app will behave like a game. animated and simple one&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://laracasts.com/"&gt;https://laracasts.com/&lt;/a&gt; taught me most everything I needed. From laravel setup, programming tips, and useful design patterns it has everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe look at some Youtube videos on Laravel? Given the sheer amount of information out there, good and bad, the world is yours for the taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;the correct syntax is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;if (iPartyCount &amp;gt; 2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; iPartyCount &amp;lt; 5)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though your question is already solved, I&amp;#39;d like to give you a piece of advice:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before posting in a programming forum (like here or stackoverflow), google the solution. A simple google query for &amp;quot;Java conditional&amp;quot; would have brought up the Oracle tutorial:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html"&gt;http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where your question is fully answered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an aspiring programmer, you need to learn to search for information by yourself as well as you need to know where to find documentation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first go-to point for Java documentation and tutorials is always &lt;em&gt;Oracle&lt;/em&gt;. They have excellent tutorials for the basic Java stuff as well as the complete JDK reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a programmer you will spend countless hours googling and browsing through documentation, so it&amp;#39;s important to hone those skills as early as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;you need to put iPartyCount twce&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if (iPartyCount &amp;gt; 2 &amp;amp;&amp;amp; iPartyCount &amp;lt;5)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You should find a way (there are probably several...) to start all your requests in parallel, waiting for all of them to finish before returning your result. Your request would be as long as your longest request (+ your own processing overhead), and not the sum of all your requests (+your own overhead)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On solution: &lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html"&gt;https://docs.python.org/2/library/threading.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Try to use map() [0]
[0]&lt;a href="http://chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/"&gt;http://chriskiehl.com/article/parallelism-in-one-line/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, the delay is clearly server side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As others mentioned add parallelism, you could also use Ajax so that they are shown on the page as they finish. It would be a bit more work though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started with a tutorial on youtube and it gave a pretty decent run down on how to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be honest, there&amp;#39;s nothing fresh about COM programming. It&amp;#39;s the same is it ever was. All of the stuff in the older literature still holds true if you are developing a native C++ COM server.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t recall which book I used when I cut my teeth on this 6 years ago. I think this may have been one of them: &amp;quot;Developer&amp;#39;s Workshop to COM and ATL 3.0&amp;quot;, by Andrew Troelsen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MSDN is also a good place to start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms694363(v=vs.85).aspx"&gt;The Component Object Model&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one thing that is new is that you can make .Net types COM-visible. If that&amp;#39;s the intent, you&amp;#39;ll want to check out Troelsen&amp;#39;s other book called, &amp;quot;COM and .Net Interoperability&amp;quot;. It&amp;#39;s also good if you&amp;#39;ll be consuming COM objects from .Net. A lot of pitfalls there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry. Not much of a contribution and you&amp;#39;ve probably found these sources already. Good luck though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m curious about why you want to delve into COM.  Is it just for your own learning experience or are you looking at something professionally with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can look at the &lt;a href="http://edman007.com/article/RC-Sub/AVR-Programming"&gt;AVR servo controller&lt;/a&gt; I wrote for my raspberry pi project. I haven&amp;#39;t posted updates on that recently, but I&amp;#39;ve been doing some work on it recently, and I do have heavy use of interrupts in the AVR code (bitbanged a serial controller and servo controller that runs at the same time using mostly timer driven interrupts). The source is down at the bottom of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;General example assuming AVRs (b/c that&amp;#39;s what your link is about):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;volatile uint32_t tmr_tick = 0;

ISR(TIMER2_OVF_vect)
{
    if (tmr_tick != 0)
        tmr_tick--;
}

void wait(uint32_t ticks)
{
    cli();
    tmr_tick = ticks;
    sei();

    while (tmr_tick != 0)
    {}
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suppose you&amp;#39;ve set up TIMER2 to raise an interrupt every millisecond and now want to use that to implement a &lt;code&gt;wait(ms)&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;cli()&lt;/code&gt; disables/masks interrupts, &lt;code&gt;sei()&lt;/code&gt; enables them. Interrupts that happen between &lt;code&gt;cli()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sei()&lt;/code&gt; are executed after &lt;code&gt;sei()&lt;/code&gt;. So, you can use that to protect critical sections of your code that you don&amp;#39;t want to be interrupted. It&amp;#39;s required in &lt;code&gt;wait()&lt;/code&gt; because you don&amp;#39;t want the interrupt to interfere with the assignment of the value. After that, the function waits until &lt;code&gt;tmr_tick&lt;/code&gt; is decremented to zero. &lt;code&gt;tmr_tick&lt;/code&gt; needs to be &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; to tell the compiler that the value might change without it&amp;#39;s knowledge. You see, C doesn&amp;#39;t care about interrupts and assumes to be alone in the world. That means if &lt;code&gt;tmr_tick&lt;/code&gt; isn&amp;#39;t &lt;code&gt;volatile&lt;/code&gt; the compiler can and will assume that &lt;code&gt;tmr_tick&lt;/code&gt; never changes and won&amp;#39;t bother reading it in the loop over and over again - voilà, infinite loop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geonames probably has what you&amp;#39;re looking for: &lt;a href="http://www.geonames.org/export/"&gt;http://www.geonames.org/export/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you&amp;#39;re trying to do too much too quickly. Firstly, pick a language that&amp;#39;s fairly easy to learn the basics of. I learned originally with the BASIC that shipped in ROM on an 8-bit micro. I worked with that for years until I discovered C at University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d say it doesn&amp;#39;t really matter what the language is as long as it has a lot in common with a lot of other languages. Ie: it isn&amp;#39;t too &amp;#39;quirky&amp;#39;. C is a good choice for a beginner as it&amp;#39;s fairly close to English in many ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, get a book or another reference, such as an online series of articles, and &lt;em&gt;slowly&lt;/em&gt; work through, actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; the examples, compiling them and running the result to see for yourself. Experiment with it, try expanding on examples by adding your own functionality, however small that functionality is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay focussed on that one language. Read other online articles about it to get context. Buy a book on learning it. Follow the path. When you&amp;#39;re ready to expand to other languages, you&amp;#39;ll know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe programming just isn&amp;#39;t your thing?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you know any other languages? Have you built anything else in those languages? I always find it easiest to learn a new language doing something that I know inside and out (in my case, an irc client / bot), I don&amp;#39;t have to worry about the logic/pseudo behind it, so I can just learn the core language principals - in saying that, I&amp;#39;ve ALWAYS struggled trying to learn C++&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would probably suggest getting yourself a book that has the basics and a lot of examples, don&amp;#39;t skip past things you already know, don&amp;#39;t give up when you don&amp;#39;t understand something you&amp;#39;re doing - it might explain itself later on down the track. Doing everything from A-Z in the book will generally show you to build whatever it is they want you to build by the end of it and teach everything you need to know along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Come up with a simple program you want to accomplish and grind it out in whatever language you want. Look up every question you have and work towards your goal. Then you&amp;#39;ll see how everything links together. By simple I mean something like a &amp;quot;movie rental&amp;quot; where you search movies from a list and &amp;quot;rent&amp;quot; them, something like that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you &amp;quot;self-learned&amp;quot; other things? You say &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve never been very good at self learning&amp;quot;; the things you are the most comfortable with, how did you learn those? If you&amp;#39;ve been in a similar situation with other subjects, what things/events/etc got you through it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are dedicated to self learning of programming, it could be helpful to talk with someone you know (or find someone to talk with) who knows how to program, since you could interact and maybe get a different perspective which makes more sense to you / you can relate to better. Maybe some of the course sites you&amp;#39;ve been to have something where you can chat, but this is probably not the same as having a friend or tutor or studygroup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless if a course was &amp;quot;well designed&amp;quot; or got many positive reviews it still might not be great for your [methods of learning] or where you&amp;#39;re at conceptually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you watched any videos, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Op3QLzMgSY"&gt;the Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (SICP) lectures&lt;/a&gt; (there are many hours of such videos, but give it 11 minutes if you want) or try interactive things like &lt;a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming/intro-to-programming/v/programming-intro"&gt;Khan Academy&amp;#39;s programming section?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The conclusion is that either people are in a big rush to learn about programming, or that programming is somehow fabulously easier to learn than anything else.&amp;quot; &lt;a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html"&gt;Peter Norvig&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-2 hours a day/every two days is all I can really allow myself at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What exactly do you expect? You don&amp;#39;t learn to program in 20 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to look at: &lt;a href="http://norvig.com/21-days.html"&gt;http://norvig.com/21-days.html&lt;/a&gt; (Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve tried various sources to learn Python, Ruby and C#&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Language hopping takes even more time...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Motivation is useless, you want &lt;a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2vreu9/how_do_i_stay_motivated/cokd24y"&gt;discipline.&lt;/a&gt; 20 hours is nothing, really. It took me close to 30 to finish codecademy python and the &amp;quot;average course length&amp;quot; is 13 hours. Sure I could have blazed through it in that time by using their forum ever time I got stuck, but you don&amp;#39;t really learn/retain anything that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put in 50 in 1 language and then test yourself with online problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I get the discouraged thing. I feel it too, that&amp;#39;s why you need discipline. Things that are worth learning take time. If you wanted to learn German would you expect to fluently speak it after 20 hours?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are the type of person who does better with a teacher. Have you considered a course at a community college?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have any friends who are programmers? The best way to learn anything is one-on-one tutoring, despite the advances of the internet. I&amp;#39;m not saying you should pay your friends, but maybe you could buy them dinner, or a beer ;), and they&amp;#39;d help you learn programming for an hour or two. Once you grok the basics of programming, it becomes MUCH easier to self-learn the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d also recommend sticking with one language. Python and Ruby, IMO, are both simple and good first programming languages. Once you get decent with one, it&amp;#39;ll be easier to pick up new languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will give you an application that should work, linking the basics of programming to the specifics of an application. I will give you the problem and the solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem:
Take a file of text, any text copy and pasted from any web page, and create another file that lists every word, its letters sorted in alphabetical order, and the number of times it appears in a comma delimited list. Each list should be on its own line. To create this starting file, use copy and paste in notepad, then save.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i.e.
If your file contains the words, &amp;quot;The happy brown dog climbed up the brown tree to get the brown kitty&amp;quot;
Then the program you write should read the file and generate an output file like the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The, eht, 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;happy, ahppy, 1&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;brown, bonrw, 3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the tools that you need to be able to think in to solve this problem and no matter what language you learn, the beginner exercises, tutorials, and books will all teach you how to use these tools independently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;File I/O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;String manipulation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For loops&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arrays&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sorting&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Types/Classes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the solution in plain text thought of in terms of programming: Open and read the contents of the file, put each word that you read in an array of strings, loop over that array of strings, break each word into a sorted array of characters, store the string word and sorted characters in a data structure, store that data structure in a collection, loop over that collection and write every item in that collection out to a file. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Use this pseudo code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;function processFile(string input file, string output file)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;{&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// 0. open file&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// 1. read file content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// 2. process file content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// 3. repeat 1-2 until no more file content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;// 4. write file content&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;}&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you should be able to translate this pseudo code into the specific programming tools without much effort. If you find it difficult, return to the appropriate section of your tutorial and re do the exercises until its easy. 
i.e. step one should be opening the file
step two is figuring out how to read the entire contents of the file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to use a collection object&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to sort a collection&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to split a line of text up into string&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to split a string into characters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to use a dictionary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to loop over an array or dictionary&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;step... how to create a data type...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suggest seeing if you can open the file, read the contents, and then write it all back out without doing anything to the contents as a first milestone. If you can open a file, read the lines, and write those lines back out to another file, you have the file IO part solved! Even if you now change that content before writing, the writing part stays the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second milestone is writing back the same content one word per line. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third milestone is writing back the content one word per line and the letters separated by comma. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4th is writing one word per line and sorted letters&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;5th is writing one word per line, sorted letters, and frequency of word&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;6th is writing one word per line, sorted letters, frequency, and no duplicates (&amp;#39;The, eht, 3&amp;#39; would only appear once in the file)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7th is sorting the words when they are written (example above, &amp;#39;The&amp;#39; would no longer be on the first line of output file, &amp;#39;brown&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;climbed&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;dog&amp;#39; would be the first three lines.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8th is adding the option to sort the words as they are written or by their letters (makes it easy to find anagrams!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get stuck, return to the basic tutorial problems related to what you are stuck on until you can apply what you know to the specifics of what you are stuck on. If you do not know how to open or read content from a file, go back to the file IO exercises. if you can read a line of text from the file, but do not know how to split that string up into the words and those words into characters, go back and do exercises on strings and string manipulation. If you do not know how to store those words so you can process them further before reading the next line, go back to arrays or dictionaries. etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you get to the 8th milestone, then as a bonus you could only print out the anagrams and filter out the words whose letters appear only once. Now you have written an anagram finder application!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;good luck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think I used to be in your shoes. You go through stages of learning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding key concepts of your language. So pluralsight and books will help you with this. With C# you might find videos explaining what classes, methods, inheritence etc is. This will prepare you for stage two. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active learning. I have a feeling that you haven&amp;#39;t quite progressed onto this stage yet. Pick a language that you&amp;#39;re comfortable with. C# is the one I liked. What you need to do is essentially start programming, stage one gives you the theory, but theory can only take you as far as understanding code - not writing it. Find a project. There are some great examples online. I&amp;#39;m currently working on a login form of sorts but there are plenty of ones out there, find one which will hold your attention. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say just start programming like it&amp;#39;s easy, but how do you begin? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You need to research ways of doing your project. Get a overview of how it&amp;#39;ll work from an online forum or something. Then go step by step researching and implementing different methods until you have something usable. This is where a love of documentation is absolutely necessary, all the answers can be found on the various developer networks or within the documentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might help if you told us what sort of problems you are having (&amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t get it&amp;quot; can mean almost anything), but you might be looking for some magic trick that lets you learn it. Alas, there isn&amp;#39;t a magic trick beyond time and effort. Some people do learn faster than others, but learning a new skill is going to require that you put in the effort to do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that the source you are using sucks (many of them do), but it&amp;#39;s also possible that you need more practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s always people better than you at stuff. Who cares. Having started in middle school already gives you a big edge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;The later you get in to it, the bigger this feeling will hurt. Eventually turning to giant boiling regret.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;re only 17. The trick is to just -do-. You&amp;#39;ll get better over time. This is true with any skill or hobby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You already have a head start so it doesn&amp;#39;t matter what those you find are doing. Compared to the % of the global population, you are mile ahead and there are probably people wishing they  had your level of know-how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people in this field didn&amp;#39;t get in to it much later. As even 5-6 years ago, it was no where to be found outside of specific college areas. Let a lone learning it in high school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ok I know exactly what you are talking about and I experienced this when I was 24. It never changes and never ends. Personally I look at it as a sign that I care a lot about my chosen career and use it as a way to better myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I can do anything I want when I want to, i&amp;#39;m comfortable with that. For me my priority is not to spend my life coding, I&amp;#39;m trying to get some other areas fixed up right now. So I have a few friends who do spend any moment they arn&amp;#39;t in school or working building apps and going to competitions etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t honestly say they are better then me when I think about it. They are just doing it more often. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was in college for my programming degree, I fast tracked my education for a few reasons. So I was in classes with people who had at least a year of experience above me, in some cases they had a lot more I would find out. I told myself at the beginning of every class, that I would work hard to be better then those people. It motivated me and drove me and ultimately I succeeded in my goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really have nothing to worry about, if you are worried, use it to motivate you. You can land that job at &lt;em&gt;insert top tech company here&lt;/em&gt; right next to them if you work hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As long as your insecurity is not completely debilitating, it will only motivate you.  Hopefully.  And there will always be someone who writes better code than you.  But that is not the only measure of a good programmer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you searched for &amp;quot;python for loop&amp;quot; on Google? The first link is this one, can you see what&amp;#39;s wrong with your code now ? &lt;a href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop"&gt;https://wiki.python.org/moin/ForLoop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You probably want to change the loop to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for name in names:
    print name
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;JS is the language jQuery is a JS library.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would recommend the &lt;a href="http://smile.amazon.com/JavaScript-JQuery-Interactive-Front-End-Development/dp/1118531647/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1424865820&amp;amp;sr=8-1&amp;amp;keywords=javascript+jquery"&gt;John Duckett&lt;/a&gt; books for the very basics of JS + jQuery&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;#39;t learn a library (jquery is a DOM manipulation / util library for javascript) without learning the language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In learning jQuery, you will inexplicably find yourself learning JavaScript! ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Complete a fairly large project or two. That&amp;#39;s important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depends of the people, the structure they are working in, and the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I usually program on the fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;With experience you&amp;#39;ll see that class diagrams sort of form automatically in your head. Depending on the complexity of the task I might make a high level architecture diagram or just go and get started. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We peer review all code so if someone messes up he&amp;#39;ll have to fix it anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do something in between. I define at a high level view what my solution needs to look like, and write down what its expected functionality is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I will map that high-level view to however many sections I decide to break the code into. Typically I&amp;#39;ll have separate source files for significant components, and a main source file to tie them all together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t start writing code until I&amp;#39;m fairly clear on what that code needs to do, at which point I&amp;#39;ll start defining structures. These structures will probably change during the development process. Some people can plan everything out ahead of time, I&amp;#39;m not one of them. I find the iterative feedback loop of &amp;#39;think -&amp;gt; design -&amp;gt; code -&amp;gt; test -&amp;gt; think&amp;#39; while at all times remembering what it is you are trying to achieve, works well for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mileage may vary, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know I need to learn PHP if I want to be in web programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No you don&amp;#39;t. A lot of languages are suitable for backends, like Python, Ruby, Java, Javascript...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From where you are, trying C# (.NET) may be a sensible choice. C# looks a lot like Java, and it will allow you to use the .Net framework with a different language, so if you already know .Net , it may be a little bit easier for you...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Otherwise, deepening your Javascript experience may be a sensible choice too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or Python :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Python is the one that always comes up as a good &lt;em&gt;first&lt;/em&gt; language. Although C or Java would also be amazing choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who is waffling between self teaching and school this is great!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;x = 1 is a proposition which is equivalent to x == 1 in Javascript. You are confusing it with variable assignment. If in mathematics x = 1 is postulated where x is a &amp;quot;constant&amp;quot; of the theory then doing so is akin to a declaration, but the expression is not the equivalent of x := 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A mathematical variable is not the same thing as a program variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nicely done, thanks! When I get back to my computer I&amp;#39;ll have to go follow your Tumblr. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s also iterated product, which uses the capital Greek letter Pi. Works like summation, except you&amp;#39;re multiplying instead of adding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Function composition ftw!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let f(x) = x + 5; Then f ∘ f(0) = f(0 + 5) = 10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More arcane (but programmers encounter this stuff from time to time): recursive definitions, recurrence relations. Higher order functions, lambda calculus, and functors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about math is you don&amp;#39;t have to worry about running out of memory or time. And pesky things like readable code or maintainability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;nice thanks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nice start on the very basics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m not gonna lie...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I couldn&amp;#39;t quite grasp the for counting function when I was learning C++.  Seeing this and having it related to summation just made something click.  Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is all stuff that anyone who&amp;#39;s graduate high school should know. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#39;t know this, check out sites like Khan Academy, PatrickJMT, Paul&amp;#39;s Online Math Notes, BetterExplained, and MIT OCW Scholar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much! Seriously!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I dropped out of school really early and my maths skill is a big source of anxiety when it comes to learning programming. I&amp;#39;ve gained a little bit of confidence to see that I understand most of this, even if not on the level I need to be in future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Could I suggest one aimed at aspiring game developers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to my recent project, I would suggest adding trigonometry. Drawing circles and manipulating objects in circles definitely requires an understanding of trig. Took me a while to remember how to manipulate the equation for my needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="md"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throw me a PM when you put up part two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
