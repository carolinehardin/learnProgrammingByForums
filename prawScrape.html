</div><div class="md"><p>Well a few things, you are using &quot;int employeeName&quot; are you sure that should be an int and not a string? Also when you are doing inputs</p>

<p>This : 1 2 3 4 [ENTER]  is the same as </p>

<p>This:</p>

<p>1 [ENTER]</p>

<p>2 [ENTER]</p>

<p>3 [ENTER]</p>

<p>So if employeeName is supposed to be an int and you are putting in &quot;sally&quot; the stream is going to be in a bad state (such as <a href="/u/missblit">/u/missblit</a> said)</p>

<p>To build off what i said if you are going to use a name as an input change your name data type into a string. If they need a first and last name then you need to think of another approach, but i&#39;ll give you a big hint. You&#39;ll have to use concatenation. </p>

<p>I have no idea how good a programmer you are, or will be. My advice is to try and gain as much breadth of knowledge as possible, enough to hold a decent conversation about anything technical with any random techie in a bar.</p>

<p>As for programming - it&#39;s as simple as doing it enough that you get good at it, while taking notes and reading up constantly along the way, constantly looking for gems that will help you improve your techniques. I spend an hour a day trawling various tech blogs, programming-related posts on reddit and other sites, even scanning comments on reddit for things I might not know, amongst the chaff. Do that every day, you&#39;ll be fine if you put in the practice as well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Solutions Architect by job description, not a programmer, but I have to implement the solutions I design, and this sometimes entails programming. The best programming I&#39;ve ever done is for my pet projects, out of love for the process. I&#39;m in the middle of my best to date. I&#39;ve spent hours educating young programmers at the company I work for, filling them in on all sorts of wider concepts they are not familiar with, even getting some of them to beta-test some of my personal projects (which I sell commercially from time to time) and I&#39;ve made number of good friends doing it, as well as fostering a great relationship with our CTO who is also their team leader.</p>

<p>There are opportunities a-plenty out there for people willing to go there. I&#39;ve been working for Silicon Valley startups for the last 10 years, it&#39;s been a fantastic adventure and I&#39;m on my third one now. I am a Brit - I live in the UK, 6000 miles+ from the office. Whatever happened to the mouthy know-it-all at my University in my year when I started in 1988, I have no idea. All I know, is that I need a new passport because I&#39;ve had so many great (and sometimes challenging, but that&#39;s the job, right?) adventures all over the world through my jobs that I&#39;ve run out of space for stamps in it.</p>

<p>Your future is yours. Go, embrace it, and prepare yourself for it as best you are able. You are not alone, nobody has the knowledge ahead of time, so you are on an equal footing with your peers. Distance yourself from the oik you mention in your post, focus on what you want to do, find something you want to specialise in, broaden your knowledge and have fun.</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if he&#39;s a millionaire or a pig-muck-shoveller in a few years. The most important thing is that you are doing your best to be who you want to be, and doing things that are worthy of that. </p>

<p>Live long and prosper :-)</p>

<p>You do realize that password managers work by storing encrypted versions of the passwords, right?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you read my response? See the first sentence.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&#39;s exactly the same thing as storing a hash</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. The hash is not reversible. Hashing and encryption are not the same.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>the hash is the password</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. Imagine if I took md5 hashes of images. Would you claim that the hash <em>is</em> the image? No, a hash is not the password.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We use hashing algorithms to generate uniform, complex data from variable, easy-to-remember data.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Definitely not. Consider, for example: I use my password manager to generate a very, very long password, where the bytes are uniformly distributed over possible values. This generated password is uniform and &quot;complex&quot;.</p>

<p>Is it ok for a server to store this password as plaintext? No. And that&#39;s because it&#39;s easy to escalate from reading the stored password to then authenticating as me.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>easier</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They&#39;re both at around the same level in terms of complexity and abstraction. </p>

<p>The opposing design philosophies might affect how easy you find either one. Python is built on the motto &quot;There&#39;s one right way to do it&quot; -- meaning that the community/developers have decided on one standard way to do any given thing, and that can be both refreshingly simple and stifling/restrictive. Ruby has the opposite motto, &quot;Do it your way&quot;, meaning that there are multiple different ways to do any specific thing and that you&#39;re free to pick one of them based on personal preference, appropriateness for situation, style, etc -- making things flexible and customisable, but non-uniform. Which one of those sounds better depends on your tastes.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>bigger community, and most of all - which is more used in practice</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This really depends on which &quot;scene&quot; you&#39;re looking at. Python is more popular in math, science, and engineering, while Ruby is more popular for web development and dev ops. </p>

<p>Really, though, my personal advice would be to just pick one and learn it. Virtually all programmers know more than one language, you&#39;re not committing to your first language forever. The important thing is to learn the fundamental concepts behind programming, the best practices, the algorithms, the solutions to problems. The language-specific stuff is minor in comparison and once you&#39;ve grasped the concepts, learning new languages is relatively easy. For the purposes of learning, Ruby and Python are pretty much identical (they&#39;re both high-level interpreted multi-paradigm languages). </p>

Understanding those things helped me concentrate on solving the problem rather than figuring the mechanics of <code>if</code> statements every single time.</p>

<p>As far as making code efficient, you don&#39;t necessarily need assembly for that.  You might need it if you are counting every clock cycle (in some industries you do that), but otherwise you will never ever have to write assembly for the sake of efficiency.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh, this seems like it could be a really cool resource. I know a few people trying to dive into coding and programming, and this sort of things could really help them get access to a nice range of reads. Easy on the eyes, too.</p>

<p>As for if I think you&#39;re critique matches up, I just got my B.S. in Mathematics so I&#39;d agree that logic, complex problem solving and attention to detail are some of my strong points. I&#39;m also very new to programming and agree that my feel for composition and higher level design needs a lot of work. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Short answer: No</p>

<p>Long answer: I&#39;m a freshman in High School, and I got a C+ on my Honors Algebra 2 class. Yes, I do want to go into CS, and I realize that math is <strong>very</strong> important, so I decided that I would work harder in Math. Think of a failure, as a way to rebuild yourself... Work/study harder, and you&#39;ll do better next time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m cautious now with the number of websites that store in either plain text or encrypted plain text. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Read the FAQ in the sidebar.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You do realize that password managers work by storing encrypted versions of the passwords, right? It&#39;s exactly the same thing as storing a hash for exactly the same reasons you mentioned. As the server shouldn&#39;t have a plaintext copy of the password, the hash <em>is</em> the password. We use hashing algorithms to generate uniform, complex data from variable, easy-to-remember data.</p>

<p>This is terrible, misinformed security advice.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well you should know how looping and most of the other basic stuff involved with programming works. Code academy doesn&#39;t exactly go into algorithms or any of the more complicated stuff in programming, so these courses will probably be difficult at first.

<p>If you want to try something like what these will probably be like do the cs50 course on edx.org while you&#39;re waiting. It&#39;s the intro compsci class at hardvard, if you don&#39;t feel prepared now you will after a few problem sets of cs50!</p>

<p>What the hell?  Being babied sounds exactly like what you&#39;re asking for.  Have you tried <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>?  That&#39;s in the sidebar/FAQ, which you should read.  There are plenty of challenges you can do, if you look for them, and posting stuff here certainly opens it up for critique.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A hash does intrinsically add security by virtue of not being the plaintext password -- admittedly this is mostly a cross-domain issue, but it also prevents an attack from multiple vectors (eg: Cannot call to change account info because I only know the hash, not the passcode itself). The system I described, used in conjunction with origin policies, can effectively negate most sniffing attacks. Even if the original hash is taken, the one-time salt requires an attacker to do at least some reverse engineering (or cracking the hash) in order for the ill-gotten hash to be useful. Both of these are significant gains from &#39;just submitting plaintext.&#39; Plaintext would allow an attacker full access to any part of the system dependent upon the password, the hashing/one-time salting/rehashing adds potentially significant complexity.</p>

<p>The only way I&#39;m aware of to verify identities without both client and server having the same data is asymmetric (public-key) cryptography, but this is typically not trivial to implement as part of a web application, and more to the point: Doesn&#39;t solve the issue of stored credentials.</p>

<p>If you have any suggestions on how to combat the inherent security risk of storing user credentials that would be helpful. Poorly attacking my suggestions is not.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s hard to say what kind of answer you&#39;re looking for.. But most modern games are probably written in languages like JavaScript/C# or Java, if they&#39;re more indie, and C++ if they&#39;re higher budget AAA stuff. Most of the time developers will use libraries/frameworks that do a lot of the necessary low level logic for them, so that they can focus on the gameplay features. For example, a developer might not bother working out the intricacies of collision detection if someone else has done it, so they&#39;ll get a physics engine. They might not bother working out how to deal with low level OpenGL code, so they&#39;ll use a graphics engine. Even non developers will have heard of these engines - Unity, Unreal Engine, CryEngine, etc. Some companies will make their own engines from scratch, others will pay for existing ones (or use free ones such as Unity, which is why it&#39;s very popular for indie developers)</p>

</div><div class="md"><ol>
<li><p>You open with an apology for the post instead of just making it a more intelligent post that doesn&#39;t need an apology.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s chock full of with bs that&#39;s irrelevant, like you&#39;re too lazy to just weed out the crap.</p></li>
<li><p>It&#39;s not a question about learning how to program.</p></li>
<li><p>You don&#39;t appear to have done any groundwork on your own, like comparing libraries yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Right in the sidebar of <a href="/r/gamedev">/r/gamedev</a> it says &quot;Discuss game engines or libraries&quot;.</p></li>
<li><p>Your requirements are vague enough that even you should be able to tell it&#39;d be hard to get a good recommendation for whatever it is you want.</p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="md"><p>It certainly does seem like an edge case. And, as a programmer who has written literally <em>dozens</em> of lines of code, I know that the edge cases never really matter.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think it&#39;s a valid point to raise. I also think the main challenge with this is that mentoring can be time consuming, and is a commitment. While I dip in and out of phases of contributing towards solutions to peoples&#39; problems here, I know that I couldn&#39;t commit to a mentor level, and I suspect many programmers who are technically able to act as mentors are in the same boat. After all, most of us have full time jobs, side projects, lives and families!</p>

<p>Perhaps a better request would be for new programmers who are learning, to buddy-up and work on things together. Having a problem looked at by two people is often more than twice as productive as one, if only because it&#39;s a great form of rubber-duck debugging.</p>

<p>Then if you both get stuck, the posts you make are more likely to be less trivial than some we see in here, and also there is likely to be more context in the post.</p>

<p>Just a thought :-)</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Our instructor has not taught us another way to end the program</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just delete <code>system(&quot;PAUSE&quot;);</code>. It is non-portable and unnecessary. You don&#39;t need it. Remove it. Highlight it and press the Delete key.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t need a special &quot;way to end the program.&quot; When execution reaches the end of your <code>main</code> function, the program ends.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Our instructor has not taught us another way to end the program, but ill go ahead and look into it for my own knowledge.</p>

<p>As for the failure, she told us for now to assume they will only enter integers and negative numbers, i know once a char is entered the thing crashes. </p>

<p>Not sure how to look into that at the moment, but I will save this information for sure.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can try going through the problems on the Project Euler website (on mobile so I can&#39;t link) and <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I was trying to represent decCosts as currency once I run the program, is there a way I could do that?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s an easy hole to fall into. I did it a little bit at my last place. Learned what it was like to work under such an attitude at the next place (for a bit). My soft skills are much better than they used to be now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Java recently implemented lambda support. It basically wraps the command pattern (which was how Java previously did callbacks). So all those places that previously required an anonymous class can use a much more compact lambda.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also possible to create Android apps with a different language that compiles to run on a JVM. For example, you could write an app in Scala, which has much strong functional programming (and operator overloading and type coercion and numerous other features that make it much less verbose than Java).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Now consider the other two things I pointed out:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If the user enters something that cannot be converted to an <code>int</code>, then <code>cin</code> will fail and one or more of the variables <code>A</code>,&nbsp;<code>B</code>, and&nbsp;<code>C</code> will be uninitialized. You do not check for <code>cin</code> failure, and if this occurs you will be attempting to read the value of an uninitialized variable when you test the values of <code>A</code>,&nbsp;<code>B</code>, and&nbsp;<code>C</code>. Attempting to read the value of an uninitialized variable leads to undefined behavior, which means you have absolutely no guarantees about the behavior of any part of your program.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t include <code>system(&quot;PAUSE&quot;);</code> at the end. That is non-portable and unnecessary.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><div class="md"><p>Actually, that makes a lot of sense. I guess since I&#39;m in my first post-secondary job I&#39;m not doing a lot &quot;with my degree&quot; in that sense working on websites. Which kind of scares me a little bit. I don&#39;t want to lose all of what I studied for so long and not use it. What I&#39;m doing at my job, a lot of it has some indirect use of knowledge from school but not a lot of direct use.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry I might be a little stupid, I got now lol. Thanks for breaking it down.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>But you <strong>don&#39;t need</strong> <code>else if</code>.</p>

<p>If the <code>if</code> block doesn&#39;t run, you already know the condition <code>A &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; B &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; C &gt;= 1</code> is false! If it were true, then the <code>if</code> block would have been run, and the <code>else</code> part would have been skipped entirely. So it&#39;s pointless to test the condition <code>A &lt;= 0 || B &lt;= 0 || C &lt;= 0</code> in the <code>else</code> block—you already know that condition is true, because if it were false you wouldn&#39;t even be there!</p>

<p>You want the second block to be run whenever the condition <code>A &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; B &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; C &gt;= 1</code> is false, right? So:</p>

<pre><code>if (A &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; B &gt;= 1 &amp;&amp; C &gt;= 1)
{
    // stuff
}
else
{
    // other stuff
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Is there any chance of letting users add multiple courses to their page? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why not use an <code>else</code> instead of a separate, disjoint <code>if</code>?</p>

<p>Your comments are excessively verbose. Google for how you should comment code. Comments like &quot;Store into Variable init ...&quot; are completely unnecessary and just waste the reader&#39;s time.</p>

<p>Why do you put all your strings in variables? Would be more readable to just include the literals where you need them.</p>

<p>Avoid <code>system(&quot;pause&quot;)</code>. Google for why.</p>

<p>Using <code>&quot;\n&quot;</code> is preferable over <code>std::endl</code>. While it doesn&#39;t make a difference here, <code>std::endl</code> flushes the output buffer and will ruin performance. Not even more readable since you would have had string literals that you could slap a <code>\n</code> to, anyway.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I changed it to else if and it worked</p>

<pre><code>if (A &gt;=1 &amp;&amp; B &gt;=1 &amp;&amp; C &gt;= 1)

    cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; init &lt;&lt; youhaveent &lt;&lt; A &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; B &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; C &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; endl; // Call or Display these variables with spaces between them
}
else if (A &lt;= 0 || B &lt;= 0 || C &lt;= 0) // If number is less than or equal to 0, then display variable invalidchar (see above).
{
    cout &lt;&lt; invalidchar &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Nope, that&#39;s perfect the way you have it. No need for arrays or anything, keep things as simple as possible. Now you can declare two complex numbers because you&#39;ve got a constructor. Finally we can build the add method to add them together. What is that method going to look like? What type is it going to return, and what will its parameters be?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry to ask the obvious, but just to make sure, you had to fork out the $200 to register for the PowerShell course, correct?

<p>EdX has two FAQs, one that says &quot;all EdX courses are free to audit&quot; (clearly written first and presumably no longer true), and then another that says (paraphrased) &quot;Professional education courses are our new way of experimenting with generating revenue&quot;.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That is not how an <code>if</code>/<code>else</code> statement works. You don&#39;t put a condition after <code>else</code>. The <code>else</code> block will run whenever the <code>if</code> condition is false. That&#39;s what the word &quot;else&quot; means. The <code>else</code> block does not need its own condition.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, I don&#39;t meant to sound flippant, but web developers practically grow on trees.  You don&#39;t even need a Computer Science degree to break into that field, plenty of people learn from web-based tutorials and trial-and-error.  There is an extremely low barrier to entry.</p>

<p>Java development, on the other hand, has a much higher barrier to entry.  For one thing, Java is not quite so &quot;cool&quot; anymore.  Beginners may be exposed to it in school, or maybe pick up just enough to crap out an Android app.  However, they have to cut against peer pressure somewhat, and go a bit further out of their way to <strong>really</strong> learn it compared to the past.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is significantly harder to break into Java development without a degree (not completely impossible, but you never completely overcome that H.R. Drone stigma no matter how much experience you build).  So there is less competition from self-taught people wandering in off the street.</p>

<p>Most importantly of all, a lot of the experience of developing business software can <strong>only</strong> be obtained by working in a large company environment.  Anyone can build a JavaScript single-page application on their laptop, with client-side logic just as sophisticated any any billion-dollar startup.  There are a ton of web-based resources that will walk you right through it.  </p>

<p>But if you want to build a service-oriented architecture around an ESB, using BPEL or WS-Orchestration... if you want learn about SSO and federated identity managment... if you want to really internalize the design considerations when the deployment target is a server cluster... then there isn&#39;t a CodeSchool or CodeAcademy for that.  You pretty much have to stumble into a junior-level job in a big company which deals with those things, and then parlay that into a senior-level job somewhere else a few years later.</p>

<p>Note that I&#39;m not saying that web developers are <em>dumber</em> than enterprise business software developers.  Actually, it can often be the opposite... I&#39;ve met a lot of really brilliant Ruby developers, and I&#39;ve worked with a lot of lazy Java bums who are just phoning it in and haven&#39;t learned anything new in years.  However, salaries are not a factor of how smart or driven one is.  They are instead a factor of supply and demand.  Fields with a higher barrier of entry are going to command better salaries than fields with a much lower barrier of entry.</p>

<p>What exactly do I have to do with $ra? I know it&#39;s used like a return statement but the way you put it makes it seem like I have to save something to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <code>jal</code> instruction is what loads the value into the <code>$ra</code> register to begin with. That&#39;s the difference between <code>jal</code> and a normal jump: <code>jal</code> not only jumps, but also remembers where the jump was, by putting the address into <code>$ra</code>, so that the routine that has been jumped to can then jump back by using <code>jr $ra</code>. That&#39;s how subroutines work.</p>

<p>So the value in <code>$ra</code> still has to be there when you get to the <code>jr $ra</code> at the end of the subroutine. So if you do something inside the subroutine that changes the value in <code>$ra</code>, you have to make sure that you save the original value first, and put it back in <code>$ra</code> before the end of the subroutine, so that you don&#39;t end up returning to the wrong place.</p>

<p>And since a subroutine call is precisely the sort of thing that changes the value in <code>$ra</code>, that means that if a subroutine needs to call another subroutine (or call itself again as in this case), then it needs to save the value in <code>$ra</code> before the call, and then put it back in <code>$ra</code> before it returns.</p>

<p>And since this needs to be able to work no matter how many levels deep the subroutine calls go, the only sensible place to save the <code>$ra</code> values is on the stack. This is just the sort of thing the stack is for after all: temporary storage kept for the duration of subroutine calls, separate for every call.</p>

<p>Now, your reading material has to have gone through subroutine calls and the stack in some detail before this assignment, so I suggest you go over it again to see how to save registers on the stack.</p>

It is the fact that reading the stored data (hash) doesn&#39;t allow you to escalate into a more privileged position (knowing the password) that adds security.

<p>No. Generating a hash doesn&#39;t implicitly add security. The point of <em>storing</em> a hash is that if somehow someone were to read a hash (looking at the stored data, grab a database dump), they can&#39;t immediately escalate into a privileged position (logging in as the user).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>There are a bunch of ways to do this. The easiest way would probably be to just use PHP/MySQL like you already have. An alternative way would be to use Sockets. I&#39;ll go over the MySQL/PHP way.</p>

<p>First, build a table with all your questions in it. Simple, flat file, organise however you want -- have difficulties, categories, whatever. Easy so far. </p>

<p>Then, I&#39;d build a table to contains lists of questions, and a PHP script to generate appropriate lists based on category, difficulty or whatever. This table would contain foreign keys of N questions and would be used as the list of questions in a game. This table could also potentially have NULLable fields with the answers to each question if you have two players per game, but if you want N players you&#39;ll need to make a different table for answers. So this table is a list of questions that will be linked to a game. </p>

<p>Assuming an N player setup, with each &#39;game start&#39; you select a group using whatever matchmaking criteria you want, and build it into a game.</p>

<p>Build that group of selected players into a table that has a foreign key for each player and a primary key (game id or something); and also a foreign key to a list of questions. </p>

<p>So at this stage, we have our players matched up in a group, they are linked to a list of questions, and when they answer each question it goes into a table too (either the question list for 2 players or a new table with &quot;answers&quot; for n). </p>

<p>That&#39;s basically the core of the game. Now to add some &quot;gameplay&quot; like timers or turns or something this is also pretty easy. Just add a &quot;current turn&quot; into the database which could just be an integer saying which player in the group is currently having their turn. The timer can be client side, but a dick could easily hack it; I wouldn&#39;t worry though. A PHP script could increment this &quot;current turn&quot; and make sure it wraps around based on the number of players. </p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty straight forward if you look at it from a long way away, and there are millions of different ways to do this. Procedural or functional programmers would probably cringe hard at what I wrote, but what I&#39;ve written is a very simple way to accomplish what I believe you want. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Both. </p>

<p>There is no need to create an array of continents and then use that when querying the DB. One query is going to be better than seven. (You&#39;re going to spend far more cycles building and tearing down DB connections than actually querying)</p>

<p>This is extremely premature optimization. You&#39;re coding like you know better than the DB. You don&#39;t.</p>

<p>Granted, this is a contrived example with an extremely small dataset. But no one optimizes around sets of 200 records. If you were dealing with &quot;real&quot; data, your method would most likely introduce complexity and inefficiency. Let the DB do what it&#39;s good at.</p>

<p>EDIT:  Adding a real-world example.</p>

<p>I used to work on a web application that was a CRM.  This app had some pretty strict auditing requirements, so we tracked everything.  </p>

<p>When users with Administrative rights made changes, they were collected into change sets, which were applied upon review and approval.  So a particular content repository can have many change sets, and each change set can have many changes.  </p>

<p>Administrative users could review these change sets for their content repositories.  However, they could only see change sets if they had administrative rights to everything that was touched by that change set. So if the admin user does not have rights on any content item touched by any change in that change set, they can&#39;t see the change set at all.  (I know this is weird, I didn&#39;t write the requirements)  Now, that access bit wasn&#39;t very common, as it was rare to have any restrictions on admin users.  But it did happen occasionally.</p>

<p>We ran into an issue where occasionally when admin users tried viewing the change history, it would literally crash a web server.  The Java process would saturate it&#39;s memory heap and die.  This wasn&#39;t common, maybe once a week.  (on a product with 30-50k daily users)  We finally tracked it to a particular content store, which was very active and very long lived.  So there were literally thousands of change sets with thousands of changes each.  It worked fine if the admin user had full rights, but if they were restricted, it would consistently crash whatever server tried to hit it.  </p>

<p>Turns out, some Java dev decided he knew better than the database.  (A big expensive Oracle RAC cluster)  So instead of writing a complex SQL query that would return a list of viable change sets, he just pulled everything into Java objects and started looping to check every single change record to see if the user had access to it&#39;s target.  This doesn&#39;t work well when you&#39;re dealing with what ended up being hundreds of millions of records.  </p>

<p>I wrote a SQL query that, given a user_id, would return a list of unique change_set_id&#39;s that the user should see.  It ran in about 1/10th of a second.  That result set was then used to populate the list the user saw in the UI.  </p>

<p>Just an example, I searched Ruby on Rails and was taken <a href="http://techether.com/subjects/1-ruby-on-rails">here</a>. If I clicked the &quot;Web Applications&quot; tag then maybe I would be taken to all web applications that have content on the site.</p>

<p>I also think a &quot;sort by&quot; feature within each framework/language would be useful, perhaps to organize resources by add date, rating, free/price, etc.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Have you taken any reasonable steps to debug this, like making manual requests with curl?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll want to hash the password using whatever cryptography you prefer, then compare it to the hash you store on the server that contains a unique salt (re-hash the hash with the salt). I think the best practice now-a-days includes originally hashing with a salt value and rehashing with a one-time salt (usually generated based off of the time) on the client and comparing that one-time-only hash to the one you make on the server. EG:</p>

<p>User saves &#39;password&#39;, stored as &#39;sadfihge&#39; (hashed(password+salt)) on both client &amp; server, when user logs into server it submits &#39;hashed(sadfihea+124732)&#39; where 124732 is some unique time-based salt that the server also knows, so it compares any request to &#39;hashed(sadfihe+124732)&#39; or &#39;hashed(hashed(password+salt)+unique_salt).</p>

<p>Every <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">hashing algorithm</a> should give the same output for any given input, that&#39;s a main reason why they&#39;re useful. Storing user credentials is always a security risk, this method simply makes it more difficult to get the plaintext password or to gain access by MITM attacks.</p>

<p>This. This is what I&#39;m going through right now, and it&#39;s why I don&#39;t sleep at night.

</div><div class="md"><p>Now this is an answer! This affirms the answer that I was starting to formulate with the other responses. Now, one more specific question I have is, what if there is not an instance of &#39;A&#39; and I tried to assign a.b = c.d.e? Is that an object reference exception? </p>

<p>Even more specifically, can I only get null pointers when referencing properties? Eg I can only get null pointers when trying to reference b, d and e (given that they are null).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Than make a class called ComplexNumbers and create a method called add(). Some psedu-code:</p>

    public ComplexNumber add(ComplexNumber num) {
        return new ComplexNumber(this.imaginaryPart + num.imaginaryPart, this.realPart + num.realPart);

</div><div class="md"><p>Your constructor is simply the function that is run when you create a new instance of the class.  It doesn&#39;t have to do anything.  If you don&#39;t need to initialize anything, leave the constructor empty.</p>

<p>edit: it doesn&#39;t really &quot;allow objects to be written later in the code&quot;.  I&#39;m not sure what you mean by that though... it allows an object to be instantiated (created).  The access modifier of the constructor defines what code can create it (a private constructor can only be called by the class itself, for example), and the parameters of the constructor define what can be passed as parameters to the object when instantiated.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking to get python running smoothly under Windows, I would <em>strongly</em> suggest using Anaconda.  Since Windows doesn&#39;t really have a package manager like most OSS *nix systems do, it greatly eases the pain of trying to get the right versions installed and working together.  </p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want/need the full blown Anaconda install (includes PyQT and lots of science/math stuff like numpy and scipy) there is always Miniconda - same foundation, just more ala carte (install what you need rather than everything). </p>

<p>Definitely ditch Windows XP, it&#39;ll be in your way and force you to use outdated tools since Microsoft has dropped supporting it. Regular Ubuntu works fine with some tweaks; that&#39;s probably true of most flavors, but the large support structure for Ubuntu makes it easy to find help for performance/hardware issues.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve had lots of experience using/running *nix systems so this was  an overdue change for me, but you&#39;ll be pretty comfortable with it inside a week or two. The big upside is most tech/dev tools (not MS-specific) are geared towards BSD/*nix systems, you get modern behavior (big plus from XP), it&#39;ll be way more stable (aside from occasional issues with the graphics driver I only have to reboot for major updates), and you&#39;ll appreciate the OS design more as you get further into programming (Windows has borrowed heavily to make new Windows versions suck less).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Ahhh, I&#39;m starting to see what&#39;s going on. So, it could be a reference to an attribute, like list.length or a person.name. So b could point to null if that attribute hasn&#39;t been assigned, and same with c, d and e.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with the form of the variable assignment in this question.</p>

<p>What do you mean? It&#39;s just a standard variable assignment. It assigns the value of <code>c.d.e</code> to <code>a.b</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Programming language grammar/syntax is <em>less</em> important than human language! Whereas we need to follow common rules to communicate concepts and ideas clearly, the computer doesn&#39;t know or care about all that. Machine languages are -- in a simplistic sense -- lists of instructions.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important you understand the concepts of a loop, variables, design patterns, and all that jazz, but the way you communicate the program structure matters far less than what you&#39;re doing and why you&#39;re doing it. If you can write psuedocode to express what you want to happen then matching it to an implemented language should be a mostly-straightforward task.</p>

<p>Kind of like taking a paragraph in English and translating it to Latin -- you&#39;ve got to apply what you&#39;ve learned to see any progress. Do that enough times and you&#39;ll be reading the Aeneid (coding your app) before long.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Well, before you go ahead and make any methods to add complex numbers together, you&#39;re going to want to decide how your complex number class will store the numbers. There are two integer parts to a complex number, right? So first write a class with those as the data members.</p>

<p>Seems incredibly forward, I know, but 65% of the time it works all the time. If they are brash enough to tell you no, they probably would&#39;ve made a poor mentor anyway.

I did have some Linux experience at the time, but am far from experienced. I originally went with ubuntu, but when I upgraded again to the version with the unity interface (which the current ubuntu still has) I found it way to resource intensive. I switched to Mint, and really like it. I also installed in on a friend&#39;s ancient laptop, and it worked really well to. She had zero Linux experience before hand, but picked it up pretty quickly.

</div><div class="md"><p>The question has nothing specifically to do with linked lists. When would you get a null pointer exception? When something is null.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d necessarily agree that Java wants things done &quot;the right way.&quot; Java wants things done the <em>object oriented way</em>, always and without exception -- and in my admittedly limited Android experience, that made some things painfully awkward.</p>

<p>A simple example is a callback. IIRC, in the Android API you had to do callbacks by defining an inline class with a single method. That&#39;s a terrible misuse of OOP, IMO -- it&#39;d be much cleaner to allow the user to pass an anonymous function, but Java is (was?) fussy about such things. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>powershell?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/powershell">http://www.reddit.com/r/powershell</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s an interesting point. I do mostly python, so the overhead to just debugging a problem is so low, don&#39;t even have to worry about the compile time. With big data sets it can be slow to debug, but I wouldn&#39;t imagine any slower than using a compiled language.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>actually the website already exists, and i am the user trying to automate file uploads to it</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sure, that&#39;d be fine. It&#39;d be a little redundant, though, since you can  already easily add primitive ints using the + operator. Why not create a class for imaginary numbers or fractions? That would be a more useful exercise, I think.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, it depends.  Your primary language(s) depend on the nature of the work you&#39;re doing (or want to be doing).  Business software is usually written in Java, with C# being in second place.  Mobile development is usually written in Java or Objective-C, with some new options emerging.  Video games are usually written in C++.  </p>

<p><em>Web</em> development is all over the place, very fragmented.  Companies or teams who focus on that exclusively tend to favor Ruby, Python, Node.js, or PHP.  More often than not, though... in larger businesses, web development is an afterthought that gets bolted on to the business software development.  So you have Java or .NET guys writing web apps with Java or C#, and knowing just enough jQuery to get by on the client-side.</p>

<p>So I would tell you to think about which sort of industry you want to work in, and then focus your personal learning on whichever language is most dominant in that field.  If you have no idea which field you want to work in (I didn&#39;t when I was in school), then instead experiment with several languages and focus on the ones you most enjoy.  By putting them on your resume, you&#39;ll probably find that your career takes you in that direction whether you plan for it or not.  </p>

<p>(<em>Bear in mind though, languages which are most fun when doing simple tutorials often come up short when building large applications.  That&#39;s why Java and C# aren&#39;t considered very cool by beginners today, yet will still probably dominate the business world for the next two or three decades at least.</em>)</p>

<p>The best frameworks to learn obviously depend on your chosen language(s).  In most situations, there are one or two frameworks which are completely dominant today... and one or two which point the way toward trends which look like they may dominate in the future.  </p>

<p>I&#39;m a Java guy, so I would say that you MUST be familiar with Spring and JEE.  But it&#39;s also good to explore the Play Framework, because that&#39;s where things seem to be going (most of its good ideas are already being pulled into Spring).  If you&#39;re a Ruby guy then you no doubt learn Rails, but Sinatra seems to be the model that most other frameworks are emulating now.  Some languages have much less diversity, and therefore make choices for you (e.g. if you&#39;re a C# guy then you learn ASP.NET, period).  It all depends.  Start with a particular language.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>My take on Codecademy is that it&#39;s good for getting your feet wet, but you&#39;re still going to have to independently study to get any good. I started Ruby but it&#39;s been put on the back burner because I&#39;m really working with JavaScript right now, but I think the course is comparable... maybe a little easier because if you grasp certain concepts from JavaScript, then all you&#39;re learning is different code.</p>

<p>But when I got to that point in Codecademy, I really had to ask myself - do I just want to finish everything on the site just to finish it? Or do I want to be good at programming. I can FizzBuzz, but that alone won&#39;t get me a job. It&#39;ll help, but I want to develop an app and that will help a lot more.  And I need JavaScript for what I&#39;m doing.</p>

<p>I would do the Ruby course if I were you, since you know you want to do Rails. But I&#39;d also take the opportunity to figure out what it is you want to do with your coding skills and work towards it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, you could do that.  What&#39;s the problem?  You have our permission to proceed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What if I was to make a separate class for ints and name it e.g. wholenum?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yep. And it&#39;s not even so much about knowing how to do it, it&#39;s about seeing those words pop up on the screen. If this little exercise doesn&#39;t trigger an endorphin rush and at least one creative idea then it&#39;s an easy X in the list of &quot;things I want to do.&quot; Still need to hook a database into it, though.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can probably use flatMap to make this simpler.  Or you could use a wrapper function that passes the accumulator array to your current function and then returns the array when it&#39;s done.</p>

<p>edit: I think based on what wikipedia says about this algo, you can just return the accumulator array t the end of your function, and replace output(a) with adding the array to the accumulator aray/list, which makes the end solution a simple, direct translation of what wikipedia has.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have a problem.  I was pointing out that almost no one will want to use this, so there&#39;s no point in making it just for you.

<p>But, assuming you can&#39;t retire the damn thing, I would recommend that you 1). Back up all your shit on there to Drive/Dropbox/SpiderOak/etc.</p>

<p>2). Go grab a nice lightweight linux distribution with similar UI to XP. The <a href="http://lubuntu.net/">Lubuntu</a> project springs to mind (Easy to use for beginners, not nerfed, super light on resources).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, you can&#39;t. Java integers come in two types: primitive integers and the Integer class (Java automatically switches back and forth between these two as needed, which is called &quot;autoboxing&quot;).</p>

<p>Adding an &quot;add()&quot; method to the Integer class would mean changing an existing class, which you can&#39;t really do in Java.</p>

<p>You could, however, create a new Integer class that also represented an integer and give that class an add method.</p>

I just think sometimes a short concise nudge in the right direction is the correct answer. (Especially in this case since I got the idea that he actually knew this answer he was just suffering from staring at his code for too long.)</p>

<p>It is often how I was helped when I was first learning with forums. People would give me short answers to point me at the most obvious problem, and I would try and figure it out and come back if I was really stumped. If you notice I was the first response on the post and it was mere minutes after his post was made. So while I would be willing to walk him through. It looked like to me that he really just needed to take a step back and read line by line. I know especially when I was starting out I had trouble seeing the forest for the trees sometimes and I didn&#39;t need a paragraph long description of why my float variable kept losing its decimals, I just needed someone to say, &quot;You need to check the types of all your numbers.&quot; </p>

<p>I don&#39;t know anything about your situation, but I&#39;m not sure that matters have actually changed.  I don&#39;t talk salary with people at work... but from what I&#39;ve seen on the Glassdoor.com salary surveys for my company, the junior guys seem to be around $60k today.  So I guess that is a decline if you factor in 15 years of zero growth against inflation, but I don&#39;t think salaries have DECLINED in raw dollar amounts.</p>

<p>However, things vary widely depending on language and industry.  C++ guys working in systems programming or finance make insane money.  A Java business software guy at the same experience level does great.  An equivalent .NET guy makes about 90% of what the Java guy makes.  Ruby/Python/PHP/Node guys are all over the map... supposedly they can make a lot of money if they hustle in the freelance market, but if they work on salary then it&#39;s usually at a gargantuan discount to the C++/Java/C# people.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Man, I really messed this up while writing this out. I think part of my confusion may have come from that as well.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Debatable. You can definitely make an argument for not spoon feeding people the answers, but at the same time, it&#39;s entirely possible he has read about constructors but the tutorial failed to explain the return type thing (or he simply didn&#39;t notice it). In that case pointing out how it works is completely fine, because it fills in the spot that he doesn&#39;t understand yet. </p>

I know for instance that there are very few things you could throw at me that I couldn&#39;t figure out two or three ways to accomplish fairly quickly. Though I&#39;m not an anxious person by nature, so mileage may vary.</p>

<p>It is certainty important the higher you go to exude confidence though, even in failure. The trick is not getting full of yourself... Which is something I think most people at that stage struggle with at least a little. When you&#39;re the person everyone goes to for advise on how to do stuff, it&#39;s easy to get into that. This why I think it&#39;s important to realize there are people who are always better than you. It frees you to make mistakes sometimes, and keeps you from being an insufferable prick to work with. ;-)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Do you have any code to show us? What do you have so far?</p>

<p>The way you&#39;ve got it right now, <em>add()</em> is a method that would be in whatever class a comes from - however, there is no <em>add()</em> method built into the int primitive type. You can make a method <em>add(a,b)</em> instead, and put it inside a class that you define, like so:</p>

<pre><code>class Example {
    Example() {}
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then you can just call Example.add(a,b) wherever you want to add two integers.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I think you misunderstood my comment.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Think of it as a series of instructions for how to turn the variable into a primitive type.</p>

<pre><code>int x;
</code></pre>

<p><code>x</code> is an <code>int</code>.</p>

<pre><code>int *x;
</code></pre>

<p><code>*x</code> is an <code>int</code>, so <code>x</code> is a pointer to <code>int</code>.</p>

<pre><code>int x[];
</code></pre>

<p><code>x[0]</code> is an <code>int</code>, so <code>x</code> is an array of <code>int</code>.</p>

<pre><code>void (*foo)(int);
</code></pre>

<p>When you dereference <code>foo</code> and call it with an <code>int</code>, you get <code>void</code>. So <code>foo</code> is a pointer to a function like <code>void foo(int input);</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What I meant is in that case, your question more or less answers itself. If you&#39;re able to build your skills and find a decent, stable job that pays well doing software development for a company that doesn&#39;t ever expect you to be on-site and won&#39;t expect you to be working all the time, then you&#39;ll have satisfied your requirement for feasibility. If you&#39;re unable to set this up for yourself, then at least you won&#39;t have gotten yourself into a jam somewhere halfway across the US.</p>

<p>In my experience, jobs like these aren&#39;t quite unicorns -- they do exist -- but I&#39;ll guess they comprise less than a percent of the software jobs out there, and tend to be more available to experienced workers who have demonstrated their competance and reliability. Maybe I&#39;m just out of touch.</p>

<p>Honestly, if you&#39;re in any programming degree eventually you&#39;ll have to start learning more advanced topics like system architecture, Assembly, OS, how to write a shell / compiler, just basic things. I can&#39;t see you not learning C at some point, it&#39;s pretty important. You&#39;d definitely have a leg up if you learn it sooner than later.</p>

<p>Having learned Java (great!) and python, you should look to more advanced topics, harder to use languages, less abstracted.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As the others have said, it&#39;s implementation-defined whether you can cast an integer to a pointer and back.  However, on most any non-museum, non-embedded platform you&#39;re likely to encounter, a pointer will be at least as wide an <code>int</code>, and often wider, so in those cases the implementation will virtually always define this as having meaningful semantics.  The machine has registers, and those registers don&#39;t differentiate between integers and pointers; it&#39;s all just bits.  The only time you&#39;d have to worry about it is if you were dealing with some kind of bizarro-world platform.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t correct.  x is a pointer, y is not.  The whitespace doesn&#39;t matter.  This is why people prefer to put the * next to the variable name:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Reads as &quot;intstar x, y&quot; which is misleading.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>6.3.2.3 Pointers</p>

result is implementation-defined, might not be correctly aligned, might not point to an

</blockquote>

<p>The downside of the OP&#39;s suggested solution is that there is a race condition unless he/she uses additional synchronization to ensure that the variable <code>i</code> is not accessed after the parent thread exits the scope.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Strictly speaking, casts of ints to/from pointers are <em>implementation defined</em> behaviour, not undefined behaviour. The difference being that while it is not portable, the compiler must defined and document the behaviour, and it&#39;s pretty likely to be predictable (the main surprise is likely to be the relative sizes of integers and pointers, which is why <code>intptr_t</code> exists).</p>

<p>In this sense, OP&#39;s code is not better, because of the issues pointed out by ponyoink below: there&#39;s no guarantee that the variable the pointer points to will be around when the thread starts executing, and is thus likely to invoke undefined behaviour.</p>

I have a lot more trouble reading and comprehending English text on a computer screen when I can see an on-screen timer ticking down than I do reading it in print - in print I can forget about <em>everything</em> except what I&#39;m supposed to be focusing on. I would be a strong advocate for giving students the option of doing their tests on paper whenever it&#39;s a viable option over using a computer.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Many good responses so far.</p>

<p>I think one of the complexities is that there are several similar but different kinds of senior programmers.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll take my stab at defining the differences as I see the terminology.</p>

<p>A senior <em>programmer</em>, literally, would in my book be someone who is an expert in the use of a particular set of programming languages, and experienced enough in applying them to not just <em>follow</em> technical direction but to <em>set</em> it within that context.  They sort of have one excellent hammer in their toolkit, it&#39;s all they have, and all problems are nails to them, but damn it&#39;s a nice hammer.</p>

<p>A senior <em>software engineer</em> tends to focus less on a core set of languages.  They have a broader skillset and theoretical background that lets them slide easily between languages and frameworks, and enables them to not just <em>follow</em> but <em>set</em> technical direction across a range of contexts, but generally still within the overall context of programming and technical development.  Their hammer is not as good as a specialized programmer&#39;s, but they also have pliers and screwdrivers, and they are very good at the combination.</p>

<p>A senior <em>software developer</em> is even broader in scope than a senior software engineer.  If a client has only a two-sentence spec for their entire project, that might frustrate a programmer and annoy a software engineer, but it would be more than adequate for a software developer.  They&#39;re experts in the tremendously broad context of exploring problem spaces and conceiving of and implementing technological solutions that fit those spaces.  But they pay for this skill breadth with an even greater lack of skill depth than a software engineer.  Their toolkit is huge and packed with both hard and soft skills, but the qauality of those tools can vary tremendously.</p>

<p>Thus, to me, these terms describe a spectrum.</p>

<p>Not of competence but of interest and scope.  Of where, in a project&#39;s timeline, does each person best get involved.</p>

<p>For the record, I&#39;ve never met or heard of anyone who is an expert at all three contexts, and I&#39;ve similarly known very few people who only fit into a single one to any useful degree.  Usually it&#39;s a bit of a mix, with one core preference.</p>

<p>Now, the difference between junior and senior varies accordingly between those groups, but in general it comes down to this:</p>

<p>A junior whatever can <em>follow</em> direction but needs monitoring and close supervision to do so competently.</p>

<p>A mid-level whatever competently <em>follows</em> direction without monitoring and close supervision.</p>

<p>A senior whatever competently <em>generates</em> direction.</p>

<p>Personally, the fact that I have consistently walked into rooms for 12+ years, taken two sentences of vague bullshit, explored the problem spaces sufficiently to generate large-scale technical direction, and then executed that direction to consistently create tremendous value, that&#39;s what makes me a senior software developer.</p>

<p>But nobody would look at my code and consider me a senior <em>programmer</em>, and even <em>software engineer</em> is a bit of a stretch sometimes.</p>

<p>Many companies, by the way, are resigning themselves to not caring about these distinctions at a macro level.</p>

<p>They simply view all employees who primarily program as &quot;software engineers&quot; or explicitly split the difference with &quot;software development engineers&quot;.  Which is totally okay, it&#39;s just an interesting aspect of the discussion.</p>

<p>One other is that some regions tend to frown on the word &quot;engineer&quot; for people who don&#39;t have engineering degrees and a state-issue d engineering license like civil or mechanical engineers can have.</p>

<p>So sometimes you have software engineers who are called something else out of either regulatory interference or deferrence.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay so what I have to do is save new values into $a0-3 as the arguments and use jal to get them into the recursion? What exactly do I have to do with $ra?

        size++;
    }
    else if (e &lt; (*n)-&gt;data)
        insert(&amp;(*n)-&gt;left,e);

        insert(&amp;(*n)-&gt;right, e);

<p>Also, <code>-&gt;</code> has higher precedence than dereference, so when you recurse, you&#39;ll need to do:</p>

<pre><code>&amp;(*n)-&gt;left
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Another option is to pass <code>n</code> by reference. My personal style, however, is to always pass by pointer rather than by non-const reference, because that way it&#39;s clear that the function may modify the pointee.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You could look into developing an app, in Android and iOS if the one who doesn&#39;t have a Mac has an Android phone. That would also include web development if you had a back-end.</p>

<p>For a different language, look into such as Scala, Clojure, Haskell.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Lol its not. I was in the same mood when i wrote it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes I made a sad face at the lack of an audit option for it as well.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In the end a lot of people will say it doesn&#39;t matter what your title is, as long as you get a paycheck.  However, that kind of view can stifle your growth.  At some point you&#39;re going to be 35 - 45 and if you haven&#39;t had the resume and/or title of what makes a &quot;Senior&quot;, your options are going to be limited in terms of salary.</p>

<p>For the last 15 years I have never had the word &quot;Senior&quot; in my name, and mostly it seems to be about longevity or politics.  Some places absolutely refuse to use it because it implies a raise (mostly smaller companies).</p>

<p>Though I have never had the title, I still demand the salary.  I&#39;m not the cream of the crop, but I&#39;m not a junior developer.</p>

<p>To answer your question, the term Senior really means that you can be left to your own devices and create things.  That doesn&#39;t mean you don&#39;t need guidance on a new language or library and the best practices for those.  It means you&#39;re smart enough to know your limitations and can ask.</p>

<p>That&#39;s my view, but don&#39;t forget, I don&#39;t have never had the words &quot;Senior&quot;, &quot;Lead&quot;, or &quot;Architect&quot; in my name.  Hell, I just assume I&#39;m so badass they want me writing code and that&#39;s why I&#39;m not in management! lol</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I would drop the <code>rankName</code> and <code>suitName</code> fields and put the conversion directly in the <code>getSuitName</code> and <code>getRankName</code> methods.</p>

<p>Further, would I change the <code>if - else</code> chains to <code>switch - case</code> constructs like the following:</p>

<p>Original code:</p>

<pre><code>   final private String toSuitName(int suit) {
        //Gives a string name of each suit.
        if (suit == 1)
            suitName = &quot;Clubs&quot;;
        if (suit == 2)
            suitName = &quot;Diamonds&quot;;
        if (suit == 3)
            suitName = &quot;Hearts&quot;;
        if (suit == 4)
            suitName = &quot;Spades&quot;;
        return suitName;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Modified code:</p>

<pre><code>final private String toSuitName() { // no need to pass a separate
    // variable since the field &quot;suit&quot; is already part of the 
    // class and already filled.

    switch(suit) { 
        case 1:
            suitName = &quot;Clubs&quot;;
            break;
        case 2:
            suitName = &quot;Diamonds&quot;;
            break;
        case 3:
            suitName = &quot;Hearts&quot;;
            break;
        case 4:
            suitName = &quot;Spades&quot;;
            break;
        default:  // actually unnecessary here, but for completeness
            suitName = &quot;&quot;;
            break;
    }
    return suitName;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Or even better, without the <code>suitName</code> field:</p>

<pre><code>public String getSuitName() {
    switch(suit) { 
        case 1:
            return &quot;Clubs&quot;;
        case 2:
            return &quot;Diamonds&quot;;
        case 3:
            return &quot;Hearts&quot;;
        case 4:
            return &quot;Spades&quot;;
    }
    return &quot;&quot;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Other than that, there would be much room of optimization but that would change the whole structure of the code and essentially create a completely different class system. Using <code>Enums</code> for the suits would be a useful improvement.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Were you in a high cost of living with the $60K?  In the Southeast United States, the average starting salary of a developer is about $45 - $55K today.  That&#39;s still about the same as it was when I started adjusting for inflation.</p>

<p>Edit: To give you an idea, I&#39;ve heard that a senior developer in the Southeast can make around $90,000/year on average.  That is equivalent to about $120,000 in Mountain View, CA on cost-of-living alone, but probably more like $150,000 for practical purposes.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for the reply. I am from C programming background and Union/Find implementation is secondary at the moment. I need to know how I should proceed with maintaining pointers and vector. Should I change the topic name?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In general, don&#39;t use C-arrays in C++. Use <code>std::vector</code> if dynamic, and <code>std::array</code> if static. Also, use <code>at()</code>, which is range-checked, unless you are convinced through profiling that it&#39;s a bottle-neck.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I gave it a good read.  But nothing seems to go into the detail of dynamically changing the properties of the solution before runtime.  (aka on creation)</p>
</div><div class="md"><ul>
<li><p>Line 89: I&#39;d use <code>cards</code> instead of <code>deckOfCards</code>.  You have already used that variable name elsewhere.  And next point is related to this:</p></li>
<li><p>Lines 103-104: <code>getDeck()</code> does not return a DeckOfCards object, it returns an array of cards, so I&#39;d name it to reflect that.</p></li>
<li><p><code>toSuitName</code> and <code>toRankName</code> should just be static and they don&#39;t need to assign the class variable since you are doing it the second time when you call those functions on lines 33 and 34</p></li>
<li><p>Those two functions should be implemented using a <code>switch</code> statement or using <code>else if</code>&#39;s instead of just <code>if</code>s</p></li>
<li><p>Again those two functions… since they are trivial, you don&#39;t really need to maintain an integer identifier and a string description for rank and name.  Just have the integer identifier and convert to string when needed.</p></li>

<li><p>Knowledge of debugging / bug fixing.  It baffles me how many people can&#39;t properly use a debugger, set breakpoints, figure out the cause of a bug.</p></li>
<li><p>Not tied to a single methodology, technology, or language.  These are not the people who evangelize.  They understand the advantages and drawbacks of different tools and choose the best one for the job.</p></li>
<li><p>Clear communication of complex ideas.</p></li>

<p>x is a pointer to an integer, but y is an integer value! y is not a pointer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>int* x, y;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the same as the first example. Whitespace here is <strong>not</strong> significant.</p>

<p>Other than that, I&#39;m not sure where your inconsistency lies. Just for clarity, here&#39;s how I would explain it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>int x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is an integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>const int x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is a read-only integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>int* x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is a pointer to integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>int * const x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is a read-only pointer to a writable integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>const int * x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is a writable pointer to a read-only integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>const int * const x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is a read-only pointer to read-only integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>const int * const * const x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>x is a read-only pointer to a read-only pointer to a read-only integer value.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>const int * const * const * const * const * const * const x;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could go as deep as you need. At each location, you can tell the compiler - by using const - whether that location is read-only. This situation, however, requires that your consts and *&#39;s be well-ordered; it&#39;s not modifier soup.</p>

<p>The only place where it doesn&#39;t matter is when you are specifying modifiers for the value. (e.g. choosing between &quot;int const&quot; or &quot;const int&quot;). Both refer to a read-only integer value, so it&#39;s your discretion which form you will use. Other modifiers, like static, can also be reordered in the above manner. However, the placement of * is always significant.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t see how the two are related.  The first example is just a demonstration that whitespace is not significant, whereas the second example is actually reordering things.</p>

<p>The rules for <code>const</code> are very simple — it applies to the thing to its direct left, unless there is no such thing in which case it applies to the thing directly to its right.  So these are both equivalent:</p>

<pre><code>const int *ptr;
int const *ptr;
</code></pre>

<p>Also, you get to choose both the constness of the pointer as well as the constness of the type being pointed to, including the case where they&#39;re both const:</p>

<pre><code>int const * const ptr;
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>Domain knowledge. If you work at Facebook and don&#39;t know graph databases or Google and don&#39;t know search, you&#39;re probably not senior anything. You don&#39;t have to know it at an expert level, but you have to know the business well enough to understand what your project might have to do in the future and what your users will expect from it. Which brings us to...</li>
<li>Workflow expertise. Basically, can you do the job that happens before your team and after your team in a pinch? You just got shitty requirements. Someone has to fix them, and that might mean knowing the right people to ask instead of just filling in details. IT is having trouble with the deployment environment. Someone has to help them. That new project is too small to assign a PM. You&#39;ve got to lead it. The front end guys swear there&#39;s a bug in your back end code. There&#39;s not, but you still have to help them do it right.</li>
<li>Mentorship. You don&#39;t just know other jobs. You know your own job in high enough detail to help other people. You&#39;re also not a <em>complete</em> asshole, so people will accept your help.</li>
<li>Presentable. Your day job isn&#39;t PR, but sometimes you have to represent the team. Can you discuss your workflows, tools, and projects to another dev team? To a non-technical sales team? When Accounting shows up and starts speaking business, do your eyes glaze over? Do we need to send you to the janitor&#39;s supply closet when clients are in town?</li>

<p>You have:</p>

<pre><code>public int getSuit(int suit) {
    return suit;
}

public int getRank(int rank) {
    return rank;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is a mixture of <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> methods.</p>

<p>Since your <code>suit</code> and <code>rank</code> are declared as <code>final</code>, once set, you cannot change the values any more.</p>

<p><strong>Getters</strong> normally don&#39;t have any parameter passed to them:</p>

<pre><code>public int getSuit() {
    return suit;
}

public int getRank() {
    return rank;
}
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Setters</strong> on the other hand, usually have the return type <strong>void</strong> and a parameter passed to them:</p>

<p>(<em>NOTE:</em> the following methods are not applicable for your code as you have <code>suit</code> and <code>rank</code> declared as <code>final</code>.)</p>

<pre><code>public void setSuit(int suit) {
    this.suit = suit;

public void setRank(int rank) {
    this.rank = rank;

</div><div class="md"><p>so, answer_Enter is an event handler. When an &#39;event&#39; happens (in this case, someone pressing a key in a form) this method is fired. The method doesn&#39;t know what type of object has triggered it, so sender is a generic object, therefore you have to cast it as a NumericUpDown to access the methods/variables of a NumericUpDown object. What you&#39;re basically doing is initialising a new NumericUpDown object &#39;answerBox&#39; using sender cast AS NumericUpDown.</p>

<p>The if statement simply says &quot;if answerBox exists&quot; i.e. is not null.</p>

<p>You will get an error here if a different kind of object calls answer_Enter as you might not be able to cast it as a NumericUpDown, but it should be fine for what you&#39;re doing!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>20+ year programmer here.  The HONEST answer is that I&#39;m &quot;senior&quot; because I&#39;ve been coding for longer than 3 years, and the salary requirement that I give to recruiters is six digits.  In the marketplace, that&#39;s all &quot;senior&quot; really means today.  Sadly, I&#39;m not joking.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ll try to answer the genuine question that I believe you&#39;re asking.  </p>

<p>When I was &quot;junior&quot;, I was almost completely useless.  I felt betrayed because I did not see how anything I did in college actually applied to real-world work, and I lived in constant terror that my bosses would figure out that I was a fraud.</p>

<p>About 3-5 years into my professional life, I became what I think of as &quot;mid-level&quot;.  At this point I had an epiphany.  I hadn&#39;t been a fraud, virtually no one else fresh out of school knew what they were doing either!  That&#39;s why salaries were only $60k.  I thought I was rich at the time (I come from a working-class background)... but now in the mid-level stage I was making $90k, and realizing that in a few more years I&#39;d be well into six figures, and starting to understand that this is just the scale of things in the field.  My first bosses had been perfectly aware of how little I had been able to contribute early on.</p>

<p>Up through this point, I had been DEVOURING books, documentation, and online tutorials.  Not only about various programming languages and frameworks... but also about design patterns, architectural principals, project management methodologies, and general knowledge relevant to the craft of software development in the real world.  I was a sponge, and starting to know quite a lot.  </p>

<p>Therefore, I like to think of the &quot;mid-level&quot; career stage as also being the &quot;sophomore&quot; level.  You&#39;ve learned a ton, and are no longer the terrified freshman that you recently were.  However, you don&#39;t yet have much experience or mastery over any of this theoretical book knowledge that you&#39;ve been absorbing, either.  Here&#39;s the crucial problem: you aren&#39;t yet fully AWARE that reading a book doesn&#39;t make you a master of its domain.</p>

<p>So the mid-level/sophomore stage can be summed up as &quot;knowing just enough to be dangerous&quot;.  In the process of trying out new knowledge, I was constantly over-engineering code, and lobbying for the use of languages and frameworks for little practical purpose.  It was at this stage of my career that I liked to create source files like <code>AbstractFactoryFacadeSingletonCommandPatternDelegateVisitor.java</code>.  It was at this stage of my career that I badgered my bosses about re-writing the entire flagship application in Scala, just because.</p>

<p>To answer your question.. now that I consider myself &quot;senior&quot;, the difference is that I&#39;ve accumulated real-world experience with all of that theory that I absorbed in my &quot;mid-level&quot; stage.  I&#39;m less inclined to take dogma at absolute face value, and more understanding of the fact that principles for architecting huge systems aren&#39;t necessarily applicable for designing small systems.  I&#39;ve learned the contours of several languages, so I can more judiciously recommend their use (e.g. Scala is fantastic for highly-concurrent libraries or microservices, which will be maintained by only a small number of experts, but the learning curve is too high and the market talent pool too shallow to make it good for general application development).</p>

<p><strong>In short, when I was &quot;mid-level&quot; I always tried to over-complicate things in order to prove how smart I was.  I see &quot;senior&quot; as keeping things as simple as possible, because you DON&#39;T have anything to prove.  However, the level of book-knowledge really isn&#39;t all that different.</strong></p>

<p>One final point, just to be honest.  You always have to continue learning in this field, you can&#39;t sit still and become stagnant.  So while I consider myself &quot;senior&quot; in the areas in which I&#39;m &quot;senior&quot;, I too can still be &quot;mid-level&quot; in new things as I learn them.  It&#39;s a lifelong cycle!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>These are simple, yet fundamental, concepts. In this context, I would imagine that in-depth knowledge is not expected. </p>

<p>Try following introductory series&#39; to PHP and MySQL. PHP is very easy to get into and will cover essential topics such as variables, loops, statements, etc. early on. MySQL - which is 95% the same as SQL, which is what the C# course will probably use - is for querying the database. This would also introduce database concepts such as normalisation, protection, relationships, keys, data types, etc. </p>

<p>Neither are ideal, but its where most applicants are at. If you can set up a small localhost project with a php / mysql script to query a DB and manipulate the results, I&#39;d say you&#39;d be fine. Note also that program flows and much of database concepts are largely theory based - swotting up on wikipedia is as good as anything for these.</p>

<p>You can always just audit the course - if you feel lost, just drop out, prep accordingly, and try again.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>D&#39;oh. Thank you.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, so it sounds like you haven&#39;t had a challenging programming problem till now. Many lower-level undergrad courses will do a fair bit of hand-holding. You already know what to do (like implement a hash table), it&#39;s just a matter of doing it. I wouldn&#39;t worry about it too much. Just realize that you have a bit more of a ways to go before you are ready for the real world.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It looks like you have a couple bugs. This is not a problem, and please forgive me if I come across as too direct. Without further ado:</p>

<p>First, it&#39;s helpful to mention the errors you get when you&#39;re posting, as it may not be obvious what is wrong with your program. I compiled it myself and got these:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>SingleCard.java:9: error: cannot assign a value to final variable rank<br/>
   this.rank = rank;<br/>
       ^<br/>
SingleCard.java:10: error: cannot assign a value to final variable suit<br/>
   this.suit = suit;         </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This problem comes down to &quot;public void SingleCard&quot; not actually being a constructor; it&#39;s a method that&#39;s named the same as the class! The compiler doesn&#39;t care about this, though, and thinks your program is trying to assign a final variable in some method named &quot;SingleCard&quot;, and it&#39;s complaining that it can&#39;t do that.</p>

<p>Finally, I will mention that the methods like getRank and getSuit are surely declared incorrectly. These methods would be expected to return <strong>that object&#39;s</strong> value. Your program has them returning the value that is being passed in; in other words, the object&#39;s value is never used.</p>

<p>Perhaps your thinking is that you must declare all variables before using them? That is true for local variables, but these are object variables, so they are already declared and accessible for all methods in the class. My basic rule is this: If you can refer to &quot;this&quot; , you can also refer to this object&#39;s variables. The exceptions occur when variables use the same name; in those cases, the compiler must make a best-effort guess as to which one you mean.</p>

<p>P.S. For the curious, here&#39;s the Java&#39;s specification on final variables: <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.4">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-4.html#jls-4.12.4</a></p>

</div><div class="md"><p>When declaring a constructor, <strong>don&#39;t</strong> put a <strong>return type</strong>.</p>

<p>Constructors <strong>never</strong> have a return type.</p>

<p>Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>public void SingleCard(int rank, int suit) {
</code></pre>

<p>use:</p>

<pre><code>public SingleCard(int rank, int suit) {

<p>to create a <em>proper</em> constructor.</p>

</div><div class="md"><pre><code>for words in (words):
</code></pre>

<p>That line takes each element from the list <code>words</code>, one at a time, calls the current element <code>words</code> (not a good name under the circumstances), and does the stuff after the colon for each element.</p>

<p>Since the stuff after the colon returns the element if it is a palindrome, well, it returns that word if it is a palindrome. There is no returning of a list, no creating of a list, and indeed no checking the rest of the <code>words</code> list for more palindromes since you return when you find the first one.</p>

<p>If you want to return a list of palindromes, you have to create such a list, then return it when you&#39;re done creating it.</p>

<p>For starters, to avoid naming the word currently being tested the same as the list of words, and also to give it a more fitting name, I would suggest you call that variable <code>word</code>, singular. Then I would suggest you begin with an empty list that you can name <code>palindromes</code>, and then add palindromes to that list.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I mean &quot;I will&quot;</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Additionally you said you want to return a list of palindromes. Look at where your return statement is and see if it makes sense to have it there. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Honestly, you don&#39;t need more schooling, you need to write more code. Engineering is not some mystery field that can only be explained through higher-learning. The best engineers I know have not gone to college. They just write insane amounts of code. For these people, the first solution to any problem is to think of a way to write code to make it happen.</p>

<p>There are a billion places to learn how to program on the internet. Pick a functional area that interests you (iOS/Android, Web Development, Games) and dive in. There are no shortcuts to becoming a great programmer. You have to write code.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The best way here is to use list comprehensions or filter</p>

<p>In your code, you find the first palindrome and return it(instead of returning all palindromes). </p>

<p>Also, it is not a good idea to give for-loop variable the exact same name as the list(for words in (words):)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yea, I always just audit. It&#39;s exactly the same anyway, you just don&#39;t get a special certificate.</p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>for words in (words):

<p>That is a bad name for your element variable because it creates confusion between the individual elements and the collection, so when you return words, what do you think that words actually reefers too?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As <a href="/u/i8beef">/u/i8beef</a> mentioned, a large portion of senior programming responsibilities revolve around soft-skills.</p>

<p>Every engineer on my team can write excellent code. They are engineers and that is what we pay them to do. But only a few of us are capable of engaging with the customer, gathering requirements, and then translating those requirements into a project plan, project schedule, workflow breakdowns, and have enough experience over a wide range of technology stacks to pick the right tool for the job.</p>

<p>We are a game development/training company, so almost all of our projects call for a different technology stack depending on the customer&#39;s needs. One project may use Unity3d, another may call for Flash, sometimes we fall back on something like Captivate or even doing something in iOS or Android.</p>

<p>Being a Senior means that you&#39;ve done enough things in your career to be able to make informed choices based on past experience. </p>

<p>One of the things that I like to do with my engineers is to have them attend the customer/stakeholder meetings with me. I usually have them take notes and ask questions, but what I&#39;m really hoping is that they&#39;re going to learn how to deal with the customer. How their role in a meeting as engineer is to ask as many questions as they can so that they&#39;re able to inform the team.</p>

<p>I also like to give them random programming tasks and little one-off projects (tooling, internal prototypes, etc) to give them experience with different frameworks and technologies.</p>

<p>OP sounds like he&#39;s fairly inexperience (just my assumption!), and if he&#39;s worrying about making errors like missing semi-colons from the end of lines like he states, then an IDE is going to help him with that, no?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, what I try to do is think exactly what methods I&#39;ll use and how I&#39;ll create my classes and if any pattern will apply. I guess not everybody should do that but it works fine for me.</p>

<p>A good interviewer will raise questions about bugs that they notice in hopes that you&#39;ll realize for yourself that there&#39;s a bug. Walk through your code and explain what the values of variables will be at each point to help find bugs here.</p>

<p>Most minor syntax errors will be ignored in whiteboard programming. These problems are focused towards problem solving and it&#39;s implied that you&#39;ll be able to figure out things like missing semicolons when you compile.</p>

<p>You and the interviewer should be agreeing on a language before hand. If it&#39;s pseudocode, requirements are lax, so you wouldn&#39;t have to worry about things like data types there. In fact, pseudocode almost never mentions primitive types, as they can be determined from context.</p>

<p>I have been using Udacity, and they&#39;re great for a very basic intro which is fine for me.  I just need something to get started.  I was looking to look at AngularJS and Node.js, but couldn&#39;t find any sites that had free courses.</p>

<pre><code>while !endOfQueue

<p>The while loop doesn&#39;t make sense unless you intend to make each search multiple times or something. You need to break out of the loop if the time has been exceeded.</p>

<p>Note that this only allows exiting at the beginning of the loop. So it can actually take more then 3 minutes. Eg, if we&#39;re at 2:59 and just starting the loop, we won&#39;t break. If the search takes 15 seconds, we&#39;d end up stopping after approximately 3:14. If you need more precise stopping, you could either check the time more frequently (which will slightly slow you down) or make the method asynchronous and choose to ignore the results from it if it takes too long (not the most efficient choice, but can get close timing).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The others have already mentioned <code>scanf()</code>, <code>fgets()</code>, etc. I&#39;d just like to point out two terminology mistakes in your post:</p>

<ol>
<li>&quot;output&quot; is not the same thing as &quot;input&quot;.</li>
<li>The command line is the line of text the user typed to command the shell to start your program, and which is passed to <code>main()</code> in the <code>argv</code> parameter. That&#39;s not where you are looking to read your input. The word you are looking for is either &quot;keyboard&quot;, &quot;terminal&quot;, or &quot;stdin&quot;.</li>
</ol>
</div><div class="md"><p>As an aside, it&#39;s <em>input</em> in this case.</p>

<p>Input = Getting data from something (the console, a file, etc)<br/>
Output = Sending data to something</p>

<p>In particular, there&#39;s standard input and output, which defaults to the console and is <em>the</em> way to read/write from the console. It can be redirected at the shell level to read/write to a file instead.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Strings in C are just arrays of characters. Here&#39;s some basic input / output.</p>

<hr/>

<pre><code>#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    char buffer[500];        /* String of length 500 */

    fgets(buffer, 500, stdin);    /* Grab 500 characters MAX from the commandline, return at Enter (newline, \n), and put in buffer string */

<hr/>

<p><strong>Things to note with Strings in C</strong></p>

<p>There is a string library: &lt;string.h&gt; that has a few useful functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>strlen(string) - returns the length of a string. buffer[500] may only return 10, if there are 10 characters in it.</p></li>
<li><p>strcpy(destination, source) - copies contents of a string to another</p></li>
<li><p>strcmp(string1, string2) - compares 2 strings for similarities, returns 0 on equal, 1 on string1 &gt; string2, and -1 on string1 &lt; string2</p></li>
<li><p>strcat(string1, string2) - copies string2 to concatenation onto the end of string1, make sure that string1 has the space to hold it though!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Also, C strings are as follows:</p>

<p>You take an array of characters (buffer[10]):</p>

<p>buffer [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]</p>

<p>and you have to have a null terminator &#39;\0&#39; or a 0, at the end of a string. As in C, unless you specify all elements to be 0, you can have garbage values at the end:</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<p>strcpy(buffer, &quot;cat&quot;);    /* Copy the word cat into our buffer */</p>

<pre><code>      0   1   2  3   4  5   6   7   8  9     (0-9, or 10 elements)
</code></pre>

<p>buffer [c] [a] [t] [\0] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?] [?]</p>

<ul>
<li>What&#39;s an easy to to make sure we don&#39;t have garbage values?</li>
</ul>

<p>buffer[100] = {0};</p>

<p>This will make a string of length 100 (0-99 elements) and set every value to 0.</p>

<p>Make sure to always null terminate the end of a string if you&#39;re manipulating it NOT using a string.h function.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I hear you man. I recently had a pretty bad week, slacked a bit too much on 2 things, but I think they&#39;ll work out.</p>

<p>Just remember that things always do work out, even if you have to live in the trenches for a few months. If you can get to 3rd year, even if it takes you an extra semester or two, there&#39;s literally no reason you can&#39;t get your BA. You&#39;re obviously smart enough to be where you are, and I&#39;m sure lots of people have given up and dropped out of your field. Asking for help is literally what programmers do. You may think you can&#39;t get assignments done without your friends, but replace friends with google / stack overflow / professor / TA. Everyone needs help to get things done. You may think they&#39;re your crutch, but I&#39;m sure you are smart enough / can think critically enough to put in work yourself.</p>

<p>Just remember to cut down on games / tv shows / movies and try to get an extra few hours of work done on your off days, that way you won&#39;t feel as overwhelmed when things are due.</p>

<p>If you need to chat ever, feel free to message me. There are lots of subreddits that help ease stress. I&#39;ve found dropping sugar, and sodium heavy foods, working out helps a lot. Also, picking up a new TV show and watching an episode every meal helps a lot, it gets your mind off things.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you&#39;re really worried about your code, send me a link to your github or some code you&#39;ve done (I specialize in C, Java, Ada, Fortran, COBOL, but I have experience with others [python, HTML PHP, JS.... etc.]). I can tell you if it&#39;s similar to where you should be, as I&#39;m around where you are in school right now.</p>

<p>I have rough days weekly, but same as you, just keep your head up, cut bad habits, make good ones, relax every few hours of work and it will get better!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Me 2 :-D! </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Maybe grab some solid libraries and use something like windows c ... ? SDL for graphics </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I slacked my way through first year. The low-level concepts were so piss easy that I never paid attention in class and did assignments literally the day they were due (unless it was one of the major projects.... I pulled all nighters on those the night before), and probably developed very bad, lazy habbits from that. I helped people who were absolutely clueless (hadn&#39;t done coding in high school like I had), and now I feel like one of them.</p>

<p>I have vague ideas of what to do, but I feel like I&#39;ve been thrown into the deep end. I&#39;m doing AI this semester, I&#39;ve been waiting all my university life to get to do this paper, and now I just feel so overwhelmed that I feel like it&#39;s going to be a lot of stressed out sleepless nights.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I did it intentionally</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/">http://learnpythonthehardway.org/</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re mostly right. If anyone using <em>java</em> of all things is trying to <em>optimize</em> I think they need to rethink there language choice.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Do you mean by taking the &#39;audit&#39; route? Else its $90 for me</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There sure is a lot of FUD in this thread. Just download Google Chrome if you&#39;re worried about malware. Install the tools you need from <a href="https://ninite.com/">https://ninite.com/</a>.</p>

<p>Get a text editor (Notepad++ is good for Windows), pick one language (e.g., python), and go for it.</p>

<p>If you try to install a Linux distro on older hardware, there&#39;s always a chance that you&#39;re going to run into problems. If you can spare $5 / month, you&#39;re better off setting up a Digital Ocean VPS (it&#39;s a good learning experience), get PuTTY from Ninite, and use Linux remotely.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As a plan of action, this sounds a lot like dikjtras algorithm and using trees / graphs (a 2 second year concept.) I googled quickly and came up with an explanation of bi-directional search and how it&#39;s related to what I thought.</p>

<p>Overall if you have literally no idea what to do, then it&#39;s probably because you slacked a bit in a few classes. If you&#39;re relying on friends, but getting the work done with high marks, there&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with that. My friends all help each other if we have questions to get a final project done quicker. Without friends, projects are doable, but maybe an extra 10-20 hours. </p>

<p>I think as long as you&#39;re doing the projects, you&#39;re fine. School is stressful and you&#39;re having maybe a bad semester, but everything always works out in the end my friend, keep working hard and take a few fun courses next semester to cleanse your palate and bit.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Right now, out there in the big world there are quite a bit more back end systems in PHP then there are in Python. I know I have worked on a few.<br/>
This is because PHP used to be a massively popular language for backend web development not too long ago. So yes, many people need PHP. And Java for the same reason.</p>

<p>It is however my opinion that we would be best served by ultimately exchanging all those PHP back end systems with the same systems only made in Python.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I will definitely do that</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>And before RCS there was SCCS, which goes back even further. According to Wikipedia the first release was in 1972.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It would be quite useful if someone could write some lines about each course.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;d do then: just get Apache and PHP set up with a basic request.php file. All the file needs to contain is:</p>

<p><code>&lt;?php echo &quot;Hello world!&quot;;</code></p>

<p>That&#39;s it. Make sure when you browse to http://localhost/request.php  (or localhost:8888 depending on your config) the page displays <code>Hello world!</code>.</p>

<p>Now, beg/borrow/steal/google your way to setting up a simple index.html file with some JavaScript, AJAX, jQuery, whatever, that will query <code>http://localhost/request.php</code> (or localhost:8888)  and display the result with a <code>console.log(result)</code>. You can google for how to bring up the JavaScript console in your browser.</p>

<p>ie: navigating to http://localhost/index.html will show the &#39;Hello world&#39; that your request.php file is echoing.</p>

<p>This shouldn&#39;t take more than 15 lines of code between the HTML and the JavaScript. If things seem more complicated than they should then you&#39;re off track.</p>

<p>Even though you&#39;re using PHP, the HTML/JavaScript end of things is entirely independent of that. The query could be coming from anywhere or anything as far as JavaScript is concerned.</p>

<p>Once you are at that point then you&#39;re ready to decide if you want to learn more JavaScript, more PHP, another back-end language entirely, or even something completely different.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Technical interviewer here - minor bugs are not really a problem for me. I&#39;m not looking for perfect code - I&#39;ve coded for 25+ years and understand that there&#39;s pretty much no such thing as &#39;bug free code&#39;, certainly in the first iteration.</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking more for your approach in solving problems - ie, if I ask you to generate the fibonacci sequence to 20 places, I want to see you trying to use recursion. Major errors in logic and approach are going to work against your rather than code not compiling in the first instance.</p>

<p>Also, consider trying test driven development. If a candidate starts off by writing a test, then they&#39;re miles ahead of my other candidates in my eyes. They&#39;d get extra points for writing their tests, writing their code, seeing their code break a test and then fixing the code.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m looking for general coding style - how you name variables and methods, do you apply good OOP/D principles, etc.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not looking for people who can produce perfect code on the first attempt, we want people who can solve problems and know the best approaches.</p>

<p>Also, where possible, try and use an IDE. That&#39;ll catch the majority of syntax errors. We provide candidates with an Eclipse setup (just because the majority of our guys use Eclipse), but I&#39;m happy for them to setup their preferred IDE in advance. If a candidate comes to an interview and defaults to a text editor and command line, then I&#39;m instantly worried!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Version control has been around a long time; RCS was invented in 1982, and CVS appeared in 1986.  These are not new concepts, although the idea of <em>distributed</em> version control is relatively new.</p>

<p>And internet access is not a prerequisite for collaboration.  Back in the 80s or 90s people had modems and we dialed bulletin board systems (BBSes) where you could post messages to other users of the area.  You could post patches that way.  And of course for the people that did have access to email or Usenet through their employer or whatnot, there was lots of activity in collaborative development there.

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m doing C#!!!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Almost all languages have things that work like pointers.  For example, reference types in Java and C# and so on are really just pointers.  The de-referencing is done for you automatically, and there&#39;s no pointer arithmetic allowed, but it&#39;s still fundamentally a pointer.  And in Python, there isn&#39;t even the option of using anything but pointers; there aren&#39;t primitive types.</p>

<p>In languages where the lifetime of objects are managed by the runtime (e.g. through garbage collection) it&#39;s important that the runtime be able to find all pointers/references that exist in the program, so that it can tell when an object no longer is referenced.  If pointers worked like they do in C, it would be possible to do things like e.g. store a pointer value in an integer, hiding it from the runtime.  That would lead to crashes, because you&#39;d be able to attempt to access an object whose lifetime has already ended.  Languages that aren&#39;t C or C++ are big on safety, in that nothing you can write as a program should be able to cause a crash; it can cause an exception, but that&#39;s not the same thing.  So for this reason, access to raw pointers is not allowed, but the fundamental idea of a pointer (i.e. something that refers to some object) still exists.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Installing operating systems on laptops and desktops aren&#39;t like flashing ROMs on phones or tablets. There is no bricking as you aren&#39;t messing with a boot loader or anything like that, even if you screw up the install you are still left with the BIOS and so can try again.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Keep your ears and eyes open at all times, carry a notebook if you have to. Take down everything new you see or learn in that book (or in your head). Recall, recollect and practice. Use your own computer to test new concepts you&#39;ve learned and read up on the basic crux of what you&#39;ll be doing, online (Wikipedia?)</p>

<p>Don&#39;t read up too much and try to seem like a smart-ass on the first day. Nobody likes that and chances are, your cockiness will cloud your judgement and you&#39;ll end up saying something wrong and look like a fool. Just get the basics right. Frequently used terms, how different things work, etc. Get your peers to like you, but don&#39;t try too hard. You should be fine.</p>

<p>You&#39;re right in assuming that, since you&#39;re a freshman, the company won&#39;t expect too much from you. That&#39;s why they&#39;re probably giving you a vast variety of roles, so that you can figure out what field works best for you and stick with that. Try and experiment with every field until you find one that really clicks. Speak to someone and say you want to go fulltime on that. </p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the thing I don&#39;t get.   I use C++, C# and JavaScript, but right now I&#39;m focusing on C++.   What I don&#39;t get is that in order for me to call a method in isolation, that means that anything that method calls outside the class, or within the class that is slow, should call a test-double.   In order for that to work, there has to be a level of indirection.   This means I have to make the methods abstract and have an interface.   Or I have to use function pointers that can be modified.   Is that not true?   So in order for me to make my code testable, I have to use virtual functions unnecessarily.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason that C++ allows class methods to not be virtual unless required.   Because why take the overhead of a function call indirection in those cases when performance is paramount.</p>

<p>So you have to argue that that particular design criteria of C++ is not compatible with writing isolated unit tests.</p>

<p>unless, somehow some tricks are played with macros, or a different implementation is injected by binding to a different library statically, or including a different header file under test.</p>

<p>So that&#39;s great for C++, but not so much for C#.</p>

<p>It just seems to me that one of the design goals of static functions or non-virtual member functions, which is direct, non-virtual, function call for the sake of performance is incompatible with the philosophy of isolated unit tests.</p>

<p>My guess is that you have incremented a pointer in order to point to the next element in an array, and not taken care to increment it by the actual size of one element in the array: four. It is not sufficient to increment the pointer by 1, as the resulting pointer will then point one byte into the four bytes belonging to the first element, and not to the first byte of the next element. That&#39;s just my guess, but somehow a pointer has gotten misaligned anyway.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Well, for one thing:</p>

<pre><code>blt $a1, $t2, quicksort # (left &lt; j)
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s not recursion, that&#39;s a loop. A subroutine call is done with <code>jal</code>, like you have in <code>main</code> on line 14.</p>

<p>The difference is that with a jump, like in a loop, you just jump to another location and keep running from there; while with a subroutine call, you jump <em>and also remember where you jumped *</em>from***, so that you can return to there later. <code>jal</code> jumps and puts the return address in <code>$ra</code>, and the subroutine returns by doing a <code>jr $ra</code>, like you have at the end of your <code>quicksort</code> routine.</p>

<p>But if the <em>called</em> routine then <em>also</em> needs to call a subroutine (itself recursively or any other routine), it needs to save the current value of <code>$ra</code> on the stack before the call, make the call, and then restore <code>$ra</code> after the call returns, since the call will overwrite the value in <code>$ra</code>. Are you following?</p>

<p>Also, <code>quicksort</code> takes its parameters in <code>$a0</code>, <code>$a1</code>, <code>$a2</code>, and <code>$a3</code>, but I don&#39;t see that you put any new values in those registers when you call <code>quicksort</code> recursively? So then you are calling it again with the same parameters, so it&#39;s not so surprising that the values &quot;reinitialise&quot;.</p>

<p>The distinction I was drawing was that OSX is a unix based system, because there are many unix based systems. Really no point in arguing. The actual point I was making is that GP said that OSX is a linux distro, which is just not true.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>but instead of specifying the number of characters in the array they used the int loop correct?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think what you are asking is: instead of using an integer literal, they used a variable (loop) that is an integer. Sure. When indexing an array, the subscript needs to be an expression that evaluates to an integral value. So, for example:</p>

<pre><code>int main(void) {

    int arr[10];
    unsigned char i = 5;
    arr[i]; // Ok
    arr[1 + 2 + 3]; // OK

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And this code is OK. As long as the subscript expression gives an integral value, you are OK.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And because &#39;loop&#39; is in fact a loop</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what you mean by this. The name of the variable has no effect on the code. Just because you named a variable <code>loop</code> doesn&#39;t mean that your code behaves differently.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when it is specified</p>

<p>the following &#39;if&#39; functions check</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This also doesn&#39;t make sense. YOu have checks for uppercase, numeric, etc. because there is code for that. Lines 11 - 16 are there in your code, and they will be executed. THat&#39;s all there is to it.</p>

<p>Every language implies an abstract &quot;machine&quot;, and becoming proficient in that language requires developing a mental model of that abstract machine.

</div><div class="md"><p>So I got a C in my first programming course. I dropped out of school 2 years after that after failing a lot more things. Then randomly picked up web development during one of my jobs and fell in love with programming. Now I&#39;m going to school for it and doing pretty well. But programming isn&#39;t about school or grades, its more than that, its a hobby its what you do in your down time. Its what you want to talk about with to your friends. Its projects you want to do to put on your github account. </p>

<p>Op, if you really want to do programming, you should get out into the industry, go to meetup see what people are saying and reevaluate if this is what you want to do . If it is, then building that network will be how you will be motivated to get back on that horse. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think it helps to define what you mean by Object-Oriented Programming. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2yyj3l/best_way_to_learn_oop/cpe57cd">reply/thread by reboticon</a> here brings up Python, which illustrates my point: object-oriented programming is not necessarily Object-Oriented Programming with capital letters.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been something like 40 years and OOP (capitals!) doesn&#39;t have a standard definition. Different languages and organizations define OOP differently and utilize different aspects of the paradigm. The OP listed a bunch of vocabulary terms -- Wikipedia has nice explanations or you can search any term and find hundreds of articles. The important thing is to learn that OOP is one of many paradigms, to apply &quot;proper&quot; OOP in a language that supports it (Java, C++, etc) by following the popular or accepted language guides, then moving on to doing useful things with that knowledge in your head.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue far too many CS courses spend time focusing on OOP (via Java, specifically) because they want to churn out people to get employed to work on &#39;Enterprise Software&#39; at big companies; the point of the paradigm and when/how to use it gets lost in the &#39;Do it this way because XYZ Inc will want you to&#39; manner of teaching. Outside of BBSs and Comp Sci courses I feel like I&#39;ve rarely spent any time talking about OOP and whether we&#39;re properly using [language-buzzword-here], we&#39;re talking about whether the separation of concerns we&#39;re discussing makes sense and is secure/performant/simple-to-understand/logical-to-use.</p>

<p>IME weak programmers hide behind paradigm conventions (You didn&#39;t define a proper getter/setter in this class, it&#39;s mixed up in [x] method!) while everyone else tries to figure out why they care. Java is (was?) particularly bad, since the language forced OOP-<em>style</em> code but has (had?) no way to enforce real OOP-conventions. Lots of OOP I&#39;ve seen would be better defined as messy procedural code with classes.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The simple answer? Quit using D3.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got lots of reasons for this if you&#39;d like to hear them, but I&#39;m not going to reply with a rant. You want to know Javascript, right? Learn Javascript. As-is you&#39;re applying iffy JS and misusing a visualization library.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be a downer, but almost everything you&#39;ve written needs some work. The HTML/CSS has several small errors that will continue to break your desired behavior no matter how you change the JS.</p>

<p>I&#39;d also suggest rethinking your approach to the problem, though I suspect you&#39;ve been led down a strange path by trying to apply SVG/D3 where it doesn&#39;t belong.</p>

<p>Try this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Make a page with ONE div and the court image in the background</li>
<li>Write some Javascript to make a circle appear where you click in the DIV. (focus on the positioning first, then the circle) You can make a circle shape with only CSS</li>
<li>Add a counter inside the circle</li>
</ol>

<p>From there you can start adding fancier features and tweaking behavior for your intended app. Key words you&#39;ll need to research are &#39;event listeners&#39; and &#39;CSS positioning.&#39; How you handle creating elements (the circles) inside the container DIV (with the background image) will change how you handle mouse clicks (the events you&#39;re listening for).</p>

<p>Hope that helps, I&#39;m trying to be kinda vague instead of giving you code!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here is a paste of a program I wrote a long time ago that might give you some insight, it validates and returns the type of a triangle (sans user input): <strong><a href="http://codepad.org/XkyapvZC">triangle.c</a></strong></p>

Drivers could be incompatible, or would need non-trivial (for a beginner) tweaks to set up. Many people told me not to set it up as a primary operating system.</p>

<p>A lot of programmers take for granted how much information they know compared to a beginner. I am relatively tech savvy and use Ubuntu on my server. I was aprehensive about loading on my laptop. Now I have mac so it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense to set up now.</p>

<p>Not necessarily true. It really depends on what columns are indexed. This is a pretty standard relational problem, which is exactly what relational databases are good at. </p>

<p>One trap people fall into with SQL is they approach it with a procedural (or OO) mindset. That&#39;s wrong, and leads to people making complex or inefficient queries because they&#39;re trying to &quot;optimize&quot;. Or even worse, they pull large datasets into the app and manipulate it there because they think they know better than the database engine.</p>

<p>Writing good SQL is all about understanding how to communicate what you want relationally. That&#39;s all a SQL query is: a declaration of what you want the database to spit out. You don&#39;t tell it HOW to give you the answer. It figures that out itself. (Which is pretty amazing when you think about it)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>So you make sure only positive nonzero edge lengths are passed to the program, the first case I gave still breaks the program in the sense that it does not correctly identify what type of triangle it is (assuming we stick with checking equality of edge lengths).    </p>

<p>If this is a basic programming class, then we can look over what kind of data is passed to to program. This particular problem was introduced to me to illustrate how important and difficult it can be to make your program work correctly with human input. It is worth noting the problem stated by OP is to design a program that goes from input to an answer, in which case checking for cases such as sides with length 0 is important, yet no one has said anything about this or the myriad of other cases which crop up.</p>

<pre><code> ==16641== Source and destination overlap in strncpy(0xBEFFF558, 0xBEFFF568, 51)

</blockquote>

<p>What is line 411 of prog7.c?  It appears to be something like</p>

<pre><code>strncpy(buf, buf + 16, 51);
</code></pre>

<p>Just like the error says, it&#39;s illegal according to the standard for any part of the source and destination to overlap.  This is the case for both <code>strcpy()</code> and <code>strncpy()</code>, so I doubt that you actually fixed anything, you just got lucky.  What exactly are you trying to do here — remove the first 16 chars of a string?  If the source and destination ranges overlap you must use <code>memmove()</code>, which requires specifying the length of the region to be copied explicitly rather than stopping at a nul character.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What seems important, won&#39;t last forever.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yup, I was supplying a pointer to an array, when I needed to be supplying the buffer array itself. All the variables were lined up, I just blanked and treated byte[] like an int.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, I see. Probably the computer would smoke and catch fire.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Two neat python things:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.transitions = {}

def increment(self, ch):
    if ch in self.transitions:
        self.transitions[ch] += 1
    else:
        self.transitions[ch] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>So, you noticed that if the key you&#39;re trying to enter isn&#39;t already in your dictionary you have to write special-case code for it.  Wouldn&#39;t it be nice if you could just set a default for the value of not-yet-present dictionary keys?  You can!</p>

<p>Enter <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.defaultdict">defaultdict</a>.  With it, you could write this:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.transitions = collections.defaultdict(int)

def increment(self, ch):
    self.transitions[ch] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>How defaultdict works is that, when you first access a key that isn&#39;t already in the dictionary, it&#39;ll call the function you gave it (in the case above, the built-in function <code>int</code>) and whatever value that function returns is the value that&#39;s put in the dictionary.  Since <code>int()</code> returns 0, <code>defaultdict(int)</code> is the perfect way to do counters.</p>

<p>Or it would be, if it weren&#39;t so common that there&#39;s already a <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/collections.html#collections.Counter">Counter</a> class built in!  Counter works just like <code>defaultdict(int)</code> does but also has some added functionality that&#39;s useful for counting things.  With it, your code would look like:</p>

<pre><code>def __init__(self):
    self.transitions = collections.Counter()

def increment(self, ch):
    self.transitions[ch] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>But if you want to find work easier-- learn PHP (#4b) or Java (#4a)-- after javascript (#3) Assuming you are okay with HTML &amp; CSS, those are #1 &amp; #2 respectively. Python may be a better language, but people want PHP &amp; Java skilled people. The people that want python people want other skills in addition. You asking this question probably means you don&#39;t have those skills.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure of the details of the language, but if you treated the input as a string and broke it up, then converted it into an int, that could work? </p>

<p>Thanks for offering your perspective on things. I honestly might make more of an effort to go to class now.

</div><div class="md"><p>Play with writing bash code on a server (Unix) by getting access to one via school. Or better yet buy a raspberry pi and learn that way.

<p>For a language like Java it kinda makes sense to use an IDE pretty early on just because of how verbose it is, but I still think you should at <em>least</em> use a text editor and get used to the way the compiler works for a bit before you switch to an IDE.</p>

<p>For languages like Python, Ruby, Javascript, PHP, etc. I think it&#39;s best to stick with just a text editor until you are comfortable with the language.</p>

<p>The only thing I do is study a lot, try to not underestimate things and learn from projects I&#39;ve been into.</p>

<p>One thing I think makes the difference is I try to find the cause of every problem I see, and a lot of developers I know just fix things without really knowing what happened.</p>

<p>My tips are: plan ahead, don&#39;t start coding until you know exactly what you&#39;ll do.</p>

<p>Avoid trial and error. I often see people changing random things and seeing if that works. If you do that, you won&#39;t learn where the code failed nor why.</p>

<p>Being technically a good programmer is great but what makes you awesome is being a good problem solver. I&#39;ve met people who are great technically but fail to deliver solutions because they don&#39;t actually solve the user&#39;s requirements.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s more a personal preference than anything else. If you were to use vim and have never used it, then trying to use it while trying to meet your project deadlines would be a recipe for disaster. If you do not have strict deadlines, then vim is a great choice in coding tools. I have been using vim for the last 10 years but it took me about a year to get actually comfortable in it. Its versatility, speed and extensions (including macros etc) make it an ideal choice for some of my projects, but if I am working on a Java / JEE project for example, I tend to use a good ide like IDEA as I can do a lot that is specific to the frameworks &amp; language I am using.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hm, I see what you mean. I guess what I meant was that your grade can depends on things that aren&#39;t necessarily related to how well you know the material. The most readily available example of this is the, in my opinion, ridiculous amount of senior level classes that have attendance as a non-trivial component of your grade. </p>

<p>I just can&#39;t see why where my body is should have a reflection on my grade. Not going to class has it&#39;s own consequences such as not being there for in-class examples and lecture notes and talking points that aren&#39;t on posted notes. It feels like them giving you a cookie for being a good boy and following directions (being in class) and swatting your hand with a ruler for daring to break tradition. </p>

<p>Additionally, my direct supervisor, the Intro to Programming professor at [on second thought, I probably shouldn&#39;t say], is NOTORIOUS for giving Freshman their first failing exam score.

</div><div class="md"><p>I really don&#39;t see a problem in learning programming on this laptop. You won&#39;t have up to date languages mostly due to your laptop not being able to run the latest IDE, but you would only miss on a few things, if not any since you are starting. I looked around a bit to give you an idea of what you could try, based on popular languages (except web because I don&#39;t really know much on that part). Assuming you have 1gb of ram you could do the below:</p>

<p>C# and Basic: I wouldn&#39;t go newer than visual studio 2008,  you could code on .net3.5 if you have XP SP2, which in my opinion is already complete enough to do anything you want. You could even use Sharpdevelop as IDE, it would be less bloated.</p>

<p>Java: You could go with java 6 which again is new enough, using eclipse 3.2 or 3.3 as IDE should run well. If you could run 3.7 then you could program with java 7 but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s really worth it except if its not slower.</p>

<p>Python would work very well with its IDE (IDLE), I wouldn&#39;t try PyCharm though.</p>

<p>C++: Again, Visual studio and eclipse.</p>

<p>If you want to do some SQL, maybe you could go with SQL Lite, nothing heavy to install and very useful.</p>

<p>Going for Git version control, that would be a good opportunity to learn the command line because the window application is a bit heavy. It&#39;s probably better this way anyway.</p>

<p>There are definitely much more that you could do and your computer won&#39;t prevent you to learn it.</p>

<p>Anyone wants to add to this or correct me?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, you could use the same analogy for any tool. Some of it might amount to personal preference. Some of it is legitimate differences in functionality. For example, doing any substantial programming in Notepad would be painful.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay good to know. </p>

<p>So don&#39;t pirate Windows then. Look into Ubuntu. Like I said it&#39;s graphically polished (great UI) and is the most popular Linux distribution out there which means great support online. It is also very good for beginners since you are not required (but recommended) to use the terminal. Good luck. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Working while touring the Grand Canyon and that big ball of twine outside of Kansas City sounds kind of dull too.      </p>

<p>Could be a good time if you can pull it off.   I think you&#39;ll have trouble finding someone to give you remote work without any prior experience to back it up.  Generally, freelance work comes from references from past work completed so I&#39;m having trouble thinking of what sort of development job you might land assuming you manage to master the craft in the next few months.       </p>

<p>Generally, when you&#39;re paid to do work, the employer has some expectation of timely progress.  I think you would find that difficult to provide.      </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>My main concern with such an old machine isn&#39;t that it might not run the programming tools you need (it will, those tools tend to have <em>very</em> low requirements), but that it might be really slow and/or dangerous to use online. Microsoft no longer supports XP with security updates, and a great deal of Web material these days relies on HTML5 stuff that actually requires fairly up-to-date hardware not to slow to a crawl. And believe me, you <em>will</em> need to look stuff up online when you&#39;re learning programming.</p>

<p>If you do decide to use it, make sure to backup your code frequently. For an old laptop, a hard drive failure is a very real risk.</p>

<p>And says that they have no experience in Linux. </p>

<p>Normally I would tell anyone to use Linux, but this is out of the question. </p>

<p>With these in mind, piracy is the only option if OP doesn&#39;t want to spend any money and upgrade.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Maybe he doesn&#39;t want to pirate? Not everyone rides that train. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I agree that reading more books about mathematical models and algorithms aren&#39;t going to help as much at this point, but if he doesn&#39;t read something about the architecture of large maintainable systems, and isn&#39;t learning from someone experienced then there&#39;s a lot he&#39;s not going to learn. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Easy there, Blackbeard.  Let&#39;s not go recommending that people break the law.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Some editors have fancy coloring for different languages, not just black on white text which can be easier to read and to detect misspelled words during typing. There are some other extra features, that are nice but not necessary. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Most people I know dont even have Windows XP and they are still broke as fuck. Can&#39;t even afford gas. So don&#39;t tell me you are poor and still use Windows XP. You can pirate Windows 7 or something else that can run o 2005 hardware. I am not telling OP to upgrade, since OP already said they dont want to. I am just curious why XP. </p>

<p>Also, OP needs to know that keeping an OS way after it was discontinued is bad in terms of security since Microsoft isn&#39;t patching it anymore. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just another OS; open source in this case.  There are distributions that are intended to run on older hardware and Linux in general has lesser requirements to be able to run acceptably.

</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s not absurd, it&#39;s prudent. If you don&#39;t have any because it&#39;s proprietary, that&#39;s fine, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt to ask. </p>

<p>Also prioritize your courses, try to get as much time for your important classes, like your major stuff. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Mainly security. It is also a lot streamlined which makes it run faster on older hardware, hence why there are a bunch of articles saying &quot;breathe new life to your old hardware with Linux&quot;.</p>

<p>Since you are new to Linux, I highly suggest you use Ubuntu, which is extremely polished and requires no extensive knowledge of command line or coding to use. Heck, it is even used as the default operating system on System76 computers. </p>

<p>EDIT: Okay who the fuck keeps downvoting me for posting relevant and unbiased FACTS that are not even contested? </p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Then stick it into your head that getting anything other than an A is unacceptable.</p>

<p>I disagree with this statement. While getting the best grade possible should be important, you shouldn&#39;t force goals upon yourself that may be unrealistic. For instance, what if you get Professor Trying to Defeat Grade Inflation By Himself, who speaks with the thickest of Indian accents and doesn&#39;t take questions? Maybe you get a B in a class that you can&#39;t figure out why it is a core requirement. Should you change your major? Probably not.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>OK calm down. I know a lot of people who are broke but still have moved past XP. You could have just pirated whatever your system can support like 7. What are your specs? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I know my languages and core frameworks very well, which means I can make informed decisions about architecture taking into account performance, accuracy, consistency, etc. very quickly. I also have experience running a project and interacting with key stake holders well (&quot;soft&quot; skills). I explore outside of my immediate needs and am always learning, which has made me a fount of esoteric knowledge on lots of stuff I&#39;ll probably never use, and yet I still recognize that there are people way better than me that I still aspire to.</p>

<p>All the senior positions I&#39;ve held emphasized more skills outside of programming, like the project management, people skills, mentoring juniors, etc.  They also set technical direction along with leads, as they have to have enough knowledge to make good architectural decisions. They are people you&#39;d trust to deal with issues efficiently and correctly and to take the initiative to do so.</p>

<p>Basically: experienced in programming, experienced in design, experienced in some amount of management and self-direction, and being responsible.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have zero experience with Linux, but I always hear good things about it. Could you give a quick ELI5 version of what advantages it has over Windows, particularly with basic stuff?</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>i don&#39;t know [...] I guess I didn&#39;t study enough</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s a problem. If you failed on a test, it means that the way you were studying either wasn&#39;t sufficient, was misguided, or was conducted inefficiently. </p>

<p>I&#39;d spend some time reflecting on this and try and determine why exactly you failed and what you need to improve on. This act of reflecting on your own thoughts and actions is called <strong>metacognition</strong>.</p>

<p>After each test or assignment, you should always take a moment to pause and reflect on what went right, what went wrong, and what you need to change or adjust for next time. Your attention should be turned both outwards and inwards -- both on the course material, and on how you went about learning it.</p>

<p>You should never accept ignorance and throw your hands up and give up on trying to find what the root issues are. Never accept defeat, never accept resignation, and always strive to understand better and more precisely. After all, the entire point of attending college is to learn, and that includes learning about yourself, your capacities, and weaknesses. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re stumped, and don&#39;t know what you need to do in order to get better, go talk to the teacher, describe how you studied and prepped for the exam, and see if he or she can help you come up with more effective strategies for studying in the future. This is part of their job, and unless your teacher is grossly incompetent or unsuited to teaching, they&#39;ll be more then happy to help you with this.</p>

<p>In fact, I teach a class on programming, and I can definitely say that students who talk to us, ask us for advice, and make a strong effort to study are always our favorite students. After all, we wouldn&#39;t be teaching a class unless we enjoy the topic on some level, and it&#39;s always exciting finding students who share that same interest. As a result, any decent teacher will be more than happy to help for the sake of that shared passion.</p>

<p>In any case, here are some articles/videos about metacognition and how it applies to studying:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.samford.edu/how-to-study/">How to get the most out of studying</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.studygs.net/metacognitiona.htm">Learning to learn</a></li>
<li><a href="http://academic.pg.cc.md.us/%7Ewpeirce/MCCCTR/metacognition.htm">Metacognition: Study Strategies, Monitoring, and Motivation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.education.com/reference/article/Ref_Dev_Metacognition/">Developing metacognition</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The later two articles are geared more towards teachers, but still might be useful to read to understand the underlying theory. I&#39;m personally a fan of the first link/video series -- I think it&#39;s a good introduction to effective studying in general.</p>

<p>It might also be good to try and find study centers at your school and ask for tips and help on studying in general. Something a lot of students don&#39;t realize is that there are right and wrong ways to study, and understanding how to study effectively is very definitely an skill that can be trained and honed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Because I don&#39;t have any fucking money</p>

Then stick it into your head that getting anything other than an A is unacceptable. Nobody wants to be stuck with a C doctor. </p>

<p>You need to put a ton of effort into your coursework. College is very different. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re a freshman. You need to learn to study quick and make sure you enjoy what you&#39;re studying otherwise it won&#39;t matter how much you&#39;re studying. </p>

<p>The thing I remember about it was that you have to write your own code using pencil and paper. Which is a pain in the butt, but overall not too hard.</p>

<p>Honestly, just understand basic concepts and know how to read code pretty well.</p>

<p>I think I recall sorting algorithms being a big part of the test somehow.</p>

<p>Really spend time on arrays and for-loops. I mean, learn to read and trace them.</p>

<p>Know some GUI code and whatnot, but I do not think that is a very major part of the test.</p>

<p>Overall, just strengthen your knowledge on class hierarchy/structure, inheritance, arrays, for-loops, sorting algorithms, methods. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I think what your professor was trying to do was make your temp and actual arrays one array. Think of a 3D array as a bunch of 2D arrays stacked on top of each other. So array 0 is the first array and array 1 is the temp array.</p>

<p>That being said, you&#39;ve written a lot of code and you probably don&#39;t want to rewrite your program.
I think what your proffesser was trying to have you do is:</p>

<pre><code>draw in array 0/error check in array 1
render screen from array 0

draw in array 1/ error check in array 0
render screen from array 1

loop

</div><div class="md"><p>C# is not a proprietary language and can be coded on Linux.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Seriously. Most entry level programming positions are going to want running code samples. Basically every programming job I applied for when I got out of college wanted to see working applications from my time in school.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This could easily be solved by providing a pastebin link to the source, no?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t have the code for the 2d array anymore because it was erased when my professor changed the code. </p>

<p>Basically it was kind of the same issue right now where when it was shifting over it was erasing everything. </p>

<p>But the professor suggested I use the 3d array and debug it and figure out the problem...but i can&#39;t figure out the problem. Sorry if that was vague</p>

<p>if anything at least the 3d array&#39;s error isn&#39;t as big as major as previously..... lol</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I recommend Linux as well. The only thing you can&#39;t do on Linux is a proprietary language like c#. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s say I asked you to implement a skip list in your language of choice. You&#39;d be allowed to use Internet resources, but not copy any code directly. Would you be able to do it?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Humans were sent to space with far less.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, why did you fail?  The reason why the test went badly is probably more important than the fact that the test went poorly.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What errors did you have with the 2d array?  The solution to a problem isn&#39;t to add another &#39;d&#39; to the array while still not figuring out either the first solution or the new solution. I&#39;d stick with the 2d array since that&#39;s conceptually simpler and you don&#39;t even know how a 3d array will help.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The real difficulty in this question is not finding the country with the largest population, or the country with the largest population for a given continent. Those are both simple.</p>

<p>It&#39;s finding the single largest country in <em>each</em> continent.</p>

<p>So you need to have a way to compare each country with all the other countries in the same continent.</p>

<p>So it&#39;s like &quot;find the country whose area is greater than or equal to all the countries in its continent&quot;. In order to do that you can&#39;t just do a single select, because you need two lists of all countries. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:</p>

<p>To look at it another way, if you do this (taking out the aliases):</p>

<pre><code>SELECT continent, name, population FROM world 
  WHERE population &gt;= ALL
    (SELECT population FROM world 
    WHERE continent = continent
      AND population&gt;0)
</code></pre>

<p>you get only one result, China. Because <code>WHERE continent = continent</code> becomes meaningless. You get the single biggest country in <em>any</em> continent.</p>

<p>But if we &quot;pretend&quot; that we have two different tables, SQL matches them up and we get one result per continent. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you feel like you did your best, then I&#39;d give it serious thought.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>that&#39;s literally what i did initially.</p>

<p>I had the tetris_grid array and then for movement I declared a temporary array to store the movement. That being said there was still errors that occurred when doing that </p>

<p>but when I took it to office hours my professor removed the code and set it as a 3d array, and ive never really learned 3d array (first class ever) so now im just super confused...</p>

<p>im assuming maybe this 3d array will be helpful down the line when it comes to the collision aspect </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you just have a single 2d array?</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>So that&#39;s why I have to give <strong>world</strong> an alias, then? Because I am referencing it twice? I think I understand.</p>

<p>What about the line <strong>WHERE y.continent=x.continent</strong>?</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out why this part is necessary and what exactly it does. </p>

<p>I assume <strong>y.continent</strong> is referring to the continent column in (world)y, and it will be compared with the same in x, but I&#39;m not sure why they are necessary or what exactly they&#39;re doing in this particular query.</p>

<p>I understand the last line (<strong>AND area&gt;0</strong>) is basically <strong>IS NOT NULL</strong>, correct? </p>

<li>For convenience.  Aliases are usually shorter and easier to type.  (e.g. you can shorten the table <code>users</code> to the alias <code>u</code>)</li>
<li>Required when the same table participates multiple times in one query.  This is common in several queries; notably, hierarchical queries.  For instance, aliases are necessary to identify the correct table in the following query:</li>
</ul>

<p>query:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT
    e.employeeName,
    manager.employeeName as &#39;name of boss/manager&#39;
FROM employees e
JOIN employees manager
    ON e.managerEmployeeId = manager.employeeId

<p>Basically, after down the button that moves the block to the right some of the blocks will disappear</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You could do it that way. A different way might be simpler, though: compare all pairs, then check the number that are equal.</p>

<pre><code>n_equal_pairs == 0 // scalene
// ... etc.
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I assume A, B and C are the length of the sides.</p>

<p>In this case:</p>

<pre><code>//Equilateral
//A == C is implicitly true here
if(A == B &amp;&amp; B == C) {}

//Isosceles
//At least two sides must be equal
if(A == B || B == C || C == A){}
</code></pre>

<p>Hope that helps!</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>So I will not be answering your question, but I need to ask why you have a Windows XP laptop that you will not upgrade? Laptops are getting cheaper by the year and I am pretty sure you can get a new one for at least 300 bucks. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, so why do I need  <strong>WHERE y.continent=x.continent</strong>?</p>

<p>And why do I need to give them aliases at all?</p>

<p>Sorry, I&#39;m incredibly new at this. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The AP CS exam is a joke. I&#39;ve seen kids failing the class get 5/5</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Managing your own memory allows you to control how and when memory is recovered. Sometimes you&#39;ll run your application and you&#39;ll notice slowdowns for seemingly no reason. No trace shows a problem and there are no bugs. Is it IO? Maybe, but you&#39;re probably noticing the garbage collector running.</p>

<p>In general, the nice thing about a C app is that your entire application isn&#39;t stacked like a Jenga tower of frameworks and API&#39;s... each one introducing its own set of undocumented features. If you wrote it, it&#39;s your fault, but at least you can fix it. I&#39;ve spent days tracing bugs only to find a bug in a framework and if there isn&#39;t a new release, there&#39;s nothing I can do except switch frameworks.</p>

<p>It&#39;s just a kind of workaround to select twice from the same table.</p>

<p>You can do this using the &quot;AS&quot; keyword (<em>SELECT continent, name, area FROM world AS x</em>) which makes things clearer, but it&#39;s optional.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I would say it depends on what sort of programming you want to learn. For many things you just need, at a minimum anyway, a text editor.You probably don&#39;t need a new machine but should consider running an up to date OS. Have you considered Linux? You should be able to find a distro that will run well on older hardware. Perhaps others with more experience than myself will chime in soon.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The Arduino is basically a set of libraries and IDE for an Atmel microcontroller, usually an AVR.</p>

<p>Yeah, I agree with you, as a first instance it would be better to use the build-in SPI port, and then from there try and move to the bridge. The only reason the bridge comes into the game is because at one point I would like to move the display to an x86 platform, and I would be forced to use the bridge. But that can be done at a later time. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Is &quot;prior use&quot; not so much of a thing in the states? That seems arbitrary.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes that is what is happening. I am allocating a byte array with byte[] imagebuf = new byte[size]; and the jpgsize also is modified to hold a new value.</p>

<p>So if this is the case, do I need out for the buffer definition, or is there no ref/out in that definition?</p>

<p>Edit: You got it. Feel like an idiot now, just blanked on what byte[] meant. Forgot how arrays worked somehow. Thanks for the help.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What OS are you using?  With a linux distro like Ubuntu, you can use the OS tools to install PyQt4 like this:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get search pyqt4</code></p>

<p>find an appropriate package to install, and do so:</p>

<p><code>sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4</code></p>

<p>In this case <code>apt-get</code> takes care of package dependencies by installing <code>python3-sip</code> for you.</p>

<p>Or if you&#39;re running Continuum Anaconda (python distro, works on both Windows and Linux), it already comes with PyQt4 installed, and sip, so <code>pip install easygui_qt</code> works right off.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If anyone is really good at making C# tutorial videos there&#39;s a serious shortage of these on Lynda.com. I would love to intersperse learning C# ASP.NET from books with a few video tutorials.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have almost zero code to my name that I can just share because it belongs to some company or another. Any of my code that is public is trash I developed at hackathons or just some script I made.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always about problem solving and getting shit done. Telling stories about what I did to solve problems is much more important than the exact details, although sometimes the details are fun and worth remembering. I think engineering is about the pride associated with long term accomplishments.</p>

<p>My portfolio is filled with published papers and projects with the accomplishments I did. Currently I&#39;m filling it up with interesting experiences from my current job. Not everyone can publish papers in scientific conferences (nature of the work I did), but anyone can fill it with accomplishments for projects.</p>

<p>I would recommend describing the last project you did, what you built, what challenges you overcome, what things you learned, what mistakes were made, etc. I think that is a much better approach than a resume thanks to:<br/>
<a href="https://www.getkeepsafe.com/noresume.html">https://www.getkeepsafe.com/noresume.html</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I can speak to Vim being decent for HTML and CSS (and to a lesser extent, I&#39;d give it a thumbs up for C... though I don&#39;t work with that in any real capacity... I&#39;d figure C++ should be similar). I&#39;d have to figure Python would be just as nice (though I do have a fondness for IDLE there...). C# is something I&#39;d stick with Visual Studio (free Community Edition even!) or Sharp/MonoDevelop (MonoDevelop is Xamarin Studio now, if I recall correctly).</p>

<p>Anyhow, as others have said... text is just text, and for a chunk of what you&#39;ve identified, the edit vs. compile cycle will work as separate pieces (though an IDE might be nice).</p>

<p>I find myself growing fonder of Vim the more I use it.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I find it easier to make edits (i.e. single keypresses (for the most part) allow me to make edits quickly and accurately... Nice to be able to do a c-i-t to change the inner content of a tag, or a c-t-{char} to change to a block of code. Block editing, macros and other nifty features (windows) eventually make things extra nice... even if you use only use them on occasion.</p>

<p>(Vim is also AWESOME on large files!)</p>

<p>Overall, Vim is a beautifully built piece of software with a long history (longer still if you reach back to vi) and it&#39;s elegant... It&#39;s the scalpel to Emacs&#39; Swiss Army Knife.</p>

<p>Having said all that... If I hadn&#39;t given Vim a go, I&#39;d probably still be happily using something like Notepad++ or SciTE for general text editing...</p>

<p>To each their own, but... if you&#39;re interested in Vim... give it a serious go and see what you think (just don&#39;t expect miracles out of the gate...). Also, don&#39;t feel that you have to use EVERYTHING (I use a fairly minimally tweaked version of Vim and anything more would feel awkward/awful at this stage... and I&#39;m not a long-time Vim user).</p>

<p>Also keep in mind that Vim is cross-platform (though MacVim doesn&#39;t seem to play through as nicely as Linux/Windows versions of gVim...) which is a big plus in that you get to use the same thing across programming languages -- and platforms!</p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, so if you run Linux, then you&#39;ll want to figure out the SPI driver for the Odroid. I personally would start with the built-in, simply just a gut preference to avoid a bridge. <a href="http://forum.odroid.com/viewtopic.php?f=80&amp;t=5702">Here</a> is some initial information that you can use to track down more.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s a close match to the SPI driver on the Arduino (I know next to nothing about those, is it running Linux, or no OS, or what?), then it might not be too hard.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Adding a little bit to it, FTDI provides an API for their own SPI bridge:</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO/blob/master/Adafruit_GPIO/FT232H.py">https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO/blob/master/Adafruit_GPIO/FT232H.py</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can use any text editor to write code. But for some of those languages (Java, and to a lesser extent, C++), you might wind up with a lot of source files, and it&#39;ll be easier to use an actual IDE.</p>

<p>Also, emacs. (What? I prefer modeless editors)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Using Bi-directional search to solve a puzzle game is one</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tip, that&#39;s a good place to start, as the AVR SPI library uses ports directly on the microcontroller, and I&#39;m pretending to either use a USB-to-SPI bridge or the built-in SPI port on the Odroid U3+.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Can you give examples of tasks you were given that you had absolutely no plan of action on how to tackle them?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Nothing I can show anyone. It&#39;s essentially empty. </p>

<p>I can tell you what I wrote and how I built it and why decisions were made but i can&#39;t put my code on github due to privacy concerns. </p>

<p>Additionally a significant portion of my code is for manipulating and adapting other pieces of software to suit our needs. A collection of triggers, views, functions, and obscure api calls only tells you I know how to use visual studio&#39;s code formatting function and that I understand the software. But without context of the limitations of the base software my code is stupid (because the limitations or design of the base is stupid.) </p>

<p>The only things i can show anyone are a collection of chrome extensions I use to overcome daily workflow issues and some video game theory crafting software I contributed to a long time ago. </p>

<p>However, what I feel is more important is being able to build code at a conceptual level in a senior position.  This is not universally true for larger teams where the senior developer is responsible for the code and not the design, but on smaller teams it is absolutely crucial. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>When I was originally still coming up with ideas I had a passing thought to randomize two new variables. If x &gt; y... well, you get the idea. I really need to work on thinking simple, hahaha.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just had a job interview. So I can confirm this. Thankfully, they cared more about the logic.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yep. Like Python.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, this is what I am afraid of. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://trentrichardson.com/2013/12/16/sort-dom-elements-jquery/">http://trentrichardson.com/2013/12/16/sort-dom-elements-jquery/</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just so you know, you will continue see the light, but more importantly continue to hit walls no matter how junior/senior you are.  I&#39;m an architect for a fortune 500 major retail company and there isn&#39;t a year that goes by that I feel inefficient because I can&#39;t grasp some new technology, new language, new features.   It&#39;s something that you have to understand at an early stage that growing requires you to hit walls and breaking through them, constantly.  It never ends, I feel comfortable because now i understand that I&#39;ll never feel comfortable with my complete skillset. That&#39;s something that I&#39;ll have embraced and know that I always have to be learning, at least generally about what I don&#39;t know.   </p>

<p>As someone who is expected to understand most new concepts by all of the team members, it&#39;s just an extra burden that I&#39;ve embraced that means that I will spend more time learning about the entire landscape of development, not just about our technology stack (but mostly so), but learning what the other windows, linux, and even the script kiddies are doing and discovering trends.  This is definitely a challenge but something you get used to by the time you&#39;ve been doing this 10-12 years or so.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad you feel a little less, scared, and this insn&#39;t meant to scare you, but to let you know, that this moment of discovery happens every year from hear on in.  You will continue to add layers of ability that will make you a very talented developer.  </p>

<p>Good luck.</p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>You never need this. Just pass no arguments to get the same result:</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println();
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Also, you might consider taking a laracast approach. Check out their site and look at some of the free videos to get an idea.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>yeah, that&#39;d be swell.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have some familiarity with device drivers, though not the specific devices in question. I personally would have to start by learning about the devices themselves. Then I would read through AVR-C library to get a general understanding of the flow. Then I&#39;d read the driver documentation for the FT232H, and observe how it maps to the AVR-C library. If the mapping is relatively close, then I&#39;ll just start porting, though it might really be more of a rewrite than a port.</p>

<p>EDIT: I&#39;d probably first start by looking through the API to the SPI library used in the AVR-C code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Agreed. With text/code examples you can scan. With videos... not so much. Way too time consuming.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I agree. While Python isn&#39;t the only choice, there&#39;s no need to learn PHP when you have no attachment to it. There&#39;s better language choices for someone who&#39;s just starting (in that position, any language works).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here you go: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+api+cpu+usage">https://www.google.com/search?q=windows+api+cpu+usage</a>.  (Ugh, the Windows APIs are totally insane.)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Javascript next then PYTHON, not PHP.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Nice code! This is very readable and concise. The only thing that stood out to me is this line:</p>

<pre><code>self.states[linkstate].transitions[targetstate] += 1
</code></pre>

<p>Usually we try to limit the number of chained calls we have to make. It would be nice if you could do something like:</p>

<pre><code>self.states[linkstate].increase(targetstate)
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah, I think I can handle it, or at least I can follow the code itself. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the tip!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh god, I feel so stupid now. Thanks!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Would you mind pming me an excerpt of your code so I can see what you did?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t really care to write html or css in vim. C# is probably best in Visual Studios. I also like to use sublime text to write java or c++ then compile in terminal. Whatever you can easily customize to be aesthetically pleasing while meeting your demands is fine, really. Some jobs might force you to use a certain IDE or something but it shouldn&#39;t be a big hindrance. For example, I work for a software as a service company and our platform is written primarily in C# and a visual studios project. Thought I can use whatever else I want to write code if I don&#39;t need the entire project to be built.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Do you know C?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks! I&#39;ve never heard of PDO but I&#39;ll do some reading.</p>

<p>Any idea how to make the results forward to a page upon a click, without a following button press or pressing enter? Would this be done with a form submit? If so, how is this done without a submit button?</p>

<p>Thanks again.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Looking at your code (and by the way, please work on your indentation, it&#39;s really hard to read) I see the following:</p>

<p><code>void read_from_pipe (int file) // transmiter</code></p>

<p><code>void write_to_pipe (int file) // reciever</code></p>

<p>A transmitter does <em>not</em> read from a pipe, it <em>writes</em> to a pipe.</p>

<p>A receiver does <em>not</em> write to a pipe, it <em>receives</em> from a pipe.</p>

<p>Your receiver, which is confusingly called &#39;write_to_pipe&#39; is not reading any data from the pipe, it&#39;s just writing its buffer to the output file. That output will be whatever garbage values happen to be in the memory your buffer is located at (which is dangerous as the printf() is probably accessing data beyond the end of the buffer, unless there happens to be a &#39;\0&#39; in the buffer by pure luck).</p>

<p>As I said above - your receiver needs to read <em>from</em> the pipe, <strong>into the buffer</strong>. You can then write the buffer to the output file.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to sound harsh, but you&#39;re making some very basic mistakes here which should be clear if you follow the logic of what you&#39;re trying to do. Keep working on it - you&#39;ll get there :-)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I am running Win7 64bit. Ill have to give that a try.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The interesting thing about programming is that things that you don&#39;t know are invisible, so you really have no context to know how much you know versus how much you don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>If you&#39;ve only been doing it for a couple of months I would take a guess there is still a <em>lot</em> left to learn.</p>

<p>Wanting to learn the fundamentals is good as well though. My personal recommendation would be to pick up a Java textbook and go through that. It will describe all the absolute basics, and eventually progress through harder and harder stuff. </p>

<p>Books are better than online tutorials because they do not miss content, their content isn&#39;t scattered all around, they tend to go in a linear and logical order.</p>

<p>Also, you may feel tempted to skip over things because you think the topic is too easy. Just go through it and learn all the content it is trying to teach you. These books also tend to have programming exercises in the back. Do these! Do all of them. This is so important, because it reinforces the topics you&#39;ve just learned. I&#39;d also recommend buying s notebook and taking notes as you go. When you take information in, then write it down in your own words it forces you to internalise the knowledge, helping you remember them a bit better.</p>

<p>I would also recommend reevaluating what you think you know. I did a 4 year software engineering degree, and it was only until the third year when I started feeling really confident in my coding and knowledge of computer science. It takes a long time to build up your knowledge store :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I guess I wouldn&#39;t know where to begin. The way I use it now is by compiling using the Arduino IDE. </p>

<p>The rest of my app is being done in Python 2.7. How could I use this library from Python?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What&#39;s your function that writes to the file? Verify that it&#39;s working by using a print statement. I think you&#39;ll discover something.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not a senior programmer, but here&#39;s a different view, for those looking for one. I am a CS major who&#39;s finishing up his third year.</p>

<p>My portfolio is small due to the fact that I&#39;ve been working part time jobs for a very long time, and thus don&#39;t have the kind of free time I wish I did. Project classes in school are a great way to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<li><p><a href="https://github.com/MikeHoffert/fbms">FBMS</a>: A Java backup and versioning system that works like an offline Dropbox. Backs up a folder to a local location (eg, on a network drive). Keeps track of diffs rather than full files (for plain text). Has a GUI to explore the backup (backup is stored in an SQLite DB), compare changes, recover files, etc. Already outdated in terms of style, since I now require personal projects to have a way to build them from a single command.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://cmpt371g1.usask.ca/">EatSafe Saskatchewan</a>: Current project I&#39;m working on for a project management class. Code is private until after the final exam. Allows for searching through health inspection records of restaurants in the province. Programmed in Scala with the Play Framework. Still a WIP.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve added several features to <a href="https://github.com/MikeHoffert/megaglest-source">MegaGlest</a>, a FOSS RTS. I&#39;ve been involved with that community for a while (and have released some non-programming related mods). Eventually decided I didn&#39;t want to work on it anymore because the code is so poorly structured and there&#39;s almost no documentation.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#39;ve implemented the auto-refreshing and desktop notifications of the <a href="http://play.mg/">MegaGlest masterserver</a> (which has a stylistic overhaul planned).</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/MikeHoffert/FingerprintAnonymizer">Fingerprint anonymizer</a>: A proof of concept for blocking browser fingerprinting techniques (which could be used to track users). It&#39;s a Chrome extension. Don&#39;t look into it too much, because it was nothing more than a proof of concept and has some bugs that were never fixed (it was for an info sec class).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;ve also got a few on-hold WIPs. I&#39;d hope to complete them when I have more time.</p>

<ol>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/MikeHoffert/easy-append">Easy Append</a> was supposed to be a way to do text additions. It&#39;s quite simple (but fully functional) as it is. An example use is to create license or attribution headers for files. I had planned to implement a conditional system that can make additions or replacements based on traits of the file, but never got around to it. Was also planning to make a GUI as a way to learn JavaFX.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/MikeHoffert/on-hover-images">On-hover Images</a> was supposed to be a Firefox addon to view images by hovering over them. The only Firefox addon I found that does this was missing features I wanted to see and frequently acted up, so I figured I&#39;d roll my own. Got as far as getting normal links to work before I started a new job and ran out of free time.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Then I&#39;ve got some work experience:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Worked with a large Java simulation system during a summer at my university. This was mostly about increasing the quality of the program and not about implementing novel features. So tons of refactoring, testing, documenting, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Worked with a small company as a full stack developer with Scala, the Play Framework, and the usual front end stuff.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And by the time I graduate, I&#39;ll have a 16 month internship under my belt, as well (which will involve C# and ASP.NET).</p>

<p>Of course, as you can see, I somewhat grasp for straws with regard to what I call my portfolio. Some things are fairly minor compared to others (like a few days of work). I&#39;d hope to flesh that out in the future. Especially once I stop working two jobs at once (full time student + some part time job).</p>

<p>On Linux, for example, there&#39;s the <code>/proc</code> filesystem which presents a bunch of &quot;virtual&quot; files that contain a variety of system-level information.  You can get all the information you&#39;re asking about by simply reading from those files like any other file.</p>

<p>Other operating systems do things differently.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Right, so the assignment is pretty much what I said originally. </p>

<p>Your parent process (transmitter) will need to open an input file for reading in the normal way. This has nothing to do with the pipe. </p>

<p>Your child process will need to open an output file for writing in the normal way. This has nothing to do with the pipe.</p>

<p>Then, you need to create the pipe between the transmitter and the receiver. The transmitter will:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Read 100 bytes from the input file (or less if the end of file is reached) into a buffer</p></li>
<li><p>Write the buffer to the pipe</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The receiver will:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Read 100 bytes from the pipe</p></li>
<li><p>Write those 100 bytes to the output file</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You will have 2 file descriptors of relevance on each side. The parent will use:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The file descriptor of the input file</p></li>
<li><p>The file descriptor of its end of the pipe</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The receiver will use:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The file descriptor of the output file</p></li>
<li><p>The file descriptor of its end of the pipe.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is more information on how to create the pipe - <a href="http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node11.html">http://www.tldp.org/LDP/lpg/node11.html</a>. You&#39;ll have to add the input and output file code yourself of course.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>This is basically what I have to do to make things clear:</p>

<p>a) You will create a child process which will be the transmitter process that sends messages to the parent which is the receiver process. You will use pipes to communicate between the processes.
i) The transmitter process reads a file and sends the content of the file to the receiver process.</p>

<p>ii) The files should be read using the fread function in C so that the data is read in bytes. You should read 100 bytes of data at a time.</p>

<p>iii) The transmitter process then writes the data into the pipe using fwrite so that the receiver process can read the data.</p>

<p>iv) The receiver process uses fread to read the data (100 bytes at a time). The reading stops when fread returns less than 0 bytes which indicates that the file has ended.</p>

<p>v) The receiver process prints the data it has read into another file using fprintf.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Your question doesn&#39;t make complete sense to me. Pipes don&#39;t &quot;write to an external file&quot;, they are intended such that the standard output from one process is linked to the standard input of a second process. Well, <em>technically</em> it doesn&#39;t have to be stdout to stdin, but that&#39;s invariably what they are used for. Either way, data written to a file descriptor in process A arrives as input to a file descriptor in process B, the pipe is the &#39;link&#39; that connects the two. If the second process is supposed to write the data that was piped to it to an external file then it would have to open that external file and copy the bytes arriving at stdin to the external file, just as if it was copying one file to another. </p>

<p>At a good school, you will be worked much harder, but also receive good education :)</p>

<p>The SaaS course I list at the bottom of my thread is from UC Berkeley and is an <em>introductory</em> course to web architecture there.</p>

<p>You will get some initial exposure to databases, programming, computer science.  Then you can move straight into web architecture, more computer science, scaling and deployments.  Computer science is a deep field and the web is only one part of it.  You do not typically go to university just to study &quot;web development&quot;.</p>

<p>It used to be that <a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/">SICP</a> (structure and interpretation of computer programs - which relates to computation, compilers and languages) was CS 101 at MIT.  Similarly, Computer Science 101 at Harvard was <a href="http://www.nand2tetris.org/">NAND to Tetris</a> which has you building a computer and programming language in a virtual environment from the hardware up.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Think of it as legos. </p>

<p>There are many different pieces and tools that you can use to write a program, but many of them are interchangeable with each other. Programmers generally hate being forced into a single option, or being locked down and forced to use a particular setup, so in many cases programmers will deliberately go out of their way to make sure that they have multiple options and ways of writing code.</p>

<p>For example, in order to write code, you need a text editor or an IDE. You could use Notepad, Vim, Emacs, Sublime Text, Atom, Nano, Eclipse, Intellij, etc -- the list goes on and one.</p>

<p>However, each and every single one of these programs will produce the exact same thing -- a text file containing code.</p>

<p>You can then take this text file (which again can be written using anything you want), and can feed it into any arbitrary compiler or interpreter. For example, take C++, for example. You could take this text file and feed it into GCC, into Clang, into Visual Studios -- those are all examples of compilers that can take the same text file and turn it into code your computer can understand.</p>

<p>The same principle will apply to pretty much every single programming language in existence. You write your code in what&#39;s essentially a text file using any text editing tool (and give it a special file extension like <code>.java</code> or <code>.html</code> to keep the files easily distinguishable), then give that text file to whatever program can understand it.</p>

<p>Basically, for the most part, there&#39;s no inherent relationship between the tool used to write your code, and the tool used to execute it. The text file is an open medium that mediates the two.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s right.</p>

<p>How to draw a 12x12 times table:</p>

<ul>
<li>Draw row 1.</li>
<li>Draw row 2.</li>
<li>Draw row 3.</li>
<li>... and so forth</li>
<li>Draw row 12.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s accomplished by a for loop (that&#39;s why you have the <code>for int row = 1; row &lt;= 12; row++)</code>).</p>

<p>Then, the question becomes &quot;how do I actually draw a single row?&quot;</p>

<p>Well, to draw the ith row, you simply do:</p>

<ul>
<li>print <code>i * 1</code></li>
<li>print <code>i * 2</code></li>
<li>print <code>i * 3</code></li>
<li>...</li>
<li>print <code>i * 12</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So that&#39;s a for loop that goes from 1 to 12.  That&#39;s why there are 2 for loops.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It sounds like it would make more sense to move what&#39;s currently in my constructor into the <code>next()</code> function.

All I know is that it&#39;s used to create an object later.</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip on randomizing the operators. I thought about using Booleans somehow, but couldn&#39;t figure out what would be the best way. I didn&#39;t realize there was actually a function for that. I&#39;ll have to remember to look harder next time.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>If you want to start with a hands-on approach, download <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/index.html">Weka</a> and check out some tutorials or Youtube videos. </p>

<p>Weka is a tool that makes a huge amount of complicated math and computer science available to anyone. There is a lot of sample material to e.g. predict the weather or if somebody needs contact lenses, based on previously known data points (the essence of machine learning). It has a GUI and you don&#39;t need any programming experience to get started.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Gotcha! Well, it&#39;s all LaTeX making my documents look good. I don&#39;t think I did too much style-wise myself.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah, I figured it out like five minutes after I posted. I guess my brain started freezing up after stressing about it for so long</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There is a lot wrong here, but here are a few things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You try to call functions by saying</p>

<pre><code>def &quot;function name&quot;. 
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>That defines a function, so call functions like this:</p>

<pre><code>    function()
</code></pre>

<ol>
<li><p>Functions need to be called outside of functions if you want them to run, so at the end add something like:</p>

<pre><code>Ans()

StartGame()

main()
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Here is how to write an if-else if block:</p>

<pre><code>if b &gt; 10:

    print(&#39;b is greater than 10&#39;)

elif b &gt; 5:

    print(&#39;b is greater than 5, but less than 10&#39;)
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>In counter(), you should really use a for loop.</p></li>
<li><p>You need to import some kind of random library</p></li>
<li><p>This is general design advice, but you should test your program constantly. You should be making sure every single function works once you write it by running your program. </p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="md"><p>So may I ask how I would go about this?</p>

<p>I set a variable time before I began coloring</p>

<pre><code>long time=System.currentTimeMillis();   
</code></pre>

<p>then I created another variable after all coloring was finished</p>

<pre><code>long currTime=System.currentTimeMillis();
</code></pre>

<p>Next I subtracted the two</p>

<pre><code>long duration=currTime-time;
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, I subtracted the two and printed to the screen using Graphics2D </p>

<pre><code>g2.drawString(&quot;Time: &quot;+((Integer)timeCount).toString(), 80, 10);
</code></pre>

<p>My logic is, because I stored the time in those variables, the time wouldnt update any longer, instead once I draw to the screen it continues to count upward. Is this a feature of currentTimeMillis(), or am I doing something wrong?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In the future, you&#39;re going to have to do that in college exams and on the whiteboard in job interviews.  </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>As most people have already said, you don&#39;t need a coding portfolio. Most of the work you do is on company time, so the work belongs to the company. Additionally, assuming you&#39;re working on things under NDA you can&#39;t really name-drop.</p>

<p>A lot of people also mention GitHub as a job hunting tool. It <em>can</em> be useful, but you need to realise that an open source project you&#39;ve built yourself is absolutely no indicator that you will work well in a company, or can apply those skills to the kind of work a potential employer is looking for. Anyone who has been programming for a few years knows of a programmer they have worked with that writes code constantly, has a number of public repos of their own work, possibly even presents to other developers at user groups, but really wasn&#39;t that good at being a professional developer.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Senior Developer, and for me my professional experience speaks for itself.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Portfolio?  There&#39;s a portfolio of clients, maybe and a list of skills.  That&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>My friend works in OSS though and he links people his GitHub.  He&#39;s prolific and is in the AUTHORS files of sockets.io and Node.js, so he doesn&#39;t have much trouble finding work.</p>

<p>Totally different type of beast though.  Basically works where he wants, when he wants.</p>

<p>... ;)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m more on the embedded side and I have never heard of anyone asking for a GitHub apart from on Reddit. I am senior and all they ever ask for is a resume after they find me on LinkedIn or something like that. </p>

<p>Generally the resume just indicates what you have done with the keywords they are looking for. You don&#39;t really go into details until the interview. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In response to the edit, what exactly is preventing you from adding them? Normal float addition should work</p>

<pre><code>0.5 + 0.5 // would == 1.0, also a float
</code></pre>

<p>If you mean more akin to how to get them all added together, you&#39;re looking for some form of loop. A for loop would do fine in this case.</p>

<pre><code>sumOfFloats = 0 // Where we&#39;ll store our running total
listOfFloats = [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25]
for singleFloat in listOfFloats:
  sumOfFloats += singleFloat
print(sumOfFloats) // Should return 1.0 in this case
</code></pre>

<p>Now, if this is actual news to you, you might want to start going back over the basics of Python, as this is fairly rudimentary stuff. If it&#39;s just that you were getting a bit stuck, maybe take a break and come back, or you could still go back over some of the basics to help reinforce them. Hell, I had to double check my syntax on that for loop, been too long since I&#39;ve used Python.</p>

<p>BTW, this <em>is</em> in Python 3, if you&#39;re using 2.7, I don&#39;t recall what syntax changes there were, except that print needs parens now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is probably controversial advice, but if you want to build on your new C++ knowledge, you could try to write some CGI programs, i.e. C++ programs that handle the server side of a web page - parameter parsing, doing something with a posted form etc. This are general web/HTTP concepts which will apply to any other web technology you&#39;ll eventually touch in the future. Here&#39;s a tutorial: <a href="http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_web_programming.htm">http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cplusplus/cpp_web_programming.htm</a></p>

<p>Now, why do I say controversial? CGI is a very old standard, nobody is using it directly anymore, even less with C++, and chances are that you&#39;ll write some code that is exploitable by hackers. So please don&#39;t build a real website with it. Still it might be cool for you, because it builds on stuff you just learned.</p>

<p>The problem with web development is that it is a huge field, and most websites use a huge array of technology and languages that give every newcomer a headache. To look into stuff that&#39;s actually used today, you will need Javascript - it&#39;s the only language available in every browser for client side development, and modern websites use a lot of it (Web 2.0, Rich Client stuff and what not). Also there&#39;s no way around knowing HTML and CSS, but these are not programming languages in the strict sense.</p>

<p>On the server side, there is a lot more choice since you can use whatever you like to send HTML to the browser. Nowadays we typically use complex frameworks that abstract and simplify all the stuff shown in the C++ tutorial (and then some). Reasonable choices for today are e.g. Node.js (server-side Javascript), Python with Flask or Ruby on Rails. Don&#39;t worry too much about what to chose, it will be outdated in six months anyways. But whatever you learn, some of it will transfer to the next framework of the week.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This guy&#39;s being downvoted, but if you live in the industry for a while, you see the difference between people who have good CS degrees people who don&#39;t.</p>

<p>The people who went far in computer science love computation and big problems.  These problems can be on systems of any kind, involve any programming paradigms or languages, be hardware or software-related, intense data analysis or even AI.</p>

<p>The second group are forever stuck in the realm of &quot;business programming&quot;, MVV*, and OOP.  This is interesting and really useful, but some days you look outside you window and wonder about the kind of jobs you could get if only you had a degree.  Jobs in AI, self-driving cars, rocket propulsion, environmental analysis, finance, distributed computing on super computers, simulations of nuclear fusion, etc.</p>

<p>You know all of those tools that us we use on a daily basis?  Tools like servers, resource caches, network protocols, GPS devices, or even operating system?  Yeah, people wrote those.</p>

<p>So I highly, highly recommend a CS degree, but I do realize the idea of building stuff and &quot;scaling up&quot; to &quot;architecture&quot; rather than &quot;zoning in&quot; on details may seem more fun :)</p>

<p>Just keep this in mind:  The web is <em>awesome</em>, it really is, but I think one of the reasons it&#39;s so attractive also is that it has a relatively low barrier to entry.  There&#39;s a lot of things going on &quot;behind the scenes&quot; - web architecture or not - that are interesting in software engineering and CS.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Not considered senior developer yet, but I have 5 years experience in the industry, eventually let the portfolio go as it wasn&#39;t worth the time off hours maintaining. Client work can&#39;t be shared publicly due to NDA agreements. I simply list my clients, describe my role, and expect in depth conversations at interviews about programming, it eventually becomes more about your experience and references. The interviews will usually bring in one of their best dev&#39;s that do something similar to talk programming with you to validate skills that you claim.</p>

<p>For students: You need full gitpub portfolio&#39;s to supplement your lack of experience, this is largely so that a potential employer can see your code. Many people fluff their skills, no work experience is a gamble and you need to back yourself up with a pretty paper and code examples.</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>If the constructor generates the random numbers for a, b, and c, would next() use those variables as parameters to receive the information?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>next()</code>doesn&#39;t take any parameters and it doesn&#39;t need to. All of your methods inside of the <code>MathGenerator</code> class have implicit access to all of the fields. For example, in your <code>next</code> method if you reference some variable <code>a</code>, it&#39;ll be the field <code>a</code> that the constructor initialized. The exception is scoping - If you declare a variable named <code>a</code> at the top of <code>next</code>, it&#39;ll use that variable instead of the field. In that case, you can use <code>this.a</code> to access the field instead of the local variable.</p>

<p>EDIT: It looks like you should move what&#39;s in the constructor into your <code>next</code> method according to the instructions.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In turn, would getEquation() and getAnswer() also use a, b, and c as parameters since it needs the same information, or would it use something else that I would write into next()?</p>

<p>Answer to last question applies here too.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would the return type of next() be if it&#39;s just there to generate the equation, not solve or print it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>void</code>. Even if it were printing the equation, it would still be void. Just remember that if you&#39;re not returning anything, in other words, invoking the method only for some sort of side effect (Modifying variables, I/O, etc) that&#39;ll have a return type of <code>void</code>.</p>

<p>The biggest expense in software is maintenance.</p>

<p>Your experience, then, should not be entirely biased toward theory and architectures and patterns.  Those are important, but often in the way mathematical models can be - they model things under idael conditions and make a lot of assumptions.</p>

<p>One <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2tyed4/cs_what_do_you_need_to_know_really_broad_topics/">thread in particular</a> that I made was well-received and goes over the broad topics one should study to be successful in computer science.  It is very broad and may only add more questions to the OP&#39;s mix than answers.  I apologize for that, but I think it&#39;s worth skimming through anyways.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks, I will look at this later</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hey, thanks. That looks like a really solid approach.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Funnily enough yes. Gave up cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The constructor can generate the random numbers for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.  However, you need to re-generate new values for <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> any time <code>next()</code> is called, so you should probably put this logic in a helper function -- this allows you to re-use code (both the constructor and <code>next</code> can use this helper function).</p>

<p>So <code>next</code> would not use the current values of the variables; rather, it should assign new values to <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.</p>

<p>As you noted, <code>getEquation</code> and <code>getAnswer</code> should use the <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> values.  However, their method signatures do not take in <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> (so the user of this class would simply write <code>getEquation()</code> rather than <code>getEquation(1, 2, 3)</code>).</p>

<p>The return type of <code>next</code> is <code>void</code>, meaning it returns nothing.</p>

<p>It seems like you already got yourself an instance of <code>Random</code>, so your method of randomly generating <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> sounds fine.  It looks like the assignment also requires the operator (addition/subtraction/multiplication/division) to be generated randomly, which is slightly more complex than what you have.  Since you need one operator to be either multiplication or division, you could use <code>nextBoolean</code> (on <code>Random</code>) to decide whether you want multiplication or division.  Similarly for the addition/subtraction case.</p>

<p>As a matter of code design, <code>d</code> can be computed from the other variables.  When you decide to compute <code>d</code> is a design decision -- one good way to handle this is to compute <code>d</code> at the same time you modify <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code>.  (This is in contrast to the alternate approach where you compute <code>d</code> only in the <code>getAnswer</code> function, which is not ideal because then you have to do this computation anytime <code>getAnswer</code> is called, so the code <code>getAnswer();getAnswer();getAnswer();</code> would make your class do 3 times more work than necessary.)</p>

<p>If the constructor generates the random numbers for a, b, and c, would next() use those variables as parameters to receive the information?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well, next has no parameters as per the instructions for your assignment, so no. Similarly...</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In turn, would getEquation() and getAnswer() also use a, b, and c as parameters since it needs the same information, or would it use something else that I would write into next()?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, they&#39;re both parameterless. They all use the instance variables a, b, and c... but not as parameters. (Next sets a, b, and c (as well as the operands but you haven&#39;t done that yet), and the two get functions gets them).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What would the return type of next() be if it&#39;s just there to generate the equation, not solve or print it? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can just be void. Alternatively (though this is probably NOT what your professor wants you to do), next could return a new MathGenerator object that has a new equation, thereby allowing your variables to be immutable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Would I set up something like (d = a * b + c) only with random operands and operators inside of next() and then pass d on to getAnswer() and the rest into getEquation?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I don&#39;t understand this. In my opinion, you should randomly generate a, b, and c using ints, then generate the two operands, and all five variables are instance variables. Both get methods will have to parse what the equation means, and then just generate the string or the answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What function would I use to randomize the operators as well as the numbers?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s the next function you have to write (and you should probably just call next in your constructor to avoid duplicating code). You just basically have to do a coin flip, and if it&#39;s heads it&#39;s one operator, and if it&#39;s tails it&#39;s the other operator (do this twice). Then save that state.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Would you <a href="/u/Soleares">/u/Soleares</a> or <a href="/u/thereisnocatlevel">/u/thereisnocatlevel</a> be interested in either Microsoft&#39;s ASP.NET MVC ecosystem or the MEAN stack?</p>

<p>It is incredibly easy to get started with either of them.</p>

<p>For ASP.NET MVC, Microsoft offers a free course, but you may need to visit the &quot;getting started&quot; areas first:  <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc">http://www.asp.net/mvc</a>  and <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/pluralsight">www.asp.net/mvc/pluralsight</a></p>

<p>Node.js, you can probably just install and follow the basic tutorial, then look for some online tutorials on the MEAN stack (Mongo, Express, Angular, Node) to get an idea of what an N-tier application would look like.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what each offers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Ability to self-host a web server <em>easily</em>.  ASP.NET through OWIN / Katana, Node.js through its default architecture.</p></li>
<li><p>Full web stacks.  Mechanisms for UI, Scaffolding (templates), Server / Routing, ORM, Caching, DB storage, CRUD, security, authentication, etc. are available as part of the stacks or their &quot;ecosystems&quot; (base technology + tools commonly used with the stacks).</p></li>
<li><p>Command-line support for automation.  (ASP.NET is not as integrated with this yet, but the vNext - the full OSS version coming out soon - is.)</p></li>
<li><p>Integration with popular technologies like Boostrap, Angular, SQL Server or MongoDB, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Ability to deploy to the &quot;cloud&quot; / virtual environments and scale.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Which one you pick doesn&#39;t really matter, they&#39;re all money makers and will teach you about program architecture.  Just one is Windows, one is Cross-Platform (but I&#39;d say major OSS projects tend to be biased toward Unix-type systems).</p>

<hr/>

<p>There&#39;s also Ruby on Rails, and if you want to stick with professors who talk about Design Patterns and Architecture a bit, you&#39;ll get exposure to deploying to VMs through this course on RoR and Software as a Service:  <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x#.VQS7kvzF_gI">https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x#.VQS7kvzF_gI</a></p>

<p>This is all WEB-based though.  That&#39;s where nearly all of my experience lies.  Just note that with the ability to self-host applications, creating local &quot;web services&quot; that pass messages over ports on localhost is becoming increasingly common / easy to do.</p>
