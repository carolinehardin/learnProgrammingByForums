<div class="md"><p>For the past 10 months I&#39;m slowly developing a Java application that tracks down tv shows,downloads episodes from various torrent sites,renames the episodes,moves them to the correct directory and downloads proper english subtitles. It helped me improve my Java skills and learnt a lot about GUI creation. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/WUN2a">Here&#39;s an album of pictures of the gui since I started.</a></p>

<p>Edit: Went ahead and uploaded a java application capable of renaming files downloaded from torrent sites (exported some of the code of this application and added a simple gui) .<a href="https://github.com/StratosKam/SimpleRenamer">Here&#39;s the source code in case anyone is interested.</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve created a few things that I&#39;m pretty proud of at this point:</p>

<hr/>

<h2><strong>My Current Project:</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://lavancier.com/brockCharts/flashcards/flashcards.html">Here&#39;s a fuzzy match algorithm</a>.</p>

<p>Basically there&#39;s an answer key, and it checks if your answer contains similar thoughts to the actual answer and will mark you correct. It also fuzzy matches spelling so if you don&#39;t know how to spell &quot;infrared&quot; and spell it &quot;infared&quot;, it will still verify as true. The cool thing is that in the sentences spelling only matters to the extent of being close, and syntax doesn&#39;t matter at all!</p>

<p>Go ahead and write in any order! For example for the question &quot;Name Kanye&#39;s Comeback Album after 808&#39;s and Heartbreak&quot;, the following (and way more combinations and misspellings are successful):</p>

<p><code>&quot;my beautiful dark twisted fantasy&quot;</code></p>

<p><code>&quot;my dark beautiful twisted fantasy&quot;</code></p>

<p><code>&quot;my dark beautiul twisted fantasy&quot;</code></p>

<p><code>&quot;myy beautful dirk twised fantsy&quot;</code></p>

<p><code>&quot;The album was My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy by Kanye West&quot;</code></p>

<p><code>&quot; The al!!..bum wa-s My Be&#39;au0tifu55l Dawrk Twis&quot;&quot;ted Fasn----tasy by Kannye West&quot;</code></p>

<p>but of course <code>&quot;The College Dropout&quot;</code> registers at 0% accuracy.</p>

<p>It&#39;s useful for checking if the user is right even though they may have a different syntax or a messed up spelling. We don&#39;t all formulate ideas in the same way, let alone write them the same. You shouldn&#39;t ever be marked wrong because your syntax is different though, and that&#39;s why fuzzy match is awesome.</p>

<p>I programmed everything in Javascript in about 8 hours of programming -- most of it was experimenting with different ratios and methods of formatting data.</p>

<hr/>

<h2><strong>My Long-Term Project:</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://lavancier.com/research-data-beta.php?interval=900&amp;ticker=MCD&amp;period=21&amp;bollbands=bollingerbands">Here&#39;s a ticker research page</a>. </p>

<p>This one lets you query any asset or equity. If you click on the background it changes between line charts and histograms, and you can check out things like skewness, kurtosis, and volatility over time which you really can&#39;t see at any other site for free.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also an RSS feed on the side that pops out when you scroll all the way to the left. You can also click &quot;show statistics&quot;, which blurs out the graphs and shows the fundamentals and technicals for the company. </p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty proud of the design on the site so far.</p>

<p>This one is a mix of JS and PHP. I fetch the data with PHP and format and output with JS. This has been a labor of love for months. It has been a project that I&#39;ve worked on since November, but has taken so many forms. I&#39;ve redone the page dozens of times.</p>

<p>The older page for instance is <a href="http://lavancier.com/research-data.php">here</a>, but if you submit a query it can take up to a full minute to process. Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that. The reason why was because I was loading 13 different highcharts with up to 15,000 points on each. So what I did instead is come up with my own charting API, redid the whole site from the ground up, and the above is the result. :)</p>

<p>For kicks, <a href="http://lavancier.com/marketanalysis/stock-data.php">this was the original</a> page from back in November. As you can see it has come pretty far..</p>

<hr/>

<p><a href="http://lavancier.com/travel.php">Here I created a basic travel site.</a></p>

<p>You can type in airports to depart and arrive at, search, and it pulls up a list of flights and their costs. You can also switch between checking out maps and taking notes that you can save in a server.</p>

<p>This was done using JS and PHP along with access to the QPX Travel API.</p>

<hr/>

<h2><strong>My API:</strong></h2>

<p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/brockwhittaker/nyzx3of0/3/">I created my own charting API.</a></p>

<p>I did some testing and realized that both Google Charts and HighCharts loaded extremely slow with lots of data so I built my own charting API using canvas elements that is less than 20kb. It is interactive with jQuery and it loads 6x faster (by latest measurement). You can change the setInterval to the fastest (0), and it&#39;ll generate charts at well over 60fps. You can also easily chart up to 1,000,000 points with volume included and it&#39;ll load in less than a few seconds whereas I wasn&#39;t even capable with HighCharts.</p>

<p>I also integrated the volume into the chart so that you don&#39;t have to reference two separate charts. :)</p>

<hr/>

<p>And lastly, <a href="http://lavancier.com/brockCharts/SimulateTheMarket.php?standard-deviation=1.50&amp;mean-increase=0.02&amp;skewness=-0.50&amp;speed=fast">here&#39;s a simulation</a> that takes a user-specified volatility, skewness, and drift and generates a random path for that asset. It implements the typical random walk with monte carlo simulations, but the cool part is that you can control the skewness of the asset. It can be useful in visualizing the different directions and paths that an asset can take over time.</p>

<p>This was done using a box-muller transformation and then standard transformations to create a skewness. The charts used here are one of my older versions.. I haven&#39;t gotten around to updating it.</p>

<p>All done in JS. Only PHP to collect from input, but I&#39;m changing that to JS soon.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A few weeks ago I created a Minesweeper solver in C#. You simply load up an instance of Minesweeper, run the program, and it reads the game board into a matrix where it the calculates the most efficient move and then clicks a square. Rince and repeat. I&#39;ve gotten it to beat intermediate difficulty in 2 seconds, but it&#39;s still being improved.</p>

<p>The jist of how moves are calculated is that it makes as many no risk moves as it can as quickly as possible. When it gets to the point that it cannot make a 100% safe move, it calculates the next safest move by running a monte carlo-esque algorithm to generate a random sampling of potential mines on the game board with respect to adjacent numbers, such that only valid assortments of mine are considered.</p>

<p>It works well and has helped me improve my own playing strategy when I see it make moves that I never thought were logical in the past.</p>
</div><div class="md"><h1><a href="https://i.imgur.com/xzT3nDk.png">I make games!</a></h1>

<p>About three years ago I began teaching myself <strong>Python and Pygame</strong>, my first programming experience. After a few tiny projects that were extremely bug ridden, I set off creating a massive RTS in Python. As fun as it was at first, the project soon became bloated and there was no end in sight. </p>

<p>So, in the summer of last year I decided to shed the burden, consign <a href="https://github.com/jellyberg/Aedificus---Fathers_of_Rome">my RTS</a> to the dustbin of GitHub (feel free to fork!) and work on some <strong>smaller projects, focusing on fun rather than features</strong>. </p>

<p>Within a week or so I finished <a href="http://jellyberg.itch.io/juggleball"><strong>Juggleball</strong> (Windows exe)</a>. <strong>Felt amazing to finish a game</strong>!</p>

<p>After a few months I created <a href="http://jellyberg.itch.io/londons-burning"><strong>London&#39;s Burning!</strong> (Windows exe)</a>, another smaller game. Great fun to work on. </p>

<p>Here I began to stray back into the dangerous territory of overscoping projects. After failed attempts at a Binding of Isaac style medic game, a platformer and a shmup, I decided I needed to return to making smaller tighter games. </p>

<p>I taught myself <strong>C#</strong> (with relative ease) and picked up the popular 3d engine <strong>Unity</strong>. It&#39;s really nice to work with allowing some great graphical effects even with minimal art. </p>

<p><a href="http://jellyberg.itch.io/pong"><strong>Ping</strong> (playable in browser or downloadable for Windows, Mac and Linux)</a> is the fruit of my efforts! I&#39;ve audio created an iOS port which is currently awaiting review. </p>

<p><strong><em>TL;DR</em></strong>: <strong>I make games, play them for free</strong> <a href="http://jellyberg.itch.io"><strong>here</strong></a>. </p>

<h1>Employment</h1>

<p>Over the summer I was commissioned by my uncle&#39;s business to create an in house data entry app for iPad. This was a massive learning experience for me as I had never used Objective-C before, nor developed for iOS. I learnt a lot and would be confident to create more apps in the future. </p>

<hr/>

<h1>Summary</h1>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Programming for three years</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finished 4 games</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Started countless unfinished projects</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Made one app</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Wrote tens of thousands of lines of code</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bashed my head against the wall hundreds of times</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Had a bloody brilliant time</strong></p></li>
</ul>
</div><div class="md"><p><em>Disclaimer: I was already proficient in the language.</em></p>

<p>My latest and and to date largest project was an assignment to create a simple (space- and time-constrained) AI for Nine Men&#39;s Morris. I went way overboard and decided to use a neural network. For that I needed to solve the whole game first, so that the NN could train against a perfect player. AFAIK, I&#39;m actually the first person to have solved this particular variant of NMM, in which closing one/two mills allows you to take any one/two stones of the opponent. It&#39;s a draw, just like the other variants.</p>

<p>It took me about ~350h in total to get everything done in C++.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>My music app and how I learnt to code (appreciate your feed back in <a href="/r/rails">/r/rails</a> , very helpful, hopefully I&#39;ll get some more here ):

</div><div class="md"><p>My favorite project that was somewhat original was that I downloaded my facebook profile and created a program in VBA that asked me what converrsation I wanted to analyze. It found that message stream and counted how many messages were sent back and forth over time. It could go by months, days, or years. Then once it had all the data it shoved everything into and excel file and made some graphs. So it had like a bar graph of which person in each conversation made the most comments.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/3PHJv3K.png">Here is a comparison</a> of how many messages I was sent by my first girlfriend compared to my second (current) girlfriend sent. Usually the labels would be there names but I just changed that. 1st girlfriend and I got together September. Then we broke up after like 3 weeks. 2nd girlfriend and I got to gether in December. February 2013 I got a cell phone that had unlimited texting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s always super fun to see life events correlated with numbers and data. I&#39;ve done this with other friends too. </p>

<p>Anyway it didn&#39;t take much time for the education level to learn this project, just learn how to go word for word through a file, and recognize certain strings as being important. The exporting to excel stuff I just copied from the tutorials and modified some stuff. I now understand dhow those things actually work, but that&#39;s not really important for just using them. I&#39;d say anyone could make something like this with less than a few months of experience.</p>

<p>I&#39;d share the code but I made it almost 2 years ago and it&#39;s completely illegible. If anyone cares though just ask.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Made a small app in Java that can parse information from an EVE account and analyze your ISK/hour from fleet activities.</p>

<p>Worked with Ruby on Rails to extend and modify a GitLab server to make it more usable in an education model.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been writing a chess engine.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve just finished writing the minimax search that can search to any depth (previously it was limited to a depth-2 search).</p>

<p>Right now I&#39;m trying to implement alpha-beta pruning which will make the search a lot more efficient and should allow me to go a lot deeper than it currently does.</p>

<p>Right now it only searches to depth 2 as a depth 3 search takes about 8 seconds per move (compared to 0.5 seconds per move on the depth 2 search).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=guKlHxhgoFQ&amp;feature=youtu.be">Here&#39;s a video of me playing against it.</a></p>

</div><div class="md"><p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=creepy.steve.tbsp1_3b&amp;hl=en">Text-based Strip Poker</a></p>

<p>Since it is an Android app, Java and XML was the most sensible languages to use. This was my first (and, so far, only) project written in Java. I wanted to learn the language and I felt doing some artificial intelligence would be perfect.</p>

<p>It took me about 6 months to complete, but I was unemployed at the time so I got to learn at my own speed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Evolutionary algorithm to generate melodies using a &quot;Kill Keep Breed&quot; interface. Took me about two months to get it working from the first line of code, but I planned it on and off for about four. I used Supercollider. I was learning as I went along, and started with next to no knowledge of the language.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Started Android Development in october &#39;14, I published Rockett <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.ludovicbonivert.rockett">link</a> on the play store a few weeks ago. Man, I learned so much ! I had already +/- 2 years of Java programming, but the Android SDK has a lot of new things to offer and I spend the first few months writing simple GUI apps or JSON fetching from a webservice. </p>

<p>Like most of the side projects, it all started with a daily problem. Mine was that I couldn&#39;t find a solid productivity tracker. So... I made my own. You can create and put notes to timer. Those timers can be retrieved on your local profile. </p>

<p>There is no right time for starting a side project. You will ALWAYS feel like there is something new to learn before starting your personal project. Just go for it ! At the end, you will be happy finally doing a project that you love and that is useful for you/others. What helped me a lot in staying motivated is breaking the whole app/problems into small todo&#39;s. Everyday I could say to myself ; &quot;Yeaah ! I achieved 3 todo&#39;s today&quot; </p>

<p>Those little milestones helped me keeping myself each day further and I&#39;m still updating this, while doing my next side project. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made a web app that manages RPG character sheets. I&#39;m rather proud of it, took me a year and a half to get it where it is, but it was functional within a month or two.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been programming in python for a couple years, and recently I got an itch to learn more about how programming languages are implemented. I ended up reading the great post <a href="http://norvig.com/lispy.html">(How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python))</a> and it inspired me to rewrite his <code>lis.py</code> interpreter into ruby. <a href="https://github.com/djds23/lirb">You can take at the source here</a>. I tinkered on it for a couple hours a night over a few days, and all in all I am very pleased with the results. Take a peak! Let me know what you think!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been working on a <a href="http://www.co-funded.com">crowdfunded feedback system</a> project for a few years along side my real job (which is also programming) and I finally launched it a couple of weeks ago. It&#39;s PHP/jQuery/MySQL based and I feel like I am still learning things every day. Even though it&#39;s now launched, I think it will be a few more weeks of real usage by people I don&#39;t know before I have full confidence in it!</p>

<p>I have always been the type of person that will create things confidently, even without enough knowledge of a system. The confidence is not so much based on believing I have the skills in the first place, but more in believing that I will be able overcome any problems I encounter.</p>

<p>I think that the hard part for me now lies ahead - it&#39;s my baby, which means I now have to learn about marketing, something very much outside my current skillset!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Last summer I started learning HTML, CSS, PHP and MySql and I started this project: <a href="http://www.shortcutsheaven.com">www.shortcutsheaven.com</a></p>

<p>It&#39;s a search engine for shortcuts and I learnt a lot with it. I am still a beginner in web programming but now I know a lot more about how database work. I&#39;m sure my code is horrible and any real programmer out there would have a stroke by looking at it but I learnt a lot by having to solve problems for this particular project.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sadly, I&#39;ve only really created one thing. I&#39;m studying Irish and I always found myself getting distracted by opening a web-browser to go to a dictionary website. So I created an app that allows me to search it from the desktop, without opening a browser. There&#39;s an English and an Irish version of it, so you can do it with whichever language you like. On the Irish version, everything except the entries themselves are in Irish (They&#39;re not on the website). It gives you all information, such as similar words, if it&#39;s a possible, grammatical form of another word, etc. Furthermore, it also downloads the audio for the word, if it exists, and allows you to play it in any of the three main dialects. </p>

<p>Sadly, I don&#39;t know what other features I could implement, except maybe a save file as it currently doesn&#39;t remember which language you last used it in. Any ideas for expansion or another project would be welcomed!</p>

<p>Oh: I did it all in Python with PyQt5 and BeautifulSoup.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I created the iOS app airhoot. It took me 9 months. I knew zero objective c when I started. It&#39;s an anonymous encrypted social network similar to the likes of whisper and yikak. The difference is you can doodle or doodle on photos. You can also doodle on other people&#39;s photos. It&#39;s created a pretty fun environment and the way people use re doodles has been pretty entertaining to say the least. </p>

<p>I&#39;m currently writing the android version. Also learning Java from scratch to write it. I&#39;m hoping to use the app as a portfolio piece to obtain a full time development job. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="https://ivosklenar.net/Projects/NTree">NTree</a> - .NET library that provides implementation of tree based data structures.

<p>Edit: come on guys, you crashed my server. Deleting the link for now. If you have the page open, please close it so that the page can come back up.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>My first &#39;big&#39; project started out as a report request. My primary job isn&#39;t programming, but application support. The main application I support is a permit tracking system for a city. This application is a good application, but sometimes getting information from it can be tedious. One day I received a request for a report where they can type an address in and see absolutely everything about that address, including all parcel/owner information, all permits pulled, the contractors that pulled the permit, how the workflow for the permit went, a whole bunch of custom fields (most of which were stored in the database as an EAV model), and various activities.</p>

<p>I took one look at this request and immediately thought &quot;This is way too much for a report&quot;. So, over the course of a year I put all of my accumulated VB.NET experience to work at building an application to fill this request. This was going to be my first big, and very public, project, and I wanted to get everything right while creating it. </p>

<p>Over the course of building the application, I learned many new things, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>data binding</p></li>
<li><p>how to interact with databases</p></li>
<li><p>how to handle an EAV model</p></li>
<li><p>parameterized queries</p></li>
<li><p>adding components to a form during runtime</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The end result was an application that filled all of their needs, and more. After you start it, you are prompted for an address to search for. As you type the address, beginning on the second character you will be shown a list of results that match what you have typed. As you keep typing, the results narrow down further. Once you have selected an address from the list, it creates a &#39;selected address&#39; object, which is populated via a long string of queries to the database. Once the data population is complete, the object is used to populate (and in some some cases create) fields on the screen. Most of that was done through object binding, but some of it (mainly the EAV stuff) didn&#39;t play well with binding and had to be updated manually.</p>

<p>The user knows none of that, though. All they see is a brief &#39;Loading&#39; message, and then the data is displayed. At that point, they can browse through it using a system of tabbed pages. Some of the information is displayed in simple text fields, while other bits are used to fill DGVs. In most cases where there is a DGV, the user can double-click on a row to pop up a small form showing them more information about that particular record. The permitting application has a simple document management system built into it, so I also figured out how to allow the user to see what documents are attached as well as download them locally for viewing.</p>

<p>All-in-all, it was well-received, and I&#39;m very proud of it. It was a great learning experience. I might post some screenshots later, if there&#39;s interest in it.</p>

<p>Bonus: This project also made me create a line of code that makes me cringe everytime I look at it:</p>

<pre><code>CType(tcAddrAttributes.TabPages.Item(tcAddrAttributes.TabPages.IndexOfKey(attr.Template)).Controls.Item(tcAddrAttributes.TabPages.Item(tcAddrAttributes.TabPages.IndexOfKey(attr.Template)).Controls.IndexOfKey(attr.Template)), DataGridView).Rows.Add(str)
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve made a Raspberry Pi GUI to take timelapses by taking photos at a defined interval for a set amount of time. The photos are then sewed up into a gif and deleted. There&#39;s a timelapse command you can issue to a RasPi, but we were fairly low on storage at the time so we couldn&#39;t store a bunch of .mp4s.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been doing pretty small stuff so far, but I&#39;m pretty proud of my RedditSnapper program. Takes the top 10 jpegs from a subreddit of your choice and adds them to a Snapchat bot&#39;s story. Super quick way to get your daily <a href="/r/funny">/r/funny</a> dose or whatever. Unfortunately Snapchat is doing as much as they can to stop 3rd party API access, so it might not work for long.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I built a mobile shopping app called <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/id917126419">Denarri</a>. </p>

<p>Originally, I had the concept/design down and went around to meetups trying to find that &quot;unicorn programmer&quot; that was both talented and equally passionate about Denarri. As I&#39;m sure many of you can guess, that didn&#39;t go very far, so I said screw it, I&#39;ll build it myself! Without any prior programming experience (barring some Codecademy HTML/CSS lessons), I went through Apple&#39;s Objective-C tutorial to learn the syntax, then started building. </p>

<p>As I built the app, I realized that there needed to be some sort of backend that does the behind the scenes work, which panicked me a bit because I knew that would be a huge undertaking. Luckily, I found 
<a href="https://www.parse.com">Parse</a>, which saved me a ton of time, since all I needed to do was use JavaScript to customize the framework to my needs. </p>

<p>6 months and a shitton of long nights later, I launched in the app store, and it&#39;s been growing ever since. Also, <a href="https://www.stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a> is a life saver. The super helpful community there got me through so many roadblocks in my code. </p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;m so glad that I made the decision to build it myself, because I feel like I have a superpower now with so much potential. :)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve only been using it on my system with Python 3.4 and Ubuntu 14.04, so that&#39;s all that it&#39;s compatible with at the moment. However all I think that needs to be changed for other systems is the file location and command that sets the wallpaper. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m currently working on an <a href="https://github.com/ForSpareParts/irc-client/">IRC client implementation in Javascript</a>. It&#39;s designed to run as a service, then you connect to it from a web browser to chat, so that you can be constantly connected to your servers and logging messages, even if you&#39;re not there. It&#39;s still very early, but it can currently:</p>

<ul>
<li>Configure/remember an IRC server configuration along with your nick.</li>
<li>Connect to/disconnect from IRC servers.</li>
<li>Join channels</li>
<li>See incoming messages from channels</li>

<p>All the actual logic is in Javascript, but as a web project it required a bit of HTML and CSS as well. I had a working knowledge of all three before I started, so it&#39;s hard to estimate how much time it took to learn, but my understanding of Javascript has increased greatly since the start of this project.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve been programming on and off for about a year and half now, made these 2 simple games and webpages for school projects:

</div><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re not concerned with programming everything yourself so much, Unreal might be the way to go if you&#39;re creating a shooter, horror game, or something else that remains around those types. The Blueprints system is really intuitive and very nice to work with, and there are plenty of tutorials out there.</p>

<p>Unity is definitely more suited toward a smaller, more independent development team, even just one person, but it comes at the cost of visuals, which Unreal takes without competition. Unity is usually easier to use however, as you can use a variety of languages. Plus you&#39;ve got an advantage in being able to deploy your game into a web player, so you don&#39;t need to download an executable to play it. The Unity community and Asset Store are also far more active and populated than UE4.</p>

<p>As <a href="/u/nitehawk39">/u/nitehawk39</a> said, just try them both and see which one you&#39;d prefer more. Try making a simple game of Pong in both, or a side-scroller.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You may want to X-post with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/">/r/gamedev</a> for this.</p>

<p>I honestly think you should get both engines, they are both free for initial use anyway, and both have their own perks.
For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unity targets many platforms, so you can deploy your game almost everywhere.</li>
<li>Unreal Engine allows better control over your application, as source code is provided.</li>
</ul>

<p>Play around with both and see which one suits your tastes/workflow/knowledge better.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Since they are now free, just try both. Only then will you know what you like to work with.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Unity has C#, which in my opinion is an incredible language. Very similar to Java. The editor in Unity is also very nice. But one thing I learned today about Unity 5 is that they collect data from people playing your game. I don&#39;t know what your concerns on privacy is, but I personally don&#39;t like that very much.</p>

<p>Unreal has bar none the sexiest rendering engine of the two. It uses C++ and has Blueprints, which to my knowledge is not really programming. </p>

<p>Personally I would recommend Unreal if you want to make games in the future. C++ will not be dying anytime soon as the industry standard for games. Do Unity if you want to make desktop applications at some point. C# is a great language for program dev.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Unreal Engine, in my opinion, is more beneficial to game programmers. I&#39;ve tried both and I have to admit <strong>if you haven&#39;t programmed in C++</strong> then I would go with Unity just because c# and javascript is really easy to learn/develop if you have any prior high level language experience. Other than the language barrier Unreal has I can&#39;t think of a reason not to go with Unreal. There is a misinformed populace that believes that you can only build first person shooters with unreal and that can&#39;t be further from the truth. I&#39;ve worked with small to medium sized unreal projects and have yet to be limited by &quot;shooter bias&quot;, if there are any. Blueprints are great for learning the api and for quick prototyping and altough it is &quot;visual scripting&quot; the similarities to another programming language is not that different. I believe people who claim it is &quot;not real programming language&quot; don&#39;t know  what the purpose of a programming language is. You still have to solve the same problems and create algorithms that would be exactly the same as in a high level programming language( you can literally give a blueprint to any semi-competent programmer and should be able to easily convert to <strong>any</strong> language). </p>

<p>To be honest though after a month or so of blueprinting I rarely touch it and stick to the c++ unless I need to know more about a method and how it should work(auto fill method names and context linking is beyond great and should be a part of any api).</p>

<p>Even if you don&#39;t know c++ it is still very helpful to try to learn c++ and an engine at the same time because most game engines are in C++ so it helps beyond just specific game engines like unity(c#/javascript). </p>

<p>If I come off as bias towards UE4 its because I am. Tried both ue4 was easier for me to start immediately, beautiful graphics keep me motivated, ease of use, quick prototyping and the benefits of knowing c++ for future game engines leaves me wondering why anyone would chose unity instead.(besides the language barrier which if you don&#39;t know c++ is very real)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Go with unity until you know what you&#39;re doing.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re new to the whole thing then Unity the way to go. Unity is an entire environment for building, whereas UE is largely code-based.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Traditionally this can be done with push notifications.  Basically, the browser client is holding open a connection and waiting for a response to see how the state has changed.</p>

<p>A newer option is something called web sockets.  It accomplishes the same thing, but you don&#39;t have to hold open an http connection, since it wasn&#39;t really designed for this.</p>

<p>A really newer option is to look at what HTTP/2 supports.  I believe it has some functionality for what you&#39;re looking for but I&#39;m not even sure if any web servers support it yet.</p>

<p>Super simple with a few lines of whatever language you&#39;re &#39;comfortable&#39; with... Make an html page that refreshes every few seconds and the server side script just sends the page with the new count, maybe kept in cache or a txt file. It won&#39;t be real two way communications, but if you can&#39;t do this, doing it properly is a few layers of learning away. </p>

<p>Also, are there any open source browsers written in c++ out there?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure - Mozilla Firefox is 100% open-source, and Google Chrome is 99% open-source - the open-source part is called Chromium. There&#39;s also WebKit, which is used in Safari and other browsers, it&#39;s not quite a complete browser but it contains a lot of the important code.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m not sure how helpful it would be to look at that code - they are each <em>tens of millions</em> of lines of C++ code, they&#39;re the product of tens of thousands of person-years of effort.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re really, really interested in learning how to write a browser, here&#39;s a great blog:</p>

<p><a href="http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html">http://limpet.net/mbrubeck/2014/08/08/toy-layout-engine-1.html</a></p>

<p>If you don&#39;t actually want to learn to send HTTP requests, parse HTML, and such, another option is to use an existing C++ class that provides you with an HTML rendering component, and then you can build just the UI around it, like the back/forward buttons, bookmarks, history, etc.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A very easy way is to use Qt (QWebView). <a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-4.8/webkit-fancybrowser.html">Here is an example</a></p>

A simple browser is really going to start with just parsing the HTML and rendering the text, and you might want to invoke the help of some text rendering/layout library.</p>

<p>People say to build something on your own but I have no idea what to build.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Think about all the tasks you&#39;re repeatedly doing on your computer. It could be anything. Checking if there are new threads on a subreddit with more than X votes. Checking if a Twitter account used a certain hashtag. Checking if there are new sales on Steam. Checking if there are new torrent uploads. Checking the latest updates in an online game. Checking the latest sports results. After you find such a task, write a program that does exactly that for you.</p>

<p>Once you build that, don&#39;t move to another project just yet. Instead, add some new features to your program. If there are new tweets with a certain hashtag, retweet them on your account. If there are new sales on Steam, calculate the value of the discount using savings and ratings and then present the results in a table. If there&#39;s a new torrent upload, download it. If an online game just got updated, send a text message to your phone.</p>

<p>Then, think how you could make your programs more flexible. For example, instead of hardcoding the Twitter account and the hashtag, make it so you can pass them as arguments in your function.</p>

<p>Writing something immediately useful to you is rewarding and enjoyable. Plus, you already know the intermediate steps of your task, so you have your program planned out for you. And you start with just a single, simple task, so you won&#39;t feel overwhelmed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Start looking into Algorithms and Data Structures. There are free classes on Coursera, Udacity, MIT OCW, etc. That&#39;s really the most important step to becoming a competent developer.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As someone who is also has the basics down, I started learning Object-Oriented Design on lynda.com. It is a great way to get  an understanding on program design.  I feel like it will help you manage those programs that may seem too difficult. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For me the next stop was writing a program that could remember things. Write a command line program that inventories something like books or movies. Have your program write items into a text file, read items from the file, add to it, remove, alter them. There are plenty of things to be learned from this exercise and its quite rewarding.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re done, create a mysql database and write a program that uses that instead of text files. Try to conceptualize a program that could use either text files or mysql with minimal modifications.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a million things you could do, but this exercise is incredibly useful and totally attainable for beginners. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Get a programming book for beginners. They&#39;re full of adequate assignments  (naturally).</p>

<li>microsoftvirtualacademy.com</li>
</ul>

<p>I would love to add more to this list, so please argue that I should add something. But these are the only ones I know of that will give you a nice URL to share with your completed courses on them. Of course there&#39;s no policing of cheating, but these are free and give you <em>something</em> in the form of public recognition of your efforts. If you do MIT OCW or something like that, you only have your own notes to show for your efforts. If you can make those look nice and put them on your website, then great, but that&#39;s not a trivial addition to the workload.</p>

<p>For your situation, I think the Microsoft Virtual Academy could serve you well. You can jump right into intermediate courses, and these courses are heavily focused on skills and software ecosystems demanded in business. If you&#39;re doing it for fun, there are several courses on game development extensions.</p>

<p>the way I went about it, I had two arrays to store the status of the cells, one which is being examined, and the other that stores the next iteration.

<p>You can chain as many logical operations as you want together in an if statement, they just need to be self contained. You need to check that dice1 and rolled dice1 are equal AND that dice2 and rolled dice2 are equal, two separate comparisons anded together for the full if condition.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You aren&#39;t checking if two integers are equal to two other integers, you are checking if the expression <code>input_dice1 &amp; input_dice2</code> is equal to the expression <code>diceRoll1.getDice1() &amp; diceRoll1.getDice2()</code>.

<p>To check if one thing is true and also another thing is true, you do</p>

<p>Basically, writing a program consists of creating some sort of text file that a human can read and understand.  This file then goes through the compiler, which translates it into a format the computer can use, producing the executable file.</p>

<p>Now, some languages skip the executable file, and the translation step also executes the instructions in the source file.  That&#39;s usually a characteristic of scripting languages.  Others translate to a format that&#39;s not quite ready for the computer to execute directly, sometimes called &quot;bytecode.&quot;  This format is sometimes be called an executable file, but I feel like that&#39;s a bad term.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would say it&#39;s a file that can be run directly by the operating system.</p>

<p>As a non-programmer computer user, this distinction from other types of files might be confusing.  In Windows, if you double-click almost any file, it will generally run... does that mean it&#39;s executable?  Not necessarily.  If the file is not natively executable, the OS looks at the file extension to see if there&#39;s a setting telling it which executable file to open first that can process the file.  If there is, it opens that program and passes it the name of the file so it can do whatever it&#39;s supposed to do with it.  If not, OS will just tell you it doesn&#39;t know what to do with your file.</p>

<p>You might want to look into a CSS preprocessor like <a href="http://lesscss.org/">LESS</a> or <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS/SCSS</a> to make your life easier.</p>

<p>You can just use a tool to do the conversion from less/sass to CSS like <a href="http://koala-app.com/">Koala</a> (I&#39;ve never used this but it looks pretty straightforward), or you can create an build process using something like <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a></p>

<p>You might also want to look into some sort of framework like <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to help get you started there&#39;s a bunch out there but it&#39;s one of the most popular and will get you started with grids and some other nice features. </p>

<p>I believe Less and Bootstrap are now tooled into visual studio so you can just use that to create your static sites as well. </p>

<p>I know, I know. Wordpress?! Hear me out:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You need a simple website. Wordpress gives you that plus a good theme gives you a bit more - like responsive design, and nice templates.  </p></li>
<li><p>You can literally have the site complete in a few hours.  </p></li>
<li><p>It adds value to the &quot;simple site&quot; by having a decently easy way to manage content.  </p></li>

<p>Just my two cents. You could also build a lightweight static website using sass/less/css and html if you wanted. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>In the case of an int, you aren&#39;t saving any memory or CPU time by passing by reference.  It makes the function harder to use, because you can&#39;t write things like <code>do_something(get_int() + 20);</code> or <code>int other = get_int() * 10;</code>.  So there is no justification whatsoever for doing that.</p>

<p>There are some cases where it makes sense, like when the type is not copyable, or when it only makes sense to already have an existing object that you want to mutate (e.g. a function that shuffles a vector.)  But those tend to be much rarer.  A function that is going to generate a value should almost always return the value.  Sometimes it&#39;s tempting to use &quot;out&quot; parameters if you want to return more than one value, but consider returning a tuple or pair in cases like that.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The only reason to use an output-only parameter (the case here) is if your function needs to return multiple things (it is cumbersome to write and use a function that returns multiple values). Once upon a time these were useful for returning classes that are expensive to copy (like vectors), but that is no longer necessary in c++11 with move semantics.</p>

<p>To answer your actual question, there are plenty of good reasons to pass-by-reference <em>in general</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Input/output parameters. If you need to read a parameter and then modify it, pass by reference is the best way to do this.</li>
<li>Passing read-only parameters that are expensive to copy. Things like arrays/vectors, it is expensive to pass them by value, so it is usually preferable to pass them by reference.</li>
<li>Passing parameters that are impossible to copy. You have to pass by reference if copy by value isn&#39;t allowed for the type in question.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are exceptions to these, especially with the introduction of move semantics, but those are good general guidelines. Also, see: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/QDq0Evd.png">http://i.imgur.com/QDq0Evd.png</a></p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t worry about running out of things to learn. As you learn you&#39;ll find new complementary material. For example, you&#39;re working with javascript and php. Every now and then you&#39;re doing some sort of research (i.e how do I make this do that) and you&#39;ll find that there&#39;s some helpful technology to make your life easier, so you go out and fiddle around with that. Rinse and repeat.</p>

<p>For me, I started with Django (a web framework). Simple static web pages, until I needed to make a complex web-app. I heard of Angular before and so began to explore and play with it. Made good progress, things were made quite a bit easier. I stumbled upon what it mean to have a restful app, began to learn Django Rest Framework and how to write good APIs.</p>

<p>tl;dr: Don&#39;t worry, learning propagates itself. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Find out what you really want. Do you want to be a web designer? Android dev? Game designer? Find one thing you really like and start focussing on that. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The advice I found most helpful to me was to seriously consider what I enjoyed doing the most. Even when you absolutely love what you do, sometimes you&#39;ll get a client and, for whatever reason, they&#39;re able to suck all the fun out of it almost instantly. This isn&#39;t always the case, but if you love what you do it&#39;ll be much less painful in those moments.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a web person myself so all of my advice really is geared towards that, I can&#39;t say much on animation, gaming, or any of those industries- it&#39;s possible they operate very differently. If you decide to take the web development route with your own business here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned while doing so.</p>

<p>As for the code side- find a framework and learn it up and down, that&#39;s your main area of focus. This can be any stack/framework you find working with to be fun and interesting, and most importantly, productive. Don&#39;t discredit other frameworks and languages! If you&#39;re a Ruby on Rails person you may have to set up a much more simple site, and maybe something like Flask is a better solution. Have lots of tools you can use and be open about new things, but it&#39;s okay to have your favorite hammer too.</p>

<p>The skill of learning how to solve a problem you didn&#39;t know before is the most valuable part of all of this. Many jobs you may take on will have elements you haven&#39;t done before, or that you&#39;re not sure how to approach but that&#39;s okay. Eventually you&#39;ll build confidence in that even if you don&#39;t know how to do it now, you can learn it and find a good solution.</p>

<p>The business side- this is more tricky for me as I&#39;m not a great business person. Find a business lawyer who can help you set up a company, and someone to help with taxes. Unless you know this stuff and enjoy it then go for it on your own, but personally I just get frustrated so I have people help on that side. When it comes to getting clients, I have found that starting locally and doing things in person is incredibly helpful. If you think you can help a company, business, restaurant, whatever, with their online stuff then try meeting in person and talking about it with the owner. Offer new solutions to problems they may have already. If someone owns a bunch of pizza restaurants in town but they&#39;re not a huge chain, maybe an online ordering system could be beneficial for them.</p>

<p>This has turned out to be a much longer reply than I had intended, but I guess in short; do what you love doing the most, keep working at it even after a bunch of rejection (rejection is going to happen), don&#39;t fall into knowing how to use just one framework or language, experience is the best teacher, and while there are lots of ways to fail, there are also just as many ways to be successful.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Languages get labeled as things like &quot;scalable&quot; due to evidence that they&#39;ve performed that way (or will perform that way) either some or all of the time.</p>

<p>Some labels are precise: for instance, Scala is labeled as strongly-typed, whereas PHP is labeled as weakly-typed. These labels characterize how strictly it will enforce the programmer&#39;s expectations. A strongly typed will require much more definition and upfront effort from the programmer, but in return, the language&#39;s compiler will enforce those definitions for the programmer automatically. A weakly typed language requires no such definitions, but consequently the compiler is unable to detect programming errors until that code is actually run. It is therefore useful to know whether a language is strongly typed or weakly typed, as it will significantly affect how you design and write programs.</p>

<p>Other labels, like scalable, are less clearly defined. A common definition is that a language is scalable if it&#39;s believed that both large and small programs can be written in it. Large programs have different concerns and problems than small programs. Language designers are aware of this, and they may try to design their language to remain useful for both large and small programs. If they succeed, then we perceive the language as scalable. Of course, some languages are not designed to be scalable and instead have a bias towards managing programs of a specific size or scale.</p>

<p>Beware that people may overgeneralize and say that &quot;X language is not scalable&quot; when they actually mean &quot;The Y feature in X language does not scale in the manner that I wanted.&quot; These statements are very different, and the latter usually indicates very little (unless your desires are similar or identical to what theirs were!).</p>

<p>Another claim to watch for is of the following: &quot;because X language has feature Y, X language must be/not be scalable.&quot; are usually a result of jumping to conclusions. This is because many factors contribute to a language being scalable, and it&#39;s very unlikely that a single feature would render an entire language either scalable or unscalable. On the contrary, language features can be used, misused, or avoided in any number of ways. These decisions all contribute to the characteristics, including scalability, of the product.</p>

<p>ELI5: It&#39;s complicated.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, that is why your function eventually crashes; MRI does not do TCO.</p>

<p>The &quot;what languages do TCO&quot; question is kind of a tricky subject.  In a lot of cases it&#39;s not required by the language specification, so it&#39;s completely up to the implementation.  Most languages fall into this category.  For example, optimizing C and C++ compilers will do TCO in certain circumstances, but there are a myriad of things that might make it impossible, so it can&#39;t really be counted on.  And if it can&#39;t be counted on, then that means you can&#39;t really write code that requires it for proper functionality, like in your example.  Sure, you can if you are willing to always check if the compiler is doing the right thing, but it&#39;s valid for the compiler to stop doing TCO one day for any reason, so it&#39;s not exactly a great position to be in.</p>

<p>There are some languages that do require an implementation to perform TCO as long as you write code in a certain form.  Scheme is one example that comes to mind.  Most languages in this category are of the functional family, stuff you&#39;re probably not using very often.</p>

<p>In the case of Python, TCO is specifically not supported in the reference implementation (CPython) because it results in stack traces that can be confusing, especially since the stack frames are available for introspection.  Maybe other implementations like PyPy can do it; I don&#39;t know.  I imagine the situation is pretty much the same with Ruby, and with most dynamic scripting languages for that matter.  But regardless of whether some implementations can do it, the fact that you can&#39;t depend on it leads to the same problem outlined above — you can only reliably write code in a recursive style that requires TCO for correctness in a language where the specification requires TCO, and those tend to be the sort of functional languages where you use recursion for everything anyway.  Imperative languages rarely have that guarantee, which means that whenever you use recursion you have to do it with the implicit assumption that the recursion depth will be limited.  For example, you wouldn&#39;t want to traverse a linked list using recursion in a non-functional language, but it would be fine to write a recursive tree walker when it&#39;s known that the tree is balanced, or at least that it won&#39;t become degenerate.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Thing is writing docs in a formal way like doxygen offers the possibility to generate detailed documentations in any format (e.g. pdf, html...) by parsing the source code.</p>

<p>Normally a function signature can be parsed anyway, but by allowing the following syntax:</p>

 * Sets the position.
 *
 * @param  x,y,z  Coordinates of the position in 3D space.

void setPosition(double x, double y, double z, double t)
{

}
</code></pre>

<p>a parser like doxygen is able to understand the context of those non-contextual x, y and z names and will describe them accordingly.</p>

<p>While I normally agree that a simple, semantic and clean source code is actually the best documentation, it&#39;s just not feasible on bigger projects. I <em>want</em> the ability to search through the functions and classes and types etc. apart from grepping through all files and see the thousands of lines where function foo() is called but where it (of course) isn&#39;t described what it does.</p>

<p>Browse a little bit through the <a href="https://docs.magentocommerce.com/">Magento docs</a> and compare it to the source code of the Magento Community Edition.

</div><div class="md"><p>To say something about the guidelines...</p>

<p>Um, most online forums have fairly similar rules. As far as I know, not many other places talk about &quot;flairs&quot; and &quot;tagging posts.&quot; So, the average person probably comes here and assumes that the &quot;guidelines&quot; are the typical &quot;be respectful&quot; and other crap you see elsewhere, and they have no real reason to notice or think that there is going to be something like a FAQ (or, if so, the FAQ is also going to state fairly typical crap), &quot;flair&quot; or a need to &quot;tag posts.&quot; </p>

<p>In all honesty--and I might be in the minority on this, but--Reddit has several great things about it that makes it better than most forums...but it also has way more rules than most forums, from what I&#39;ve seen, and way more seemingly stupid things irritate its users. It&#39;s almost a place where it requires too much work to participate if you have to read this, read that, do this to make a post IN ADDITION TO just making your post, etc. I have seen people on other parts of parts of Reddit whine if you don&#39;t have enough spacing between your paragraphs, which, to me, is a shortcoming of Reddit and not the poster&#39;s fault (when you hit enter twice, it should automatically create paragraph space--new people should not be getting chewed out for this or for not knowing Reddit doesn&#39;t have this common-sensical feature that many other places DO have). </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Very few other disciplines are skin to programming in the portability of ideas, and because there is so much software out  and because a single line can be the dieter between success and failure, it&#39;s not viewed in the same light as, say, asking for an idea for a book.  You can&#39;t teach someone artistic talent, someone cannot say, put the last brush stroke on this painting.  If you ask  for MN an idea for a book you still have hundreds of pages I front of you that need to be written.  There&#39;s no analog to physical labor (construction, food service), though i suppose one could argue that you could send a 99% complete blueprint to someone and ask for an idea to finish them, though you&#39;d still be giving them the entire finished product and trusting them not to copy.  Code is simultaneously complex and insignificant, i mean, it&#39;s just one line.  It leads to this weird dichotomy where, it&#39;s super easy to share an idea, or a concept.  The problem with this is that it&#39;s easy to justify asking for help, like i said, it can be as simple as just one line, and the set of exercises to teach programming is finite, so many people go though the exact same set of assignments so the same questions come up over and over.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You should get a vauge understanding how the web works. Then this will become trivial since you will know what you are actually looking for.</p>

<p>First of all, your browser sends text files including a header and a payload/message body. They are called HTTP requests. A web server responds to those messages with HTTP responses. This is true for most websites.</p>

<p>This is also true when you as a user are &quot;logging in&quot;. If you are already logged in, browsers send a small snippet called Cookie within the header. The server sees and then know &quot;oh ok, this user is already logged in&quot;. If there is no cookie, the server will send a login form. If you are typing your credentials into the login form, this data gets sent as form-data within an HTTP POST request. Like a cookie, the server will understand this kind of request: &quot;Oh let&#39;s see, is there a user Bob in the database? Yes. Is his password correct? Ok, let&#39;s sind him a Cookie with the content 1qwu8z7rg32qdbf7443t53 so that he can authorize himself on any future request by sending it to me!&quot;</p>

<p>Now, <a href="/u/timbetimbe">/u/timbetimbe</a> mentioned curl. Curl is able to make HTTP requests of any kind and print/save the response to stdin/a file. Curl is able to send the same form-data you would type into the login form. Curl is able to read a set of Cookies to be included in a request or to save any Cookie the web server includes in the response. It therefore is exactly like a headless browser.</p>

<p>You can use it as a standalone tool that you execute from a shell or as a library that you directly include in your program. In any case, you should look for the Wikipedia pages for all the terms I bombarded you with and after that have a look at the curl documentation. Or maybe stackoverflow/google etc. for curl specifics.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>To 1:</p>

<pre><code>struct produceItem *next;
</code></pre>

<p>You have your next pointer defined as pointer to produceItem and not to another node. Since you do not define a produceItem anywhere, it afaik should be treated like a void pointer, accepting anything. I&#39;d personally write a typedef before defining the struct so it&#39;s possible to use the same type name of the struct within the struct:</p>

<pre><code>typedef struct node node;
struct node {
    ...
    node * next;
}
</code></pre>

<p>To 2:</p>

<pre><code>temp-&gt;price = atoi(strtok(NULL, &quot;,&quot;));
</code></pre>

<p><code>atoi</code> returns and int and not a float. That int get&#39;s implicitly converted to a float and that&#39;s why you are losing the decimals. Use <code>atof</code> or <code>strtof</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You want the <code>else</code> clause to only be run if both of the <code>if</code> tests fail, but that&#39;s not what you wrote.  You wrote them as two different <code>if</code>s, which means they are separate statements.  For example, if the user types &#39;m&#39;, then the first <code>if</code> is tested, and it&#39;s true, so it prints &quot;Him&quot;.  But then the second <code>if</code> is tested, since it&#39;s a separate statement, and that second <code>if</code> is false, so the <code>else</code> clause is executed.</p>

<p>You want all three clauses to be part of the same statement, which means you have to write it like:</p>

<pre><code>if (...) {
    // A
} else if (...) {
    // B
} else {
    // C
}
</code></pre>

<p>Only one of A, B, or C will be executed.  The way you wrote it, you get (maybe A) followed by (either B or C), which is not what you want.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t omit braces even if you have only a single statement in the clause.  That will eventually bite you in the ass.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In addition to what <a href="/u/Rhomboid">/u/Rhomboid</a> and <a href="/u/dgbaker93">/u/dgbaker93</a>  said about using if else, your user prompt asks for an uppercase M or F, but your if statements are testing for lowercase m and f. Maybe you are inputting a capital letter, causing it to always fail.</p>

<p>If you want it to work for both upper and lower case, one way you can write it is:</p>

<p>if (sex == &#39;m&#39; || sex == &#39;M&#39;)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the replies guys using else if definitely worked, really appreciate the help. </p>

<p>For the future, if I want more than three conditionals (I&#39;m going to use four as an example here) would I use an additional else if for each conditional?</p>

<pre><code>if (...) {
    // A
} else if (...) {
    // B
} else if {
    // C
} else{
   // D
}
</code></pre>

<p>Edit: Shortly after typing this post I realized I could just try it out myself and see what happens haha.</p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>if (sex == &#39;m&#39;)  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Him&quot; &lt;&lt; friend_name;
if (sex == &#39;f&#39;) cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Her&quot; &lt;&lt; friend_name;
else{ //if sex input is neither F or M, repeat
        sex = 0;
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;wrong&quot;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is easier to see where the problem is forming. You have no &quot; {} &quot;&#39;s containing your first two ifs.  This is probably wrong, but this is what I believe is going on. </p>

<p>When the code gets to the else it has no If statement to correspond to it so it is always true and will always execute...</p>

<pre><code>if (sex == &#39;m&#39;) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Him&quot; &lt;&lt; friend_name;
} 
else if (sex == &#39;f&#39;) {
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Her&quot; &lt;&lt; friend_name;
} 
else { //if sex input is neither F or M, repeat
        sex = 0;
        cout &lt;&lt; &quot;wrong&quot;;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now each conditional will only be ran at most once. If your sex is &#39;m&#39; then the first condition will run and be true and your else should never execute since the first conditional of your if tree executed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You have some weird quotation and double quotation going on.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You can use either.  The most useful function is probably <code>BufferedReader</code>&#39;s <code>readLine()</code> or <code>Scanner</code>&#39;s <code>nextLine()</code> function.</p>

<p>From there, use <code>String</code>&#39;s <code>split</code> function.</p>

<p>For instance, <code>&quot;a b c d&quot;.split(&quot; &quot;)</code> returns the array <code>[&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, &quot;d&quot;]</code>.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>404 error on the link</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s to allow you to create interfaces.</p>

<pre><code>class Foo {
  public:
    virtual void frobnicate() = 0;
}

class Bar : public Foo {
  public:
    virtual void frobnicate() {
      std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;hello world&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Bar inherits from interface foo.  What does this mean? It means you can now make interesting functions like:</p>

<pre><code>void runFrobnication(const Foo *f) {
  f-&gt;frobnicate();
}

int main() {
  Bar b;
  runFrobnication(&amp;b);
}
</code></pre>

<p>By being PURE virtual, Foo doesn&#39;t have an implementation, but you can use it all over your code to indicate that &quot;whatever you pass in here, must implement the contract provided by Foo&quot;.</p>

<p>So in a more realistic setting, you might do something like:</p>

<pre><code>class Listener {
  public:
    bool handleMessage(const Message &amp;) = 0;
};
void RegisterListener(const Message::Type &amp;, Listener *);

class DamageListener : public Listener {
  public:
    DamageListener(Player &amp;p) : m_p(p) { }
    bool handleMessage(const Message &amp;m) {
       m_p.subtractHealth(m.param1);
    }
  private:
    Player &amp;m_p;
};
</code></pre>

<p>By having the &quot;Listener&quot; interface, you can write a whole handling system that is agnostic to the messages and listeners.  But it also provides you with a concrete way to explain that a &quot;DamageListener&quot; or a &quot;MissileLockedOnListener&quot; must implement a &quot;handleMessage(const Message &amp;)&quot; member function in order to work properly with the rest of the message system.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Abstract classes are interfaces. They exist to be inherited from but never constructed directly. You make functions pure virtual if derived classes <em>must</em> implement them for your program to work correctly.</p>

<p>For instance, you could have something like a <code>std::vector&lt;std::unique_ptr&lt;Prop&gt;&gt; props;</code>, and you might have a bit of code that does:</p>

<pre><code>for(auto&amp; prop : props) {
    prop-&gt;compute();
}
</code></pre>

<p>The creator of the interface <code>Prop</code> doesn&#39;t have a way to generically define <code>compute</code>, so he doesn&#39;t define that function. But he knows that all <code>Prop</code>s must have a meaningful <code>compute</code> to function properly. Therefore, he makes the function pure virtual.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a real world example from research I&#39;ve done:</p>

<p>I need to simulate the initial state of a nucleon in a nucleus (Fermi momentum, removal energy).  How do I do this?  Well, there are many different models, all of which should provide two things:</p>

<p>GetFourMomementum() which returns a FourVector</p>

<p>GetRemovalEnergy() which returns a double</p>

<p>Now- which model do we want to implement?  We don&#39;t know- there are a few to choose from, and nobody has decided which is strictly right.  So we define an interface:</p>

<pre><code>class NuclearModelInterface {
 public:
  virtual FourVector GetFourMomentum() = 0;
  virtual double GetRemovalEnergy() = 0;
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now I can define:</p>

<pre><code>class NuclearModel1: public NuclearModelInterface {
 public:
  virtual FourVector GetFourMomentum() {
    // Implement model 1
  }
  virtual double GetRemovalEnergy() {
    // Implement model 1
  }
};

class NuclearModel2: public NuclearModelInterface {
 public:
  virtual FourVector GetFourMomentum() {
    // Implement model 2
  }
  virtual double GetRemovalEnergy() {
    // Implement model 2
  }
};
</code></pre>

<p>Now, in the rest of my code, if I need to simulate the nuclear initial state, I can pass around a NuclearModelInterface* to whatever function needs it, without knowing anything about how the model is implemented, get an answer for the initial state.</p>

<p>What does that gain us? First, we abstract away irrelevant information- in another part of the simulation, you don&#39;t need to know how or with what model the initial state is chosen, you just need to know what it is.  Additionally, you can choose at run time which model you want to use- you can assign that NuclearModelInterface* to point to either an instance of NuclearModel1 or NuclearModel2, say through a command line options, and without any code modification or recompilation, see what difference it makes in your simulation.</p>

<p>Interfaces are also useful for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object">mock objects</a> when unit testing.</p>

<p>Edit: Forgot to inherit NuclearModel1 and NuclearModel2 from NuclearModelInterface.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Got into it when i was around 12 years old when m dad bought me a ZX Spectrum. I was more interested in coding the programming articles in the back of magazines than anything else.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 38 now and developer for an ISP. What motivates me? I like coding and learning new technologies. Having creative freedom allows me to enjoy me job. It pays well too.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Back in early 80&#39;s my brother has an Atari 800XL with plenty of softwares and books about it. Being a kid, of course I only interested on games. I played them all until I was bored.</p>

<p>Later, I found that among those books there&#39;s a BASIC programming book with lots of sample programs that are mostly games (the book has screenshots and source codes). I asked by brother about it and he confirmed it and told me that if I want to play them, I have to type those long source codes (ranging from 10 to 300 or so lines). He&#39;s not quite interested on them, so I had to type them myself.</p>

<p>There were lots of trials and errors, but eventually, I managed to type them all and ran the simplest game (a text based number guessing game). I have no clue about BASIC, but after more typing and playing the sample games, I got accustomed to the BASIC syntax and grammar.</p>

<p>Then I realized that I could make my own game variation or even start a new simple game. While doing that, I had to make tools to ease things like saving the source codes into files, organizing the files in the floppy disk, and making a menu for quick access to the games.</p>

<p>Finally, I realize that there&#39;s much more that I can create than just games (even though I already knew that there were other non gaming softwares; well, duh...). And that magnified my passion on programming.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have no idea. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ill give the short version. I got interested in this field because of a coop that started with graphics. I was a self taught photoshop expert at 15 or so. (not really an expert but I was good!). Got a coop through school and my coworker/supervisor taught me basic programming in php.</p>

<p>My dad got me into web design back when you wrote html code in notepad files and every site had 300 animated gifs. Good times.</p>

<p>So I planned on going into web design for a career and college, but for reasons I won&#39;t go into, I pursued a dream instead of reality and went into 3d art. Spent 4 years in college for that. The industry crashed and I reverted back to my strength, programming.</p>

<p>At this point, my dream is considered dead and I code to make money to enjoy the life I have and get and do the things I want to do. </p>

<p>I enjoy learning everything that pertains to an interest of mine. Although I have a great job, I started going after my bachelors of computer science as a challenge to myself as no one in my family has obtained a bachelors. It is the same reason I will get a masters in something one day. I also enjoy learning these languages and pushing my skills. I know this will lead to better opportunities and better money some day.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t call myself a programmer, but a programming enthusiast.</p>

<p>All my life, I&#39;ve been romanticizing engineering, and creating things, as a cool career path that&#39;s gonna help the world, and get me some recognition/admiration. But as I went on, esp. since I moved to North America, I realized that programming and software development in general, is what the world is after now, what it recognizes and what it admires.</p>

<p>Honestly, whichever career path you choose here (academic, industrial or entrepreneurial) you almost 100% should know programming, otherwise you&#39;re screwed. Seriously, you can&#39;t produce shit if you don&#39;t know how to program. The demand is crazy. I&#39;m as underqualified as a potato for the both jobs I have now, but there has been two employers who were convinced with my minimal ability to make something with just a computer. I can only imagine what would happen if I really start to become a programmer. I probably gonna be one anyway, esp. I think web-dev and functional web-developers would be insanely in demand for the very foreseeable future.</p>

<p>That&#39;s what fuels me - giving my niche-specific community what it wants.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So my first instinct is to use Python for your backend. You can use a number of different libraries, like Twython, to interact with the Twitter API. You can use the nltk library for sentiment analysis if you want positive/negative tweets, and you can use a very simple web framework like Flask to set up a few basic routes to show your data, and then integrate with a separate front end. Python&#39;s requests library should also make it easy to interact with the weather API. </p>

<p>Oh and for the graph, I&#39;d recommend using nvd3. It makes it fairly easy to create a simple graph to show what you need.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you want to subclass Printer in this instance.</p>

<p>Have you thought about creating a <code>Printer</code> class, that implements a <code>print(String)</code> method, and then you can create an object of this <code>Printer</code> class from your <code>Stars</code> class, and call the <code>print(String)</code> method with the number of stars?</p>

<pre><code>public class Stars {
    public void giveStars(int numberOfStars) {
        Printer printer = new Printer();
        String stars = &quot;&quot;;
        for(int star = 1; star &lt;= numberOfStars; star++) {
            stars += &quot;*&quot;;
        }
        printer.print(stars);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is assuming your <code>Printer</code> class is an actual printer. If you are trying to do a logging class, don&#39;t call it <code>Printer</code>. Call it <code>Logger</code> instead.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So if you have a class &quot;A&quot; you which is an abstract class like so:</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class A { 
    public abstract void someMethod(String string); 
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now you want a class B which extends class A and overrides this method</p>

<pre><code>public class B extends A {
    @Override
    public void someMethoid(String string) {
        System.out.println(string);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>So now class B overrides the &quot;someMethod&quot; in class A</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Are you looking for something that will let you easily build UML? What system are you using so that we know what you can run?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Seriously, dont bother running wine for such a simple task -writing code and running it with Python. Some people will press you hard to learn emacs/vi, but unless you start playing into Linux mainframes and system administration, that&#39;s kind of overkill, to put it mildly.  </p>

<p>IMHO, the best alternative would be going with a Mac Text Editor something like Sublime Text and link it to Python - here&#39;s some <a href="http://dbader.org/blog/setting-up-sublime-text-for-python-development">relevant information</a> about this particular option. This option is basically what you&#39;re doing with Notepad++ as your &quot;IDE&quot;. You could go with other text editors too, like Atom.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You cannot have acces to &quot;normal&quot; Mac software from a program running within wine. (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/6006617">Explanation</a> if you are interested)</p>

<p>You&#39;d have to install the Windows version of Python within wine, but that&#39;s the path of a masochist. I&#39;m not sure if Python would even run this way.</p>

<p>I&#39;d just open a typical mac shell, go to the directory where you save your files and execute them via <code>python file.py</code>.</p>

<p>And if you aren&#39;t required to use Notepad++ I&#39;d instantly switch over to some native Mac text editor/IDE, but that&#39;s just a matter of opinion.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use some software for mac. Notepad++ is just a text editor.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Ask someone at your company? To me it sounds like some proprietary piece of software / toolset.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are certainly ways to do it using just JavaScript (we don&#39;t really need to specify jquery, since it doesn&#39;t add functionality, just shortcuts). </p>

<p>You could have the different content in the same file for a small website, but that means that the user has to download the entire website at once as soon as they enter your webpage. A more sane solution might be to have all the different content in separate files (just the content part, not the entire html code), and pull that in via AJAX. Basically just means you download files from the server while still on the same page. You need to set up a local server to make that work - easyphp/xampp/wamp works. Then, if you&#39;re using jquery, you can just use something like $.load or $.get to pull the content. </p>

<p>You probably want to just pull in the new html, and your stylesheet handles everything that could be loaded in. If you really want to change the stylesheet itself, try to google &quot;css ajax&quot; or &quot;link new stylesheet javascript&quot; or something.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Huh? Most people just write the content on the same html page and perform smooth scrolling. See CSS-Tricks for <a href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/">code</a> and an <a href="https://css-tricks.com/examples/SmoothPageScroll/">example</a>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>that happens to everyone, i read code like a master and write like a monkey</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As someone in a similar place, what I have found useful is:</p>

<p>First, get a piece of paper and break down the question, what exactly does the question want you to do? So break it down into its simplest terms. </p>

<p>Look at each of those steps the question wants you to do, take them as individual and separate from the rest of the question, this is called &quot;black boxing&quot;, as you go through each step slowly a roughly working version of the program will start to piece together, this gives you a base to work from, you may completely rewrite some of it, so don&#39;t be to a attached to what you initially wrote. </p>

<p>So for instance I was doing a question which stated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>for a given number find its highest prime factor </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I just started writing and I kept getting stuck in the first couple of lines, I was thinking about to much at once. So I broke it down: </p>

<pre><code>take a number 
Iterate through all numbers up to its square root 
check each number for primality with the isPrime() function 
if the number is prime check if it is a factor of the given number 
return the highest of these numbers 
</code></pre>

<p>And then the first thing I did was write a function that could take a number and return true if prime else return false, once I had written that I stopped caring about what it did and just focused on the next part of the question.</p>

<p>I had to rewrite some of the code a few times, but it gave me a roughly working prototype with which to start.</p>

<p>Hopefully this helped in some way. </p>

<p>On mobile right now so will fix any formatting issues when I get to a pc. </p>

<p>Abandon that thought straight away. If you have passion and dedication to learning something like RoR etc then why wouldn&#39;t you reach that goal? <strong>Work out your goals now (big and small) and progress towards them</strong>.</p>

<p>You say that you have finished Hartl&#39;s tutorials for RoR but how much do you feel you have learn&#39;t from that? Could you go on to build small/simple ideas from what you know already?</p>

<p>Even though you have learnt RoR, how are your Ruby skills on there own? You should try to build something small with that language, and perhaps also look at something like Sinatra and compare that to RoR.</p>

<p>In terms of Android, how are your Java skills? If you dont know Java, you will find Android difficult. If you learn the base first (Java in this case) then Android will come to you more naturally.</p>

<p>Guess you could say my original intention was to &#39;find a hole in the market and fill it.&#39;</p>

<p>If you have spotted something, I say run with it. Along with that though, it <em>could</em> be near impossible to do something like that alone (I know from experience), so you should never be worried about asking for help, either online or friends that are programmers.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I see so MANY different websites that have good stuff for learning how to code, but its difficult to know which one to choose.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Just pick one and go for it. These sites will help you learn, but you will need to <em>read about code</em> (books/blogs etc) and <em>build actual things</em> along side what a sites content will give you. This is were passion/dedication come in.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do a lot of people usually stick with one thing and master it, or do they branch off and learn many different things?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>IMO, learning different languages and different types of languages (strongly typed, functional etc) will make you a more rounded programmer. But if you can&#39;t build anything in any language to start with then that is a big problem. On the other side though, learning one language can make it easier to pick up others. If you learn the theory/logic then you will be able to say: how do I do <em>this</em> in <em>that</em> language. An example if this is you might use a for loop in Java etc to loop round something. In Ruby, you would probably use an iterator like <em>each</em> to do the same thing.</p>

<p><strong>Java</strong></p>

<pre><code>for(int i= 0; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
//Loop over 5 times
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Ruby</strong></p>

<pre><code>0.upto(5).each do |i|
//Loop over 5 times
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Single line version Ruby</strong> </p>

<pre><code>0.upto(5).each {|i| loop over 5 times }
</code></pre>

<p>You should be comfortable with programming concepts like:</p>

<ul>
<li>variables</li>
<li>arrays</li>
<li>types</li>
<li>loops</li>
<li>conditionals</li>
<li>functions/methods</li>
<li>functions/methods with arguments</li>
<li>return values</li>
<li>objects/classes</li>
<li>inheritance</li>
</ul>

<p>I say stick to one language for a while and build lots with it. Even if you think what you are building is useless, something is better than nothing. Keep at it and get more complicated as you go.</p>

<p>Its important to <strong>Learn the language</strong> and <strong>not just the framework</strong> i.e (jQuery/JS, Ruby/RoR, Java/Android).</p>

<p>I knew nothing 5 years ago - but Ive self taught myself everything and understand the struggle and how daunting it can be to learn things like this.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m on Treehouse&#39;s Android Dev and Rails tracks and the right now. It&#39;s $25/mo, but I think it&#39;s well worth it if you can put it the time. By the end of the Android track I&#39;ll have made about 5 apps, and hopefully I&#39;ll be able to start working on my own. </p>

<p>Rails has been a bit less straight forward. I&#39;ll get to a certain point in the track and then I&#39;ll realized that I want to build other skills before I continue, so I spend time familiarizing myself other stuff(javascript, html, css, jquery, ajax) and then make my way back to rails. After I&#39;m done with the track I&#39;m going to give <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/engineering-software-service-uc-berkeleyx-cs169-1x#.VPdm-PnF_YR">this edX course</a> a try, it looks pretty good.</p>

<p>I&#39;m learning both those things at the same time, and I can&#39;t say for sure because I&#39;ve still got a long way to go, but I think it&#39;s working well so far. Give it a try and see how you feel. I find that while the languages don&#39;t really overlap, general programming concepts definitely do and it just helps to see them in different contexts. Also, I when I hit a wall or just get tired of one subject, it really helps to be able to switch to the other for a while and come back. </p>

<p>Passion and dedication, like the other commenter said. I&#39;d been dabbling in programming for years, and hadn&#39;t gotten anywhere. I decided at end of last year that this is what I want to do more than anything else, and I&#39;ve really committed to that idea. In these last few months I&#39;ve learned more than I had in all the years I&#39;d been dabbling, and I feel like I&#39;m on my way to making a career out of programming. So good luck, and keep at it.   </p>

<p>But seriously, this is not 1970.  Why in the world do you think kids shouldn&#39;t be touching your computers?  That&#39;s insane.  </p>

<p>You want kids to get excited about computing? Let them do it.  They all want to make video games.  Go for it. </p>

<p>I just tonight got back from an event with a 4-H group, where every kid got on a computer, and I taught them how to make video games with scratch (Scratch.mit.edu)  They loved it.  </p>

<p>I have a variation of this event at science events all the time.  I run a half-dozen laptops and teach my students a five-minute version of the &#39;build a game&#39; activity.  Then I&#39;ve got a college student sitting at each computer, ready to help kids learn.  I have as big a crowd as anybody, and some kids would literally stay all day if we&#39;d let them.  </p>

<p>Then when my students are working with the kids, I talk to the parents and give them cards with links to great computer science resources including scratch, free art, music and gaming apps, and more.  </p>

<p>I&#39;ve found a couple of ways to get over the &#39;kids touching computers&#39; thing.  First, I keep my eye open for laptops that are being thrown away and repurpose them with ubuntu.  New laptops, like magic, for free.  I&#39;ve got eight right now, and if something happens to one, I don&#39;t care. I can always get more.  </p>

<p>Also, we&#39;ve experimented with Raspberry Pis.  $35 for a complete computer on a chip.  It&#39;s really amazing.  We kept all the pis in a box under the table, and bought used keyboards, mice, and monitors for close to nothing.  I can build a 5-station setup for under $200 easily.  If they mess up the keyboards or mice, we just replace them with other used parts.  They never get near the actual computer, but they love it when we show it to them, because they&#39;ve never seen a computer &#39;outside the box&#39; before, and it&#39;s kind of cool looking.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The first thing to work on, by far, is just programming. Don&#39;t worry about too much about employability yet (you can find a job in any reasonably popular language anyway)- get your programming skills as solid as possible.</p>

<p>So with that in mind, choose whatever language you think will most motivate you to keep programming. A lot of people really like Python as the syntax is especially simple to learn.  You may prefer to start by designing browser apps/games, in which case Javascript is your choice. Or you want to start doing smartphone apps- then learn Java or Objective C.  Up your general programming skills, then worry about finding a job. In any case, once you know one (non-functional) language very well, others are easy to pick up.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Wrong question. The choice of language will not have an impact making you employable asap by being easier to learn, but by being in higher demand. Aside from that, most languages are equally hard to learn.</p>

<p>You get the point, I don&#39;t know much about cars - but I&#39;m able to use one and not have to know how they work. Hopefully that helps</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What can do, nothing?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.generatedata.com/">http://www.generatedata.com/</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you don&#39;t use curly braces after a conditional statement, only the next line is considered it&#39;s body/content:</p>

<pre><code>if (a == b) {
    doFoo();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>if (a == b)
    doFoo();
</code></pre>

<p>However</p>

<pre><code>if (a == b) {
    doFoo();
}
doBar();
</code></pre>

<p>Is the equivalent of:</p>

<pre><code>if (a == b)
    doFoo();
doBar();
</code></pre>

<p>So with your example you&#39;d need:</p>

<pre><code>if (a + b &gt;= 47 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 21) &lt;---- true statement
{                                     
    if (x &lt; a) {  &lt;---- false statement
        System.out.println(&quot;ONE&quot;);
        System.out.println(&quot;TWO&quot;);
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I recommend always using braces with if/else statements to resolve these cases of confusion, but you should know how they work without it in case you see code like this in the real world.</p>

<p>Anyways, without braces, the if/else statement encloses up to the next statement and no further (essentially, until the next <code>;</code>)</p>

<p>So:</p>

<pre><code>if (a &gt; b)
    doX();
 doY();
</code></pre>

<p>is the same as:</p>

<pre><code>if (a &gt; b){
    doX();
}
 doY();
</code></pre>

<p>Same applies with the else</p>

<pre><code>if (x &gt; y)
    doX();
else
    doY();
</code></pre>

<p>and you can mix and match</p>

<pre><code>if (b &gt; c){
    doA();
    doB();
} else
    doC();
</code></pre>

<p>But please use braces everywhere, it makes it so much easier to read.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>If you want to learn C#, you should go and learn C#, not VB. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You should probably start with x86 assembly.  After that write your own C compiler.  Once you complete that task you can implement the .NET framework yourself from the ground up.  This should give you a sufficient background to begin learning C#.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There aren&#39;t really any differences in the difficulty between languages. Some have less syntax rules therefore you have to think about the details and repeat yourself probably more often (hello Go, <code>if err != nil ...</code>) others have a more expressive syntax where you can focus more on the actual logic but where more happens in fewer lines.</p>

<p>But in the end, (nearly) all of them are turing-complete. They are equal in power, able to compute the same solutions to the same problems. And the actual difficulty in programming is solving problems, not implementing them.</p>

<p>So, you are wasting your time if you learn any other language than you actually need.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;ve been trying for the past week, surely you have some ideas or failed code that you can share with us so we can help you along. Where are you getting stuck? Have you tried googling it? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You really should already have some code.</p>

<p>At least, you should be able to produce the code to read the user input.</p>

<p>Other than that a  few guidelines:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Make a class</p>

<ul>
<li>Make a main method that:

<ol>
<li>Instantiates a Scanner</li>
<li>Prompts the user to input a positive integer</li>
<li>Retrieves the integer from the user and stores it in a variable</li>
<li>Start a <code>while</code>-loop here</li>
<li>Calls the method that tests for a prime</li>
<li>Prints the result - prime or not</li>
<li>Prompts the user for another positive integer or -1 to exit</li>
<li>Retrieves the integer from the user and stores it in a variable</li>
<li>Check if the number == -1 (HINT: This can be done with a <code>while</code> loop.)

<ul>
<li>if the number != -1 return to step 5 - this is done by the <code>while</code> part of the loop.</li>
<li>if the number == -1 exit the program</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Make a static method in your class that checks if the number is a prime or not. Return a boolean that indicates prime when it&#39;s true.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>The method to test for a prime is to loop from 2 to &lt;user number&gt;/2 and check if the remainder of the division of &lt;user number&gt; divided by &lt;loop index&gt; == 0 (HINT: Java has the modulo <code>%</code> operator to get the remainder of a division).</p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>if ( input == 2 ) &quot;prime&quot;  
else if ( input mod 2 == 0 ) &quot;not prime&quot;  
else for ( int i = 3; i&lt;input/2; i+2)  {  
  if ( input mod i == 0) &quot;not prime&quot;  }  
&quot;prime&quot;  
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Don&#39;t just downvote.  What&#39;s wrong with it?  I&#39;m pretty sure the logic is sound.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s the general direction:</p>

<hr/>

<p>First you need to read a file and store it&#39;s contents in an array:</p>

<p>Functions needed: fopen, fclose, fgets, strtok</p>

<p>You&#39;ll need to read in from stdin (command line) in a while loop, and check the contents of stdin against your file:</p>

<p>Functions needed: fgets, strcmp</p>

<p>Libraries needed: stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h</p>

<hr/>

<p>PSEUDOCODE:</p>

<pre><code>includes

Main
    FILE * fp;
    char dict[1000][1000] = {0};     /* 1000 words, length 1000 */
    int i;

     fp = fopen(&quot;dictionary.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
     for(i = 0; i &lt; 1000; i++)
         fgets(dict[i], 1000, fp)
    fclose(fp);

    while(!(stdin == &#39;\n&#39;))
        fgets(stdin)
        while(dictionary)
            if(strcmp(stdin, arraycontents) == 0)
                 printf(&quot;This matches word in dict!&quot;);
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t running code, and there are some cases you can add (or even use dynamic memory instead of static, but if you&#39;re new I wouldn&#39;t recommend.)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Assuming you aren&#39;t trying to make a real spell checker (that suggests correct words that are close to your input) and are instead just trying to see if a word is listed...</p>

<p>You will want <code>scanf</code> to handle input, <code>fopen</code> and <code>fclose</code> to handle opening and closing your dictionary file, and then <code>strcmp</code> to compare the two strings. Note as well that <code>strcmp</code> is case sensitive so you may want to use something like <code>tolower</code> to make the user input lowercase.</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>getData: This method reads and stores the data in the two-dimensional array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read this as getData being a method that ultimately accepts a filename and modifies private member variables in the object.
For now getData can create its own temperatures, but I think it still needs to modify members.
A static method can not modify any member of object which the function is called from.</p>

<p>Under what I described, &#39;setData&#39; would be a more appropriate name, since your setting private members in a class.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t know what that main method is doing inside the class. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Update: I got this working, the outputs are correct, now I need refinement and critiquing. Any thoughts? I still need to modify my getData() method to use a text file</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>[deleted]</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The best way is to give the source and dependencies so people can build/run it on their own.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just use the quadratic formula, and if the variable under the squareroot is negative then you know it&#39;s imaginary. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>How do you know and how much do you have so far?</p>

<p>The first step is to have the use enter a, b, c, the parameters of the quadratic. </p>

<p>The solution to the quadratic equation is:</p>

<pre><code> X=(-b +/- sqrt (b^2 - 4ac) ) / ( 2a)
</code></pre>

<p>And there will be imaginary roots if b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac is negative. So first calculate thay and test it. If it is imaginary you can set some flag. I would use floats or doubles depending on how precise you need to be, here is why: </p>

<p>In case you arent sure what the difference between floats and ints are (<a href="http://www.byte-notes.com/data-types-c">here</a> is a page describing different datatypes. And <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point">here</a> is wikipedias page on floats). A float stores numbers in scientific notation so that you can do decimal points. Int truncate. So PI store as an in would be just 3, but pi stored as a float will be 3.141592</p>

<p>So lets get to coding:</p>

<p>Declare:</p>

<pre><code> float coeff_a, coeff_b, coeff_c, discriminant, numerator, denominator;
</code></pre>

<p>Then have a function that will use cout and cin prompts to populate coeff_a, b, c.</p>

<p>Then, calculate the discriminant:</p>

<pre><code> discriminant= pow (coeff_b,2) -2*coeff_c*coeff_a;
</code></pre>

<p>Pow is included in math.h, so be sure to add the include at the top of your program. </p>

<p>At this point,  using a case statement or a set of ifs, you can test if the discriminant is positive, you will have two real roots. If it is zero there will be one real root. If it is negative there will be two imaginary roots.</p>

<p>This is a good point to speak about one caveat of floating points. You shouldnt compare them directly because they will only match if they are exactly the same number, and that seldom hapoens because of something called precision.  Many times when you expect 0 you will actually get 1e-12 or something tiny like that. You can read up on it in the Wikipedia link. So we cant just test like this:</p>

<pre><code> if (discrminant==0.0){...}
</code></pre>

<p>we actually have to do this:</p>

<pre><code> if (abs(discriminant)&lt;= PRECISION_FLOAT){...}
</code></pre>

<p>Where PRECISION_FLOAT is something from a define statement that is specific to your machine. </p>

<p>So at the top of the program add:</p>

<pre><code> #define PRECISION_FLOAT .0000002 //adjust this for your machine
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can continue with our set of if statements:</p>

<pre><code> if(abs (discriminant)&lt;=PRECISION_FLOAT){
         //code for 1 real root
 }
 else if (discriminant&gt; 0.0){
        //code for 2 real roots
 }
 else {
       // code for imaginary roots
 }
</code></pre>

<p>At this point you need to fill in the three blocks and I will get to that next. </p>
