Currently each user is assigned a different terminal under dev/xxx/1, dev/xxx/2, etc. Each user only has permissions for their own terminal and this program with make it so the user can grant the &quot;other&quot; user group permissions to write to terminal.

</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you so much for this. Building on solid foundations is the exact reason I have essentially started again. I was lazy skipped over many of the essentials.</p>

<p>When you say forget the trendy languages - are you suggesting I use &#39;Haskell&#39; - the language taught in the first book you recommended? Or would the information in the first book apply to most languages?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You know what my code is wrong?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>FWIW, as your site and user counts grows, so will the languages you use. All the major players use a large number of scripting languages for everything and a few select compiled languages (C/C++/Java or even inventing their own, eg: Hack/HHVM &amp; Go) to take over performance-critical parts of the infrastructure. The fact is your product has to work and nobody but the engineers crawling around in the code really care what language it&#39;s written in.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>also what does this have to do with learn<em>programming</em>?  It&#39;s very basic computer usage, not programmer.  You can&#39;t even really write a bash script in this thing.</p>

<p>That aside, why can&#39;t you just run a live cd or install linux, bsd, etc in a VM?  That would give you a full and real *nix system.  If you break something, you could easily restore from a vm snapshot within minutes (or just reboot in case of livecd)</p>

<p>also you already need unix installed for this to work.  Usage case might be better if it ran from windows or a web browser.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You mean the current working directory? Try <code>getcwd</code> in <code>&lt;unistd.h&gt;</code>.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>My confidence comes from the fact that I&#39;ve tested it and have been able to encrypt and decrypt data properly. Also &quot;...&quot; doesnt help anything. I guess I misunderstood what you were referring to when you said reusing the IV. I would appreciate if you would elaborate what you mean.</p>

<p>If it&#39;s fun for you, who cares what anyone else thinks? I understand that it&#39;s a stack, but the fact that I don&#39;t have a &quot;pop&quot; method means it&#39;s a push only stack.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Or, if you&#39;re on a Linux/Unix system, force yourself to use the shell to do everyday tasks. Want to download an image - curl or wget it.

<p>Ok, my mistake. Although, calling a variable <code>l</code> is <em>horrible</em> of you. </p>

<p>(EDIT: I am blind.)</p>

<p><del>And I just realized something else. How does the call to strcpy make sense here at all?</del></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No.</p>

<p>Primitive variables can hold only <em>a single value</em>.</p>

<p>To store multiple values under a single variable name, you have to use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/arrays.html">arrays (Orcale tutorial link)</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The prime number program you have is not O(n). The n-th prime number is approximately n log(n) - this is something you need to know from math. So in order to get the n-th prime number you need to go about n log(n) times through the outer loop. In the worst cases (when the current number you are checking is prime), the inner loop checks n/2 times if n is divisible by currentCheck. So the algorithm should be somewhere around O(n<sup>2</sup> log(n)) as an upper limit. </p>

<p>You basically want to check how the number of operations increases with n. 
I hope that helps. You can also plot the evaluation time vs. n to get an idea how the algorithm scales (though it can be time consuming and won&#39;t really be a proof)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Good point thanks.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Depends on your use case. </p>

<p>C# (along with Java) are classic JIT OOP languages. Go is a concurrency-aware compiled language. Those four words (JIT, compiled, OOP, concurrency-aware) should already be significant differentiators for what you think you need. </p>

<p>Take JIT vs compiled for example: In a JIT, a portion of your code is optimized during runtime by the VM based on the real world data it received, this is not possible with compiled language. On the other hand for compiled language, you can manually optimize code. Questions you can ask yourself is &quot;Would my codebase and data be in such that JIT optimization would benefit me?&quot;, &quot;Would I want to optimize the codebase myself?&quot;</p>

<p>There are questions like this that you should ask yourself for pretty much every area that stands out in both languages. (i.e. data access, caching, serialization, service architecture, service communication, exception handling, IDE, static analysis, testing)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll look into this thanks.</p>

<p>IMHO (and experience), this translates from director-ese directly into &quot;I don&#39;t really know anything about what I&#39;m talking about, but I need to justify telling you all what to do so I&#39;m just gonna run my mouth&quot;.</p>

<p>There are some technical reasons why you might choose c# over go.  If you are writing windows applications, c# gives you direct access to the .NET framework and makes doing &quot;windows-ey&quot; things really easy.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I thought you wanted exactly what you posted: i.e. the source code within <code>&lt;source&gt;</code> tags, complete with formatting.</p>

<p>Also, the path you&#39;ve posted (<code>/html/body/table/tbody/tr[43]/td[2]/text()</code>) is not valid. There&#39;s no <code>table</code> element inside the source of the website you&#39;ve linked in your first post. Are you sure Chrome Developer Tools give a correct XPath?

You won&#39;t stare blankly at your code and wonder why .to_s isn&#39;t translating your integer into a string for 20 minutes until you realize you aren&#39;t using ruby anymore.

</div><div class="md"><p>What are you having trouble with in particular?</p>

<p>If it&#39;s homework I can&#39;t help with all of it (and I don&#39;t know assembly that well anyway), but some tips to get started:</p>

<ol>
<li>The file is in MASM syntax. Do a web search for &quot;MASM Programmers Guide&quot; and you&#39;ll find way more information about MASM then you&#39;ll want, along with some nice info about the architecture.</li>
<li><p><code>INT 21h</code> is a hint that this is probably 8086 DOS code. You can see a table of common interrupts <a href="http://spike.scu.edu.au/%7Ebarry/interrupts.html">here</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For example this part from your code will write &quot;Enter : &quot; to STDOUT:</p>

<pre><code>; Move &quot;Write string to STDOUT&quot; interrupt number into AH
mov ah, 9              
; Move segment offset to m1 into DX
; (don&#39;t need to set DS as it was done above)
mov dx, offset m1  
; Trigger the interrupt
int 21h 
</code></pre></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><code>db</code> is an initializer for a sequence of bytes. I think it works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>m2      db      0ah,0dh, &#39;Reverse: $&#39;</code> makes the variable <code>m2</code> refer to the sequence of bytes 0xA, 0xD, &quot;Reverse: $&quot;</li>
<li><code>del2 db 100 dup (0)</code> makes <code>del2</code> refer to a sequence of 100 zeroes.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>I think <code>m proc</code> and <code>m endp</code> marks the beginning and end of a procedure named <code>m</code></p></li>
<li><p>As far as going from there, I just do <em>lots and lots</em> of web searches and reading. And take things one part at a time. </p></li>
</ol>
</div><div class="md"><p>Check out musicforprogramming.com</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This would be an excellent opportunity to learn about regular expressions.</p>

<p>Can you give me a few examples of this naming variation? I&#39;m not sure it&#39;ll 100% solve your problem, but regex might cover 95% of it, leaving only the edge cases to be dealt with .</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You may want to ask at <a href="/r/phphelp">/r/phphelp</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Then look up some XPath tutorials and play a bit with that extension. If you point at a webpage element with your mouse, you will see an XPath query. Try modifying it - enter different selectors that you&#39;ve learned from tutorials. After you get a hang of it, try entering <code>//script</code> into your extension&#39;s query box and see what happens. Then figure out a way to target that specific <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag with the help of tutorials.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>A one-to-many relationship is created when a table has a column (non-unique) that foreign keys to another table.</p>

<p>For instance, suppose you have a <code>users</code> table (with <code>userId</code> as the primary key).  Then you make a <code>documents</code> table (with <code>documentId</code> as the primary key), and the <code>documents</code> table has a column <code>creatorUserId</code> that is a foreign key to <code>users</code>.  So you have a one-to-many relationship because a user can have multiple documents that the user created.</p>

<p>A one-to-one relationship is created when a table has a primary key that also foreign keys to another table.</p>

<p>For instance, if you also made a <code>learnProgrammingUsers</code> table, with a primary key on <code>userId</code>, which also is a foreign key to the <code>users</code> table, then you have a 1-1 mapping.  A user in <code>learnProgrammingUsers</code> has a corresponding entry in <code>users</code>.  A user in the <code>users</code> table may or may not have an entry in the <code>learnProgrammingUsers</code>; if not, then this would be a one-to-optional-one mapping.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I can probably write a search algorithm that works in O(n<sup>n</sup> ) and creates a new pointer that never gets deleted which is bound to a constant if you want. I&#39;ll even make it incorrect for any case above 100, so that even if you wait the billions of years it would take to search for your object, it wouldn&#39;t find it. Also I could reuse code instead of generalizing it, causing the program to be thousands of lines. And maybe I&#39;ll even hard code the input array as a constant so that you have to edit the source code in order to make it function. I think I could get a bit of efficiency back however by only using three variables, and I&#39;ll simply do mathematical manipulations on one of them to act as the entirety of the bools/ints I will need. These vars should of course be stored globally, for maximum efficiency.</p>

<p>100% memory and CPU usage, incorrect in the general case, massively bloated, important inputs are stored as in code constants, ridiculously inefficient, complex mathematical wankery that&#39;s very hard to debug, and placing all of my key variables in global, did I miss anything?</p>

<p>edit: Also I&#39;ll make it run in parallel to ensure maximal CPU usage, but I will incorrectly use critical sections so that the thing actually runs (number of cores)<sup>2</sup> slower than it should!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I heard of objc, but what is like on windows? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The whole semester has just been rewriting our code to meet new criteria, so it&#39;s been evolving from the same source. I&#39;d say I&#39;m comfortable with those variables but I understand your point.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>While that would be a good idea, I have no required range that&#39;s not the required range of ints.

</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s JavaScript. And yes, other than the first four letters of the name and a superficial similarity in the syntax, Java and JavaScript don&#39;t have a lot in common. They are quite different languages. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t want to drag this on any longer than it needs to be but your second tutorial has just the same flaws as your first one. To me it does feel like you know what you are doing but you are not doing a good job at explaining it. There are lots of good C++ video tutorials out there, use them as reference. </p>

<p>To point one more thing out: If you want short videos, cover the materials appropriate for the length. Talking fast won&#39;t make your video go up in quality, people are just forced to rewind and repeat a million times. If you want to cover lots of material then just do longer videos. No one will learn C++ or SDL in 10 5 minute videos but maybe in 10 30 minute videos. </p>

<p>And again please make sure you aim your videos at a target audience. In video two you already talk about pointers and memory leaks but you also explain what comments are and how they are done. This seem like two topics that should be at least a couple units apart.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you, simple answer to a simple question. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No problem. Buy do you know what p,c,pred are? I ask because one day you might be asked to do this for an interview and youll have to explain it. So if you do not know  now is the time to really learn it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In terms of programming, I find it easier in practice to describe it as &#39;the total number of loop iterations, plus the total number of procedure calls&#39;. Those are the features that contribute to time complexity, everything else (at least in many programming languages) can be summed up as constant-time operations, and this way you simplify the algorithm&#39;s structure and avoid counting something for either more or less than it is.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Wow thanks so much for this perspective. I&#39;m starting to feel a bit better and revved up reading all these replies haha. Worst comes to worse I know what to expect and can prepare myself accordingly. Thanks!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Please do work on your teaching skills. It still remains to me unclear who your target audience is. It seems like a hybrid of C++ beginners and intermediate coders, but that&#39;s clearly a bad mixture. As a tip: you may want to consider creating a Unit 0, containing what you will do in your tutorial, who it is aimed for and how to set up the IDE so you can focus solely on coding. Also consider writing a script for your tutorials. As of now it sounds a lot like you&#39;re doing things of the top of your head, rather unstructured.</p>

<p>Edit: I had a chance to look more at the video and honestly, 3 minutes of your video is just &quot;look what Ive made&quot;. You even sound excited about, which is cool but a quarter of a tutorial should not be dedicated to &quot;look what I made&quot; but rather &quot;this is what we did today, here are more learning resources if you want to know more and next time we will do this&quot;</p>

product price units type client month<br/>
?  </p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by &quot;my counter is never incremented&quot;, do you mean maxSize (for successful calls to testeValidade()?).  </p>

<p>Anyway I think your processing of the input lines is wrong. You commented out the code that reads the price and type tokens, I guess because testeValidade() doesn&#39;t use them, but that means they don&#39;t get pulled out of the token stream. For example in your switch statement, the first time through aux == 1, so you will now call atoi(token) to try to read units, but I think strtok() will return the price token, which won&#39;t work going through atoi() (or will only return the part of the price before the .). And then you&#39;ll try to read the client string when aux == 2, but you&#39;ll be at the units token, and so on.  </p>

<p>I would modify each case in your switch to print out the value of token along with what piece of data you expect to be reading at that point, and see if they make sense.</p>

<p>But, that isn&#39;t how it works. Technology not necessarily being simple and a layer of making profit on top has given us consumers DHCP for our home internet service. Yes, you may be assigned an IP and have it for months-- but it will likely change at some point in time.</p>

<p>There are solutions to this. My proposed solution is two fold OpenWRT/DD-WRT/Tomato third-party firmware on a commodity router with DDNS service by No-IP or DynDNS.</p>

<p>The first step is going to your domain registrar and setting that your DNS is handled by a DDNS company. Essentially it tells anyone trying to resolve mydomain.com that this DDNS company will provide the IP.</p>

<p>The more powerful third-party firmware on the router gives you a place to configure your DDNS service with your subscription credentials and monitors your IP address-- as soon as your IP changes, your account information and IP address are sent to your Dynamic DNS provider over the web which in turn let&#39;s the world in on the change.</p>

<p>So, people are asking for the resources associated with your domain name and their request packets are being delivered to your house on port 80. Good job. --But, port 80 on your router from the outside on your publicly facing IP (which is subject to change from time to time) doesn&#39;t have a web server running.</p>

<p>Now that router does it&#39;s second duty, it does some Network Address Translation (NAT). You specify if the outside IP gets packets for port 80 (http) or 443 (https) send them to the internal IP of my web server and the reverse for outgoing on those ports.</p>

<p>Boom, now people including yourself can hit a web server inside your house with reasonable reliability despite your internet service providers not giving you the same guaranteed IP address.</p>

<p>That being said-- stop it. It is dangerous and not good to host a machine in your house as a beginner. Get a cheap VPS (I use linode, I hear good things about digital ocean, vps.net, and bottom of the barrel cheap is buyvm.net) and for ~$10 a month you can get service that will blow your raspberry pi out  of the water for processing and no home networking shenanigans.</p>

<p>People will note the functional, pure, SOLID ideals of clean and beautiful code.  I argue that true local evolution can be difficult to achieve, and that inexperienced developers often have trouble defining what &quot;single responsibility&quot; really means.</p>

<p>If you write your code in a procedural manner, whether that&#39;s stateful or stateless (less state is usually &quot;better&quot;), you can examine and refactor as you place.</p>

<p>I see very experienced programmers who are able to formulate abstractions on-the-fly, a sort of &quot;write your API first&quot; approach.  They can do this because they understand the problem space well.  Focus on solving problems first, then on coming up with elegant solutions.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>My recommendation would be to pick one part to learn at a time.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example. I&#39;m going from the assumption you don&#39;t know JavaScript.</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn JavaScript. You can do this both in browser and NodeJS.</li>
<li>Focus on learning more about NodeJS and make a basic application using Express.</li>
<li>Build a database-backed app with Express and MongoDB</li>
<li>Add AngularJS</li>
</ul>

<p>See how each step builds on top of the previous? If you try to learn all at once, it can be overwhelming, so it&#39;s better to do it in a more gradual way where you can build on what you already know.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Each have a bit different pattern, but the goal should be to make commits useful for anyone reading them. For example, if I&#39;m fixing some bugs or refactoring code, I sometimes look at <code>git blame</code> to determine what commit introduced some code. If the commit has a useful message, and the code in it looks cohesive to a single task, it&#39;s easier to determine what I should do with it, or if it should be there or not.</p>

<p>Your approach seems good. It sounds like they would include a fairly self-contained piece of work.</p>

<p>Some general guidelines I find useful:</p>

<ul>
<li>Length doesn&#39;t usually matter. Sometimes you&#39;ll have tiny commits, otherwise it&#39;s a bit longer</li>
<li>Sometimes it&#39;s helpful to commit often, and you can then use <code>git rebase -i</code> to combine some of them together</li>
<li>If you are fixing line-endings or indentation issues, use a separate commit! It can be difficult to see what changes were made to code if it also includes white-space changes</li>

<p>How do you know if these devs are not polluting the code with the same code mistakes every time?</p>

<p>They absolutely are. I see it nearly every time they push to the repo. I&#39;ve brought code quality up to their managers separately from the code reviews.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do you have a process in place to avoid this or just total anarchy?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s not total anarchy, but neither is there anything that can prevent it. There are various phases of testing that keep the worst offenders for correctness and performance from going out. There are no usable metrics or policies for code quality in place right now, and it&#39;s virtually impossible to convince these stubborn devs that what they first came up with is not sufficient; from my perspective it seems like they&#39;re too prideful or insecure to admit they did not do good enough.</p>

Then I looked all over the SDL2 wiki and learned about the functions and enums that can be used to create graphics and use sprites. I am also working right now on a small space game for fun to test myself with simple &quot;AI&quot; that moves if something comes toward it or attacking if the player if in range, things like that I might go over the programming in it for a tutorial but I really don&#39;t think it is very hard. I also learned in programming has a lot to do with your mind and thinking out for long periods of time how you could make something move or a background move with a player I did this with my mind just thinking things out. It came very easy to me. I may not be the best teacher but I can work on it.</p>

<p>There has to be a reason Facebook chose PHP and Twitter chose Ruby</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You should not neglect the popular reason - developers who started these things simply preferred specific languages because they used them recently and feel more confident. When you are doing some startup, there are two crucial points:</p>

<ul>
<li>choose the more suitable language;</li>
<li>choose the language which you know better (because language which you do not know will suit poorly because you surely will kick around many bugs and wrong solutions at beginning).</li>
</ul>

<p>While these languages are different enough in its syntax and even &quot;paradigm&quot;, technically it is almost the same, moreover that nowadays popular approach is to build sites as Rest API + nice javascript client (written in Angular etc.) - for such cases it is even less important which language you will choose - add Node.JS, C# and Java here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everyone says the language doesn&#39;t matter but there has to be differences.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Surely there are difference. Python is bit more organized compared to PHP, but has two still not merged versions. PHP retains OOP structure closely reminding one of Java and C#. Ruby is &quot;more functional&quot; than both. Node.Js is chosen by those who want to &quot;do all in one language&quot;, but sacrificing OOP. It is mostly the matter of personal preferences. Technically all those languages are scripting ones and their performance and features are comparable.</p>

<p><strong>More difference</strong> is made when you use some compiled language, like Java / C# / Scala etc. Development with them could seem bit more robust (but more slow and somewhat more expensive). They are often chosen by larger teams for products which are going to be developed and supported during long period of time. Roughly speaking they make you write slower, but debug less (especially others&#39; code). The same was with Facebook&#39;s &quot;PHP&quot; - you know they wrote special translator which converts PHP sources into C++ language and then compiles them (if I am not mistaken).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh, and one more note: Twitter started with Ruby, but specifically they started with Ruby on Rails, a popular framework that makes it easier to build a web app. However, performance wasn&#39;t very good and they abandoned it entirely, switching to Java.</p>

<p>Facebook also had performance problems with PHP and they spent enormous effort building a PHP compiler.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just another thought. If there is a value outside of your required range, say -1, actually set the array initially to that value and then if you encounter it you&#39;ll know that index has not yet been set by you.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In this particular case, those three languages are quite similar and the main reason to choose one is due to personal preference.</p>

<p>In contrast, some places use C++, Go, Java, or C#, and those are quite different. Roughly, though, those four languages favor performance, where as Ruby, Python, and PHP all favor ease of development.</p>

<p>PHP is the easiest language to get started, because you can take an existing HTML file and add some inline PHP to it to make it dynamic. It&#39;s got tons of features built-in for web development.</p>

<p>The main criticism of PHP is that it&#39;s incredibly poorly designed. Its features are inconsistent with each other and the defaults are often awful for security. It&#39;s possible to write good-quality PHP (see: Facebook) but it requires a lot of discipline.</p>

<p>Ruby and Python are both general-purpose, modular languages. They don&#39;t have any features for web development built-in like PHP does, but there are thousands of popular libraries that either come with the standard distribution or are easy to download and install that provide everything you need.</p>

<p>Ruby favors expressiveness: you can do clever, complex things with just a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Python favors readability: the language is very simple and clear, and &quot;there&#39;s only one way to do it&quot; so it&#39;s very easy to read someone else&#39;s Python code.</p>

<p>One thing I&#39;ll add is that there are no panaceas in software.  That&#39;s also been phrased as &quot;no silver bullets&quot;, a well known book on the subject.</p>

<p>Yes, you learned node and angular and mongo.  Great.</p>

<p>They&#39;re handy for some problems and shitty for others.</p>

<p>Same for every other technology and stack out there.  Even methodologies and processes.</p>

<p>Nothing solves everything or applies everywhere.</p>

<p>So pay attention not just to what specific tools are good at, but also what they&#39;re bad at.  Then learn other tools that complement them well, or step outside the box and create new tools.</p>

<p>No programmer is a god.</p>

<p>We&#39;re all down in the swamp chopping away at frustrating problems, and even our successes are often unintentional.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I took a C# job because it&#39;s what I could get, not because it&#39;s what I wanted. I don&#39;t like IDEs (nothing against folks who like them, but for me it&#39;s mostly cruft, I&#39;m happiest with a CLI, and editor, and not much else[1]). My brain just doesn&#39;t map to the much &#39;friendlier&#39; nature of the VS2010 we were using, nor did I really grok the way project configuration worked. It was also a pretty gnarly codebase with some pretty unique (and terrible) habits. Piled onto this tool impedance mismatch was the fact that I was siloed off into working on a subsystem (the Finance/Reporting tool) by myself, with minimal oversight and no pairing. It was pretty much diving in the ice-covered deepend. Yelling at the tool was mostly a way to let my frustration out.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You could try setting up a main function that calls a draw function, which they can then modify. Then have them run it. That way they only need to change code in one area, and each time they run the code they can see how it changes.

</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s my opiniated reply:</p>

<p>I would work through the book <em>Turtle Geometry: The Computer as a Medium for Exploring Mathematics</em>. See (<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/turtle-geometry">http://mitpress.mit.edu/books/turtle-geometry</a> ). The language used is a pseudo-LOGO. LOGO is a great &quot;low floor - high ceiling&quot; language - it&#39;s just a dynamic Lisp with non-Sexp grammar. After getting through as much of the book as a 12-14 year old can (it gets advanced towards the end) I would let the child choose and direct their own learning and support when needed.</p>

<p>The details (control flow and variables) of any language come pretty easy and should not be the end goal. The slogan should be &quot;programming to learn, not learning to program&quot;. </p>
</div><div class="md"><ul>
<li>Assuming it will work. </li>
</ul>

<p>A computer is stupid and you&#39;re going to make a lot of assumptions on how it <em>should</em> work. The computer will only do as you tell it, and will not put in any more effort than it has to. eg: if you were to make a platform game and told the playerObject to move vertically on a keypush, it will continue to move up on each subsequent keypush because you haven&#39;t told the playerObject to return to the ground.</p>

<ul>
<li>Your comfort zone is your enemy</li>
</ul>

<p>Your comfort zone is your little safe place. If you&#39;re finding things too easy, you aren&#39;t learning - step outside and allow yourself to be frustrated.</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Write some code!</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Dirty, tangled code, is better than no code. If it works: brilliant! Now you can look at cleaning it up a little and figuring out alternate, cleaner ways of doing things.</p>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s something you have to stick with. You will feel frustrated, you might even feel defeated, but that&#39;s usually a good time to step away from it and allow yourself to cool down.</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m curious. Why <em>did</em> it hate you?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Does for me. Probably doesn&#39;t for everyone.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You think you can learn the basics of C++ in a few hours? And by the basics I mean pointers, arrays, overloading operators, memory management and the like? May I ask how long you&#39;ve been coding for?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Pretty cool but it breaks down quickly.</p>

<p>Firstly, you have people copy a file that&#39;s been deleted (you <code>rm sample.txt</code> before you make a copy) then you move the same non existent folder to <code>testFolder</code>.</p>

<p>Second you jump into some more advanced things with no explanation. There is no explanation of why <code>;</code> allows you to run multiple commands on the same line and the same goes for the use of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. Also there is no explanation of date formats.</p>

<p>Third there are 2 major shell features that are missing that make things annoying. One is that you don&#39;t have the current working directory in the shell prompt, which is annoying and contrary to the default configuration of almost every shell. Two there is no command history which makes retyping some of the complex steps annoying. I know it would not be easy to implement a functioning history but at the least see if you can eliminate the arrow keys printing control characters.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong learning by doing is great and it&#39;s how I learn best but there still needs to be an explanation of why what you are doing works so that you can learn how to apply the concepts outside of the examples given.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d suggest discussing the <em>logic</em> is more important than asking what to tap out in your IDE of choice. On the offchance somebody does just say &quot;yeah, do this&quot;, then it&#39;s time to look at it and find out <em>why</em> it works. Even when something is handed on a plate, it can be a valuable learning tool.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very important early on in a programmers learning process to discuss implementation with people who know better, although it just takes a quick glance over at StackSocial to see how that can be abused.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I definitely want to be showing them how to apply forces like gravity and wind to things, and other math based stuff.  I also want them leaving with a good feel for what&#39;s possible with OOP if possible (I&#39;ll have to look into it more).  Data structures and arrays are also great to understand.  I want it to be fun, but with a bit of depth.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry, I can explain more in future videos but when I mean beginner I mean beginner to GAME PROGRAMMING I assume you know basic C++ and it isn&#39;t hard, get a book look at it for a few hours, practice the code and that&#39;s that. At least it was for me. I am a very fast learner. Thank you for at least sharing you opinion and I will more thoroughly in future tuts. I am sorry for not being so clear. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>IMO it can be almost any language, from C, to PHP, to Javascript, to Python, etc.</p>

<p>The important thing to teach kids is how to solve problems, not the language to solve it in. The language is a tool to do that (and we all pick the best tool for the job, right?). That is one of the big problems with classes like the AP CS class. For the most part it just focuses on how to learn Java, and not how to solve problems (i.e. algorithms).</p>

<p>Again, my two cents, for what it is worth.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Came here to say this. They want you to pass the array as an argument, not monkey patch the array class.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>TBH, the first one is the commonly used approach anyway.</p>

<p>The second one is a crutch for special purposes, but it also works flawlessly.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I hate C personally - all that memory management :(</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m only a couple minutes in but I am already not sure who the scope is of the tutorial. You don&#39;t mention how to setup the IDE or compilers, after merely one minute you start talking about functions without even having touched on basic C++ syntax.</p>

<p>I appreciate the effort of making a tutorial, but do you really think that making a game is a good entry point, especially for C++?</p>

<p>This video is clearly not intended for beginners as it touches really fast on concepts that are not suitable for beginners. And this video is clearly not intended for advanced programmers as you say &quot;not to worry about arrays, we&#39;ll do that later&quot;. </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> To me this seems like one of those watch-video-copy-code tutorials that don&#39;t really benefit anyone in actually learning C++. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think I&#39;ll still use the first idea, since the size of the array is a private variable in the class, I can also use the counter to tell if I need to change the size of the array as well.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s fantastically dependent on what language you&#39;re learning. I&#39;ve been recommended by smarter people than me to read the Riak Core source for Erlang learning purposes.</p>

<p>And to answer everything else, look at other large or successful repositories, or even just look at random repositories made by any company or organization that would probably have good standard practices. Definitely include a README, and just be straightforward in it. Say what the project is, what it does, maybe why someone should use it over something else, maybe how it does things, and, most importantly, how to use it. Also include licensing information (even just point to where the license is, which should be in the top level (root) of the repository).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re plan is to make money off of an open source program, you might want to look at the RedHat way of doing that.

</div><div class="md"><p>I guess that wasn&#39;t the best phrasing. What I meant is that I&#39;m confident that everything with the encryption part of it works as I intended at the moment. As for the reuse of the IV, I wasn&#39;t sure of a better way to do it since the data isn&#39;t always encrypted in the same order.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s huge. There used to be some study people would cite, I&#39;ve spent hours looking for some mention on the web without success, but the idea was that writing by hand causes the information to be linked in different areas  of the brain, notably both left and right cortical areas, but also involving motor signals, visual, and high level processing. This was fifty years ago, as I said, can&#39;t find mention of it now, but it&#39;s rather surprising how much perfectly valid information from even just twenty years ago exists but is unfindable on the web, at least with currently available search tools.  </p>

<p>At any rate, perhaps my own experience has been altered by the thousands of hours I&#39;ve spent writing notes in lectures. Or maybe not, I never wrote a note of any sort until grad school, yet the effect is startling. I might mention that at least for me and others of my generation, working through any sort of mathematical thinking is hugely augmented by handwriting the steps as opposed to typing them on a screen.  </p>

<p>With learning programming languages, those are mostly not so well adapted to handwritten notes, but now that you mention it, I oughta try doing more of that. Wait, actually now that I get to thinking about it, I do take handwritten notes when listening to lectures. And it is helpful.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You can get the big-O complexity of OPs algorithm using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime-counting_function">prime counting function</a>.  Not the usual big-O analysis but it is doable.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The first thing you need to know about big-Oh is that there is a lot of notation abuse going on for the sake of making the writing shorter.  Let&#39;s look at the two most common notation abuses:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not being explicit about functions.  O(n) is actually an abreviation for O(n ↦ n) (meaning a function that takes input n and returns n).  Most often, we implicitly assume that the input argument is n, and just give the right-hand side of the function.</li>
<li>Using = instead of ∈.  O(f) represents a <em>set</em> of functions (formally, O(f) = { g | forall n &gt;= n0. exists c0. g(n) &lt; c0*f(n) }).  For instance, O(n ↦ n) is a set that contains the functions <code>n ↦ n</code>, <code>n ↦ 2n</code>, <code>n ↦ n/2 + 7</code>, etc.  Therefore, it makes more sense to say that the running time of an algorithm is an element of O(f) rather than say that it is equal to O(f).</li>
</ol>

<p>Next, to know how to apply big-Oh notation to your own code, you need to know what <em>n</em> is (i.e. the size of the input that can change).  An easy case are collections: as you have more elements, <em>n</em> gets bigger.  As to getting the growth function, you need to look at how many basic operations are performed.</p>

<p>If you have a function to find the maximum element of a list, that is O(n) because you will inspect each of the <em>n</em> elements once.  If you have a function that does three things for every element, it may be tempting to say O(3n), but O(3n) = O(n), so we still say O(n).</p>

<pre><code>    def find_max(elems):
        curr_max = -inf
        for elem in elems:
            curr_max = max(curr_max, elem)
        return curr_max
</code></pre>

<p>In the case of a function that would need to inspect every <em>pair</em> of items, that function has a running time of O(n<sup>2</sup>), for instance in the (naïve) function to find if two elements add up to zero:</p>

<pre><code>    def add_to_zero(elems):
        for x in elems:
            # Process n elements n times (n*n)
            for y in elems:
                if x + y == 0:
                    return True
        return False
</code></pre>

<p>As you add more and more nested loops that inspect the elements, the running time is in O(n<sup>2),</sup> O(n<sup>3),</sup> O(n<sup>4),</sup> etc.</p>

<p>You have to find your public IP ( <a href="http://www.whatismyip.com/">http://www.whatismyip.com/</a> ) and if it&#39;s static or dynamic (that is, do you get the same IP each time your modem/router reconnect?). Then you need to configure your router to redirect the port 80 of your public IP to the port 80 of your raspberrypi (that&#39;s where your private IP will be useful, also you must configure your router&#39;s DHCPd so it always gives the same private ip to your server...)</p>

<p>When it comes to encryption, even teams of experts have trouble with this. You should not be confident at all of its security without review by experts.

<blockquote>
<p>O(n<sup>2</sup> ) [grows] slower than O(2<sup>n</sup> ) after n=4.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not strictly correct- remember, big-O notation measures only the growth of the leading term, not any additional terms or constant multiplication.  So for example:</p>

<pre><code>9^9^9^9 * n^2 + (9^9^9^9)! * n + [Graham&#39;s number] * log(n)
</code></pre>

<p>is O(n<sup>2</sup> ), and </p>

<pre><code>(1 / [Graham&#39;s number]) * 2^n 
</code></pre>

<p>is O(2<sup>n</sup> ), but it&#39;s going to take an extremely large value of n for the second function to be larger than the first. (Note- Graham&#39;s number is a really, really, really big number)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Well, it depends on the size of the company/team. As team size increases, the cost of tooling becomes less important.</p>

<p>That said, we put every piece of code through a code review. Feature branches are a must. We have a tool that integrates with JIRA that will pull the code to a reviewer&#39;s box and allow them to interactively review it and make inline comments.</p>

<p>To answer your questions I&#39;d say: Reviewing in isolation at least the first pass is best because it gives a completely unbiased perspective. Gathering multiple people in a room seems prohibitively expensive unless it&#39;s an absolutely crucial/central piece of whatever you&#39;re working on.</p>

<p>Regarding strict vs. &quot;soft&quot; code reviews, that&#39;s a no brainer. &quot;Always accepting it&quot; made me uncomfortable. Why would you do that? What if there&#39;s a bug? Do you not have a coding standard? What if someone writes a function that has a space/time complexity that is significantly higher than is necessary?</p>

<p>In my experience, 90% of &quot;tickets&quot; (if you work that way) get rejected for something, whether it&#39;s minor or major. It&#39;s weird at first but eventually everyone just accepts/appreciates it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Every person is different, and your company/coworkers could have a different policy. But from my experience, you should target your git commit messages to actual goals completed. Such as whenever you implement a new feature, or fix a bug, however small they may be.</p>

<p>Also, remember that commit messages are the <em>why</em> -- the code diff will tell you the <em>what</em>.</p>

<p>So instead of &quot;Fix unescaped character in regular expression&quot;, you should write &quot;Fixed email detection bug in login module&quot; or whatever the reason for doing that was.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What!? You must be one of those <del>nit-pickers</del>people that also don&#39;t believe that hash tables are O(1).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Number of &#39;steps&#39;, where &#39;step&#39; technically refers to a step of computation on a Turing machine but can more usefully be thought of as an indivisible unit of operation in your program. A division can be thought of as one step. </p>

<p>The key here is that it doesn&#39;t really matter <em>what</em> precisely is being counted - it only matters how the time taken for your program to execute varies with respect to the size of the input. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Learning a language is not the same as learning to program. It&#39;s tempting and easy to learn the very basics of a language and then wander off to something else without ever actually learning how to do anything with it.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mainly because i keep getting bored with one language and move to the next.</p>

<p>Are you sure bored isn&#39;t actually hitting the wall where you realize you still don&#39;t actually know quite how to do anything useful?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The code seems to be a bit longer but it&#39;s also a lot more efficient.  I learned something this morning.  Thanks </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>And because in Perl, There Is More Than One Way To Do It:</p>

<pre><code>perl -e &#39;foreach(&quot;111040154157166145040171157165015012&quot;=~m/(.{3})/g){print chr(oct($_))};&#39;

</div><div class="md"><p>What are you counting? Number of divisions?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, that makes sense now. I was interpreting it the way you were.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Then, if I understand you correctly, I&#39;d go in the direction of kernel programming, or driver programing. Three options:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build an OS from the scratch. Progress is slow.</li>
<li>Modify/add-to an existing real, but educational OS. xv6 is a good choice. Can run on real hardware or in emulation (VM). Doesn&#39;t have the hugeness and complexity of a production OS such as Linux, but yet is very real.</li>
<li>Modify/add-to a real, production OS such as Linux. Complex, might not be very fun or educational.</li>
</ol>

<p>I personally would probably go with number 2, but it&#39;s a personal choice.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>lets really consider the &quot;beginner&quot;. Most likely they are going to start with something that is thought of as a &quot;beginner&quot; language. Like Python or in my case, Ruby. Python comes preinstalled and ready to go on almost every linux distro I have ever seen. Ruby/Rails isn&#39;t ready fresh out of the box but it doesn&#39;t take too much to get a RoR and database up and running quickly. Also, we seem to be ignoring the biggie coder elephant in the room Git. You&#39;re gonna use git... you just are. So... Python, Ruby, Rails, &amp; Git all those are becoming beginner go-tos (and rightly so!) and they can SUCK to learn on a windows machine. Truthfully, I have NEVER seen a RoR environment on windows. Legend has it, it can be done... but I&#39;ve never seen it. Alternatively, you could use a mac and that seems to be what I see most new devs learning on. That was what I used to learn. Quick, easy and LOTS of documentation... but that all comes at a very literal price$$$ Personally, I love my linux machine and its my go-to computer now. I know enough to really traverse it quickly, but mac IMHO is also a perfectly acceptable route as well. As the learning goes deeper, I believe the path inevitably leads to Linux. So ya might as well start there right? </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Having read through this book myself, a lot of the focus was on making your code concise, readable, and reusable. It does have some good insight into design practices, because part of software engineering is understanding what constitutes good design and what does not.</p>

<p>There are some good code examples in the book, and there&#39;s an entire section focused on practicing with your ability to refactor things into smaller methods. The author is, himself, a contributor to an open source project and very knowledgeable. All of the source examples he provides are in Java.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Finding the mth prime number is a bad example of big O notation because if you&#39;re iterating through each integer, the time taken for your program to execute is mostly dependent on the distribution of primes and not on the complexity of your algorithm. </p>

<p>A better example is an algorithm for &quot;is m prime&quot;. In this case, using the trial division prime algorithm, you can observe that each time you add one bit to m, the amount of time required for the algorithm to run doubles on average. Because of this, the complexity of trial division is exponential (O(2<sup>n))</sup> where n is the size of the input (measured in bits).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Pretty bad prof if they&#39;d mark down for using descriptive names.</p>

<p>Descriptive names are a good idea when they exist, eg, <code>encryptionKey</code> instead of <code>e</code>. One particular reason for using descriptive names is ensure readability for other people. Sure <em>you</em> know what it means now, but would someone else (no, as the top comment makes clear)? Will you in several months? Even if it doesn&#39;t necessarily apply to this particular snippet, it&#39;s simply a good practice in general, which is why <a href="/u/Magixxxx">/u/Magixxxx</a> brought it up.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m saying is that you don&#39;t draw up a <em>plan</em> for a relatively large project, and then code it perfectly in one shot from that plan. You&#39;re saying that Knuth coded TeX on paper. Did he do this from start to finish with no amendments or alterations? In other words, the medium for constructing the code (paper, punch cards, a text editor) is immaterial to the point I&#39;m trying to make.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You have to find what the most important command is and how often it is executed. For example, if you have a nested loop and each loop is repeated n times : O(n<sup>2).</sup> If there is recursion you will probably have O(nlogn).

</div><div class="md"><p>DevOps is not a role, it is a philosophy. It just means fostering a tighter collaboration between developers and operations (systems). Traditionally, developers write code, and systems folks manage server hardware. The DevOps philosophy blurs the line as operations professionals begin to be expected to automate their infrastructure beyond tried and true shell scripting so that it reacts dynamically to the needs of the code written by frontend/backend developers and customer demand (this is what scalability means). This is great if you&#39;re like me and lucky enough to work with a team of bright developers who take the resource limitations of the physical infrastructure (disk, I/O, memory) into account, but an unending headache if you work with developers who waste resources like memory or disk in poorly optimized code.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/javahelp/wiki/code_guides">Tutorial on how to post code</a>. It&#39;s for Java, but applies in the same way with C# code, only the <code>.java</code> extension needs to be replaced with <code>.cs</code> and the <code>Java</code> formatting needs to be replaced with <code>C#</code> formatting.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really not all that difficult.</p>

<p>BTW: your code on <em>gist</em> does not have the method line that you referred to. This is not the code that you posted in the screenshots.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t there a way more efficient way to do this?</p>

<p>Let n be the number, compute n/3 and n/5 using integer division (i.e. round down, floor whatever you want to call it) - in Python this can be done by doing int(n/3) and int(n/5)</p>

<p>Then calculate the multiples of 3 up to int(n/3) and the multiples of 5 up to int(n/5) adding them to a list. Use a for loop for this - you could even store the numbers 1 to n/3 (or n/5) in a vector to vectorise (which IIRC benefits from  SIMD or use some other parallelisation thing like multiple cores) if n was <em>really</em> big.</p>

<p>Both solutions are O(n) but using integer division and calculating the multiples directly has a much smaller leading constant than brute force comparisons.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just as a side note: in this specific case Python behaves exactly like C and will return 0 if you stick to integers...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The code snippet from <a href="/u/the_omega99">/u/the_omega99</a> is pretty much the standard convention for Java constructors.</p>

<p>Some people advise against it, but since Oracle (the company that took over from Sun who were the creators of Java) uses it all the time in their documentation, I would stick to this standard.</p>

<p>It&#39;s easy to read (especially the parameter side of the method), perfectly clear to see what it does.</p>

<p><code>this</code> is properly used in the above case as it makes it clear that the variable referenced belong to the class.</p>

<p><code>this</code> shouldn&#39;t be used everywhere, but in the above case, and in the case of <code>setter methods</code> it&#39;s absolutely correct.</p>

<p>Your code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>airplane = setAirplane;
departureCode = setDeparture;
destinationCode = setDestination;
</code></pre>

<p>Totally goes against common naming conventions since &lt;verb&gt;&lt;noun&gt; combinations are used for <em>methods</em>, not for <em>variables</em>.</p>

<p>The snippet:</p>

<pre><code>airplane = startingAirplane;
departureCode = startingDeparture;
destinationCode = startingDestination;
</code></pre>

<p>Would imply that the variables <code>startingxxx</code> have a special meaning, i.e. that they are only valid for <em>starting</em>, and invalid for everything else. They basically restrict the meaning of the class variables.</p>

<p>I&#39;d probably phrase this differently. If you don&#39;t <em>understand</em> things you are supposed to be working on after a year, you <em>might be</em> incompetent.

<p>Yes, going from a front-end to a back-end might seem daunting at first, if you deal with <sup><sup>e.g.</sup></sup> sockets for the first time (even if you have been coding for a while).

<p>This is a bit of a tough question. Especially in web dev (and frontend particularly), keeping up with industry trends and tinkering with new tools is definitely a must. I wouldn&#39;t say writing code in your free time is a must, but it certainly helps if you want to be a sr. dev one day.</p>

<p>On the other hand, don&#39;t presure yourself into wasting all of your free time on this. A lot of devs decide to forget about work-life balance and consequently end up completely burnt out. Don&#39;t let yourself believe you&#39;re immune to it.</p>

<p>Well, they seem confident and incredible mainly because they&#39;re just a lot more experienced than you are. Maybe you are mising some confidence in yourself, but that will come on its own when you have the knowledge to back the confidence up.</p>

<p>will I need to use a SQU and SSL language? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Haha... I suspect that you meant &quot;SQL&quot;, as there&#39;s no SQU language, as far as I know. SQL is usually a requirement (although there&#39;s alternatives) for a database and many dynamic sites will need databases (particularly if you want to store some kind of user created content, such as how many upvotes this post has).</p>

<p>SSL isn&#39;t a language. It refers to the encryption protocol used for websites that has since been replaced by TLS. Basically, it&#39;s for when you want to encrypt the traffic to your web server, preventing someone from spying on said traffic. The current model conveniently also allows us to verify that you reached the server that belongs to the site you&#39;re trying to connect to.</p>

<p>Anyway, you don&#39;t need that at all. It&#39;s optional, but a good idea if you have to send private information to or from clients. It&#39;s also a must if you run a website that needs to be trusted, as the certificates can provide proof that you connected to the right site.</p>

<p>As for how you&#39;d setup a site to allow HTTPS, you basically need to get a certificate (which is basically a key that you must keep private) and have to do a little bit of server side configuration (I&#39;ve only done it once, so I don&#39;t remember the steps). Setting it up isn&#39;t too hard. There&#39;s not really anything programming-y involved. It&#39;s more like sysadmin work.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You are stuck in an infinite loop because you never create a new random number inside the loop.</p>

<p>But another issue is that I had the wrong problem description.</p>

<p>In another comment, you quoted:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Must use a nested loop control structure that randomly generates a candidate number and compares it with all previous numbers in that row until it finds one that will fit. It will ALWAYS find a value that will fit eventually.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Which completely changes the rules and hence makes my code unnecessary.</p>

<p>You only need to check for duplicates in the <em>current row</em>, so that&#39;s even easier to achieve. No need for the extra array, a simple loop will do.</p>

<p>Given the quoted constraints, the following code will work:</p>

<pre><code>    int numb;
    bool unique; // Flag to check if the number already is in the current row

    Random rnd = new Random();
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; arr2d.GetLength(0); y++) // loop through the rows
    {
        for (int x = 0; x &lt; arr2d.GetLength(1); x++) // loop through the columns
        {

            do {
                // Always assume the generated number is unique
                unique = true;

                // generate a random number
                numb = rnd.Next(1, 10);

                // are we trying to place the first element in the row?
                if (x==0) { // Yes, means that the number is surely unique
                    unique = true;
                }
                else { // not the first element in the row
                    for(int i = 0; i &lt; x; i++) { // loop through the previous elements
                        if (arr2d[y,i] == numb) { // check if the number is already in the current row
                            unique = false; // if so, it&#39;s not unique
                            break; // no need to continue checking, exit the loop 
                        }
                    }
                }
            } while(!unique); // loop as long as the number is not unique

            // We have a unique number, place it in the array
            arr2d[y, x] = numb;

</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re welcome. I&#39;m not sure how far the analogy holds true, but I think it helps explain a lot of phenomena. Like why it takes a while before you can wrap your head around new concepts like OOP. Because OOP itself consists of a network of many foreign concepts that only really make sense when you&#39;re able to see the big picture. Since we have to learn little by little, there will be a period of time where the brain is very limited in how well it can process and retain the information. This is where people give up. But if you keep thinking about the new concepts, new connections will begin to appear (e.g. <em>Eureka, now I totally see how Inheritance and Encapsulation play together to make infinitely flexible data structures</em>).</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s these small eureka moments that keep us going through the endless nights of uncertainty and confusion. In fact I believe that (1) How well a person copes with uncertainty and confusion and (2) How much pleasure they gain from discovering connections between bits of information (eureka moments), is way more important than raw IQ (which I currently think of as an analogy to CPU clock frequency). You have to be fearless in the face of the unknown and willing to suffer long periods of confusion and doubt, if you want to achieve anything great in any aspect of life.</p>

<p>1- it ends up being just like something that has already been done, Or i see another game that has just done what i wanted to do,only it&#39;s better and then why bother doing it, if its already been done before.</p>

<p>2 - My plans are much bigger than my skill.. I dream up these projects that seem simple at heart, but it always end up being huge.... then abandon it.

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll vouch for VSCE. It&#39;s a great platform to learn the language on, since the project system handles building for you and the visual debugger makes it very easy to see what your program is doing.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The reason to use functions is to break out code that you want to use in many different places with different variables and generalize it into a one-line call, with replacing the variable as easy as passing a different one to the function as a parameter.

<p>As for the snippet of code you posted, it&#39;s not calling the function because you&#39;re not telling it call the function. Given by the lack of compiler errors, I&#39;m going to assume you&#39;re using GCC. The line</p>

<pre><code>int scan(void);
</code></pre>

<p>in your main function is defining a new function called scan that takes no parameters and returns an int. GCC supports an extension of C (that is not a part of the official standard) that lets you nest functions. </p>

<p>To call a function, you don&#39;t need to repeat the return or parameter types, just pass it the parameters you want it to use, which in this case is nothing, so</p>

The ones who end up Sr. Devs end up in that position because they keep up with the technology and play around on their own time and keep learning.</p>

<p>That said when it comes to cut the fat your also the first ones to go as well so that is something to think about as well.  Often they might hire Jr Devs knowing they are not planning on keeping you past 6 months to a year, they just want you for the major coding stages and when the product is out the door so are you, yet they will never tell you that when they hire you.

</div><div class="md"><p>&quot;Learning hex&quot; isn&#39;t really a thing.  Hexadecimal means nothing more than the fact that you&#39;re using base sixteen to represent integers, as opposed to the traditional base ten.  You can represent integers in any base, but in the context of representing binary data, using a base that is a power of two has the added benefit of not wasting any digits.  00 - ff looks more pleasing to the eye than 000 - 255, but they both represent the same range of integers.</p>

<p>That&#39;s it.  You&#39;ve now learned everything there is to know about hexadecimal.  I&#39;m not trying to be flip here, I&#39;m trying to help you understand that hexadecimal has virtually nothing to do with what you&#39;re asking.  It&#39;s the smallest and most irrelevant of details.  To edit a ROM you would have to know a ton of vital information, like what values are stored at what offsets; how those values are encoded; what effect editing them will have; how the code is structured; how the hardware is designed; what instructions it uses; what secondary hardware controllers (e.g. sound, video, etc.) exist and how they work; and so on.  Maybe this information has already been determined by someone and you can just look it up somewhere, or maybe you will need to determine it yourself by spending thousands of hours reverse-engineering how the code works by single-stepping in a simulator, or by attempting to randomly change things and seeing what happens.  Those are all the things you need to research, not hexadecimal.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Because you&#39;re hitting the limit for double precision. Doubles are 64-bit numbers storing what&#39;s essentially scientific notation (specifically, it&#39;s of the form <em>a * 2<sup>b</sup></em> where <em>a</em> is 53 bits  and <em>b</em> is 10 bits, with 1 bit for the sign). They only have about 16 digits of precision. Once you get above 10<sup>16,</sup> not every number can be accurately represented as a double.</p>

<p>The reason the Python code works is because Python is using arbitrarily-sized integers. If a number can&#39;t fit in a 64-bit integer, Python makes a 128-bit integer. If you want to get a similar behavior in Java, you have to use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html">java.math.BigInteger</a> instead of a long or a double.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>this is awesome advice, applicable to many - not just beginners.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So what is the code supposed to do, and what does it actually do?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yep, that&#39;s great advice. And I think the idea holds not only for bugs, but also just for the fact that there will be differences between how the code you write now looks, vs. what you&#39;ll deliver as a &quot;final product.&quot; Trying to create code that <em>looks</em> perfect and elegant from scratch could bring a project to a complete stand-still. It&#39;s best to make something work first, and then worry about making it elegant later. Ditto for optimization. Make it work now, and worry about making it as fast as possible later (you may, in many cases, realize that a feature doesn&#39;t actually need to be as fast as possible, because it&#39;s current speed is just fine for pretty much any potential use case).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not sure if this helps at all. It&#39;s just anecdotal, and maybe it only makes sense to me... </p>

<p>To make a CS analogy, your knowledge and understanding of programming (and any other topic) is organized in a graph-like data structure. Some nodes (representing a single piece of information) are linked to many other nodes, while others (especially new and novel information) have very few - or none at all. </p>

<p>Our short term memory seems to be capable of keeping track of only a few &quot;lone&quot; nodes, and if they&#39;re not accessed enough, they will eventually fade away like a memory address that no-one ever references. The information might still theoretically be there, but for all practical purposes, it is not.</p>

<p>This obviously takes place partly on a subconscious level, but in my experience, it is possible to apply <em>some</em> conscious control to the process.</p>

<p>The trick is to train yourself to become aware of those moments when nothing in your past experience helps make sense of what you&#39;re looking at. Because those are the moments where you can do a concious effort to <em>accommodate</em> this new information. Maybe you need to install a few intermediary nodes in your knowledge, or maybe you need to remove a misconception or two. But once you&#39;ve linked the new information with other nodes you have confidence in, the new information will become part of you. Recalling it will be effortless, because you haven&#39;t just stored a value at an arbitrary address.</p>

<p>Fortunately it&#39;s not hard to recognize the moments where extra effort is required. They are always accompanied by the feeling we call confusion. Don&#39;t try to avoid confusion. Embrace it. It&#39;s just your brains way of letting you know that it&#39;s dealing with the unknown.</p>

<p>That&#39;s about enough wisdom for a Sunday morning. I&#39;ll see myself out.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Yes, but only so far as it forces you to try to link new information with your existing knowledge.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the suggestion! I did some reading and it looks fantastic (<a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/19354/Quick-C-CLI-Learn-C-CLI-in-less-than-minutes">this</a> article was very helpful in wrapping my mind around it). </p>

<p>What I&#39;m not sure of, however, is how to bind a C++/CLI function or event to a C# event. That might not be the correct terminology though; I&#39;m still trying to figure that out.</p>

<p>I&#39;m basically trying to get a C# function (bound as a callback) to trigger a C++/CLI callback, which will trigger a native C++ callback, passing some data down the line. So I can at least search for the right keywords; what is this concept called? </p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Ive only been programming for about a year.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s why. You don&#39;t have the practical nor the theoretical background to get it yet. </p>

<p>It&#39;s really simple.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not about the tools, it&#39;s about the ability to solve problems and being able to find the tools to fit the solution you have in mind. So yea, obviously simple (lol /s)</p>

<blockquote>
<p>haproxy, load balancing, makefiles, server stuff, yaml files, docker, other cli </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know what make files are (great tool) and I probably know about load balancing and &quot;server stuff&quot;, but fuck if I care what haproxy, yaml, etc are. Those are just some tools. If I needed to, I could spend time searching the net and reading documentation until I understand one or all of them, but only if I need them. If you feel you&#39;ll need them, then go read up.</p>

<p>Also, if you&#39;re just curious, go ahead and try to find a way to use that tool and make sure to really understand the problem you&#39;re solving with it. Over time, you may notice a set of common problems; that&#39;s kind of what theoretical training is about, learning about a set of solutions and problems that are common to software engineering.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing you get an error if you click &quot;Run Tests&quot; without defining any tests (or if your tests contain errors).  I defined some actual tests and it works fine: <a href="http://cl.ly/image/1Q232H1m1j3b">http://cl.ly/image/1Q232H1m1j3b</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Linux is used on a lot of web servers. Since there are a lot of programming jobs that center on web development it would make sense to learn this skill. Just because you aren&#39;t the sysadmin, it doesn&#39;t mean you won&#39;t be required to know about the operating system.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yup. Almost any language can be. The only requirement is the ability to run the language (or a compiled result) on the server and interact with clients via HTTP.</p>

<p>For example, I currently work with the Play Framework, for example, using Scala as a backend language. I&#39;ve also worked with servers that use Java, Python, and PHP.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Awesome! Thanks for the reply! Just to clarify, Java, Python, PHP, C++ are some examples of server-side languages? If I know some of these languages, does this mean I can be a backend developer for a website?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No. When I mention JS here, I refer to client side JS. It runs in the browser. It&#39;s essentially the only programming language that browsers support (there&#39;s also Flash and Java applets, but they actually use plugins and don&#39;t have the same capabilities that JS has).</p>

<p>So for client side scripting, JS is the only choice. There&#39;s also some languages that compile into JS, like CoffeeScript and TypeScript. As you can imagine, they&#39;re very similar to JS, anyway.</p>

<p>PHP is a server side language. Most of the flak it gets is for the inconsistent conventions that it has. Almost any language can be used as a server side language. The reason PHP got so popular in the first place is because it&#39;s meant to be a server side language, and has features that make it easy to get running as such. Eg, once a server is setup for PHP development, you can just put a PHP script somewhere and directly access it in a web browser. It&#39;s not so simple for most other languages (although PHP&#39;s simplicity comes at some costs).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="/r/cringepics">/r/cringepics</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Could PHP be used as an alternative to Javascript? I know it&#39;s used for web development as well as a general purpose programming language but I hear some &quot;negative&quot; things about PHP. Do they both do basically the same thing?</p>

<p>Also, upvoted because I wanted Javascipt to send a request to Reddit&#39;s servers.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Have you considered using the api?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay thanks. I get it.  When the system.out.prinln lines were not in the curly braces, the variables were declared but had not values assigned to them. Putting them inside the if statement assigns a value to them if donationType&lt;2 and outputs an error message if the input is anything higher. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yup, redis is just a key value cache. Just to add, redis allows for atomic increments (meaning that you don&#39;t have to worry about race conditions) as well as a simple messaging functionality. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For languages, I tend to prefer to just learn by example and not take notes. For things like algorithms, maths, etc. I find taking notes indispensible. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So you&#39;ll be immortal, there&#39;s nothing wrong with that!  The undead are quite attractive to some.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Forget what everyone said and Google the Odin project.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah I have to do the imagination as well.  I like the idea of asking the user to continue I will add that to the code.  Thank you once again for all the help.  Also is there a way to have a user enter a function?  For example is it possible to write a code that simply tells the user the slope of a polynomial function like y=3x+2 or y=-2x+1.  Is there a data type that can store an entire function?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I forgot to post the formatMonom method, which takes care of this issue. If I have a string given as -x<sup>5,</sup> it will append 1 at the beginning so it will be 1x<sup>5,</sup> and only after this will it try to decompose the monomial. I&#39;ve tested the method for several input data and it worked every time. I&#39;ll take a look again, maybe there might be an isssue... Thank you for your answer!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks, that&#39;s helpful. Glad to hear it mirrors my approach so far.definitely have a ways to go, but sounds like I&#39;m on the right track.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>&quot;I can&#39;t do this&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t need to learn anymore&quot;  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I can see why people might have this response given the way OP wrote his post. That said, my interpretation is that of someone realizing for the first time in the beginning of their career that the people who go furthest are those that live and breathe this stuff during and after work. It can definitely be an eye opening experience, particularly for those with a bare minimum of interesting things to do in their current role. Not every job exposes people to interesting challenges.</p>

<p>Nothing wrong with that. However to the main point of your post...the first step is identifying your gaps (which OP has done). Next step is making the personal effort with great online resources to fill them (which OP May or may not have started to do yet).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Search for Visual Studio Community Edition.  </p>

<p>It&#39;s free, it supports C++, and is probably the best IDE for Windows.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>THANKS BRO! How couldn&#39;t notice it sooner, my array was a string. I made multiple intRandomNum-like to get different array element. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That really helps me get my head around it, so I&#39;m glad <a href="/u/redisquestion">/u/redisquestion</a> asked and I&#39;m glad you answered.</p>

<p>I had been thinking of redis as some kind of full-site caching system, which wouldn&#39;t seem to fit a lot of use cases.</p>

<p>But the way you describe it makes a hell of a lot more sense.  Like a twitter feed that&#39;s cached and only replaced when a new message is added, or something.</p>

<p>That sounds like very granular control, which could really come in handy.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can get away with a lot by using a cloud host like Heroku for free and knowing practically nothing...  You just need to know how to deploy, do some configuration.</p>

<p>I mean, it&#39;s another part of your tooling.  Familiarize yourself with networking and server administration at least a little.</p>

<p>You will need to debug or verify issues concerning those eventually.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What are you looking for? Info on how to use a compiler?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1lve0b/basic_stepbystep_c_getting_started/cc3b19v">I have a post detailing that here</a>. It&#39;s how to use the G++ compiler in the command line (my recommendation for starting out).</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend using Linux, as that would avoid the need to install a C++ compiler (Linux distros typically come with G++ pre-installed). However, the tutorial is Windows friendly and I made it from Windows. I recommended MinGW in that tutorial, but I would actually recommend <a href="https://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> now (can be installed with default settings to get everything you need).</p>

<p>Since that post uses the command line, you should also learn the command line to be effective. It&#39;s practically a requirement for programmers, anyway, and IMO, it&#39;s better to learn the command line sooner rather than later. <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/21pczf/i_want_to_learn_github_but_every_tutorial_i_found/cgfiy9i">I have a different post for learning the command line, here</a>.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I used redis on a project about a year ago. One part of the website was to have a stream of data that every user would see. We decided to use redis for this as it would be something that needed to be very quick and cachable.  We also wanted to just have to add to the steam instead deleting and recreating the cache every time we wanted to add something. With redis you can add items to a list and delete items from the end of it. </p>

    WHERE date &gt; UTC_DATE(); -- UTC_DATE() gets current date in ISO-8601 and no time zone
</code></pre>

<p>There&#39;s a lot of other date and time functions, too, so you could do something like increment all the dates that match some condition by 1 day.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Problem is that &quot;well written&quot; can vary. The Linux kernel has code that has been carefully maintained by a number of highly experienced programmers and is well documented. However, it&#39;s also highly complicated because of the fact that programmers try and squeeze out every ounce of performance, since the kernel needs to be as fast as it safely can.</p>

<p>Optimizing for performance can often make code more complicated and harder to read. Which is one major reason not to prematurely optimize code (another being that it wastes your time for potentially little benefit).</p>

<p>Most standard libraries are the same way. They could be a good choice if you want to see code that is well written while also trying to maximize performance. Nifty thing is that virtually every language has a standard library, so there&#39;s something in whatever language you want.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re into Java, the Apache Commons libraries are well written. JQuery has nice clean code. There&#39;s the previously mentioned Linux kernel (hell, most GNU code, while heavily optimized and complex, is well written).</p>

<p>Absolutely. I don&#39;t know a single successful programmer that doesn&#39;t spend many hours a week coding on their free time.</p>

<p>Employers swing a lot though as to whether they require that.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>While I haven&#39;t used Redis myself, I have used caches and I am under the impression that Redis is more or less just a cache.</p>

<p>Caches are meant to temporarily store data in memory to avoid the need to recalculate something that might be time consuming. For example, I&#39;ve had some work that has database tables which are essentially enums. They rarely change, but frequently had to be queried. Caching the access to drastically improved performance, because it cut out an unnecessary interaction with the database server (and since the database was on a different server, there&#39;s latency).</p>

<p>And of course, there&#39;s always the intensive calculations that could be cached. It really depends on your application. A cache isn&#39;t a substitute for a database meant for permanent storage, though. Caches usually are in memory only and will disappear if the server gets restarted. There&#39;s other things that can invalidate caches, too, such as too much time passing or manually invalidating them when you make a change.</p>

<p>EDIT: BTW, SQL is just a language (more specifically, it&#39;s a poorly followed standard for what&#39;s essentially a family of languages). A closer equivalent to Redis is a relational database management system, which executes SQL and maintains the database (most modern databases aren&#39;t directly accessed, but instead are accessed through the RDBMS or equivalent). For example, Postgres is an RDBMS that uses its own flavor of SQL to interact with it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think I actually should apologize -- I was feeling upset for unrelated reasons, and I think I ended up taking some of that out on you.</p>

<p>But anyways, to answer your question, developing websites like reddit or shopify is interesting in that it&#39;s simultaneously relatively easy yet potentially very difficult.</p>

<p>I think developing a fairly basic reddit clone should actually be more or less attainable to somebody with basic programming experience. Fundamentally, there really isn&#39;t a huge amount of complexity going on -- reddit is basically one big forum, and there are <em>tons</em> of tutorials out there you can follow and adapt to your own use case. If you already know Ruby and Rails, I think you should theoretically have enough knowledge to go out and make a basic reddit clone. The only other thing you&#39;d probably need to know about is databases and SQL.</p>

<p>Similarly, I don&#39;t think making a basic Shopify clone would be too difficult.</p>

<p>However, the difficultly starts setting in when you try making a <em>robust</em> clone. The two big things you need to consider are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Security. You need a login system for both websites -- are you 100% confident that it&#39;s completely secure? Computer security is a full-time occupation and career choice in its own right, and it&#39;s <em>very</em> easy to get security wrong by accident.</li>
<li>Scalability. Your reddit/shopify clone might work if you have only a few hundred or a few thousand users, but what happens if you suddenly start having over a million users? Over a hundred million? Can you grow your site, manage your data, maintain several different servers, keep things performant, etc., when you have several thousand to several million interactions with your site per second? This is where the CS theory you&#39;re learning can come in handy -- you need to have enough awareness to know what&#39;s efficient, what&#39;s not, and what approaches might be fruitful, and which approaches should just be avoided right off the bat.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a more comprehensive list of things you should be aware of when launching a website, see <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/46716/45762">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/46716/45762</a>. You definitely don&#39;t need to be aware of everything on that list, especially since you&#39;re a beginner, but it definitely does demonstrate just how potentially complicated even a seemingly basic website might be if you want to launch it professionally.</p>

<p>But all in all, I wouldn&#39;t be too overwhelmed. One of the cool things about the internet is that it&#39;s very easy for a beginner to jump right in and build something respectable, but there&#39;s always more things to learn, more things to try, and more things to improve on -- it&#39;s a constant learning process, and so it&#39;s very difficult to get bored!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think he/she/it is recommending a book.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Make sure that every path assigns a value to the variable. For example, in your else statement (where you print error), you could set the variables to &quot;N/A&quot; or something like that.</p>

<p>Other option would be to move the following</p>

<pre><code>System.out.println(&quot;You entered &quot; + donationType);
    System.out.println(&quot;The volunteer who will price this item is &quot; +
       volunteer);    
    System.out.println(&quot;This is &quot; + message);
</code></pre>

</div><div class="md"><p>Bah... makefiles, yaml files, docker... those are just things that make life easier.  You don&#39;t necessarily have to know much about them unless you want to, just how to use them.</p>

<p>haproxy, load balancing, server stuff - that&#39;s dev ops.</p>

<p>Lots of developers also do operations these days, which is cool, but that&#39;s networking not strictly related to what a person&#39;s role on a team may be.</p>

<p>You do eventually just pick stuff up.  Lots of stuff.  The pieces begin to connect.  Feels like a jigsaw puzzle at first, and still is, but the picture gets clearer.  Eventually, you&#39;ll be able to understand how everything works &quot;at a high level&quot; and some core details that let you explore topics in-depth when you need to.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s after a while...  Years.</p>

<p>Where I am, I kind of just do it on the side when I&#39;m a bit bored or don&#39;t feel like doing my normal job (whatever that is). So I have thrown things out and started over several times. So far this stuff hasn&#39;t been in &quot;production&quot; per se, but some things I&#39;m writing now will be. I made several projects that I probably could have rolled out, but didn&#39;t, just so I could learn. Looking at them next to things I&#39;m doing now... they&#39;re shit and I&#39;d re-write them if I was going to put them out. I don&#39;t think it would take too long to do, they are rather small and I know how things work much better now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t exactly know what I prefer, can you reference me to something that explains the basic of all this compiler business?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry, its fixed!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not necessarily. Depends on how &quot;unsorted&quot; the matrix is. For bubble sort, the maximum number of iterations is equal to the number of elements in the array. In this case, you can think of it as sorting 3 arrays in parallel, so the maximum number of iterations through the matrix is 3. The while loop with the boolean allows you to get out early if the matrix is sorted. In the case with the following matrix:</p>

<pre><code>335
146
457
</code></pre>

<p>We would go through, swap the 1 and the 3, then we wouldn&#39;t make any more swaps. The swapped variable would be set to true at the end of this iteration. The matrix would be:</p>

<pre><code>135
346
457
</code></pre>

<p>We would then set swapped to false and start the next iteration. The next time through, everything is in order, so we would never set the swapped variable to true. As a result, we would end the loop after only two iterations. </p>

<p>There is a <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/tools#wiki_c.2B.2B">list of recommended IDEs</a> in the FAQ. Most of them probably showed up in the first page of Google results. Have you tried to use any of them? What didn&#39;t work?</p>

<p>If you would prefer to use your own text editor, etc., and only want a compiler, <a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> is probably your best bet.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you! The book I&#39;m reading didn&#39;t really explain how nested for() loops works, so much appreciated. Those explanations makes it make much more sense.</p>

<p>You may find that once you get something decent, you look at your code and it now looks like a mess because you know more now. That is great. You&#39;re learning. Write again with these knew things you learned in mind to make a better version of the code/program.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Realistically if we&#39;re talking about something you did for work you&#39;re actually probably going to put this crap into production with a note at the top that says //TODO:  refactor this unreadable code</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Load balancing, configuration languages, virtualization, and build systems aren&#39;t industry trends.  HAProxy, YAML, Docker and Makefiles are specific implementations of those things (respectively), and might be labeled industry trends.  The former set of concepts are far more important than the latter.  When you are comfortable with the former you&#39;ll feel way more comfortable about the latter, even if you&#39;ve never heard of them!  This is good news because it means theres really way less to learn about to increase your confidence.</p>

<p>You are a front end developer so you probably know about stylesheets, right?  They work with rules (often cascading) to define how things are rendered.  You may be familiar with CSS, Sass or SCSS.  If someone comes up to you and talks about BSS, a new stylesheet language, you&#39;d probably be pretty comfortable with the conversation.  It&#39;s just a stylesheet, after all!  Knowing the syntax and ins and out of a new language is almost entirely useless, and no experienced developer would bash you for not knowing about it.  In fact, they&#39;d probably get excited to explain all those things.</p>

<p>To answer your questions more directly:  I don&#39;t think you are hurting yourself by not following industry trends or playing with new tools.  However, to contradict some of the sentiment in this thread, you may benefit significantly from programming on your own.  I&#39;d argue that you learn quite a bit when you do stuff on your own, including how to learn things (that sounds corny and meta, you really just learn how to google stuff).  I think it&#39;ll be a large boost to your confidence if you start working on stuff.</p>

<p>All in all, I would recommend you look for something to get passionate about, but not force yourself into anything.  You&#39;ll have a bad time and get burnt out if you choose to pursue something you don&#39;t care about.  In the mean time, wikipedia is incredible for learning about new things and finding new interests (see <a href="http://xkcd.com/214/">http://xkcd.com/214/</a>).</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>From what I read, i and J are being incremented at the same exact time they are being checked. So number[0] is being checked with user_number[0], number[1] to user_number[1] etc etc...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, that is not how nested loops work.</p>

<p>Actually, there&#39;s nothing special about nested loops. Think about how a <code>for</code> loop works:</p>

<pre><code>for (size_t i = 0; i &lt; user_number.size(); ++i)
    // loop body here
</code></pre>

<p>What does that loop do? It executes the <em>whole</em> loop body for <em>each</em> value of&nbsp;<code>i</code> from 0 to <code>user_number.size() - 1</code>. Whatever the loop body is, the <em>entire</em> loop body will be executed for <code>i == 0</code>, and then the <em>entire</em> loop body will be executed again for <code>i == 1</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, what is the loop body in this program? Well, the loop body is itself a loop:</p>

<pre><code>    for (size_t j = 0; j &lt; number.size(); ++j)
        // some stuff
</code></pre>

<p>If I execute that loop <em>once</em>, what does it do? It executes its own loop body for <em>each</em> value of&nbsp;<code>j</code> from 0 to <code>number.size() - 1</code>. The body of this loop will be executed for <code>j == 0</code>, and then again for <code>j == 1</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>So, if I use the <code>j</code>-loop as the body of the <code>i</code>-loop, what happens? The <em>entire</em> <code>j</code>-loop is executed for <code>i == 0</code> (i.e., when <code>i == 0</code>, the body of the <code>j</code>-loop will be executed for <code>j == 0</code> and <code>j == 1</code> and <code>j == 2</code> and so on), and then the <em>entire</em> <code>j</code>-loop is executed again for <code>i == 1</code> (i.e., when <code>i == 1</code>, the body of the <code>j</code>-loop will be executed for <code>j == 0</code> and <code>j == 1</code> and <code>j == 2</code> and so on), etc.</p>

<p>You aren&#39;t just getting <code>i == 0</code> and <code>j == 0</code>, and then <code>i == 1</code> and <code>j == 1</code>, because that wouldn&#39;t be the execution of the <em>entire</em> body of the <code>i</code>-loop on each iteration! The body of the <code>i</code>-loop contains the whole <code>j</code>-loop, so the whole <code>j</code>-loop is executed for <em>each iteration</em> of the <code>i</code>-loop.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah, seriously.  If you are gonna do work-related stuff in your free time I think reading some CS kind of stuff or working on stuff that has absolutely nothing in common with your usual work is the way to go, though.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So am I right in saying that the code you typed meant that we went through the loop 9 * 9 = 81 times since it was a 3x3 matrix? Once again, you were super helpful! Thanks. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>On the other hand, frankly, a lot of people in programming jobs are needlessly self-conscious and are actually doing fine.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>From what I read, i and J are being incremented at the same exact time they are being checked. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nope. Perhaps <a href="http://ideone.com/oPuc9t">this</a> will help demonstrate what&#39;s going on. When <code>for</code> loops are nested, the inner loop runs in its entirety once for <em>every</em> iteration of the outer loop.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>1.) When swapped becomes true, it doesn&#39;t go back to the start of the while loop. It keeps going and swapping values until it goes through the whole matrix. If another swap is made, the swapped variable will just be set to true again. The loop will only stop once the whole matrix has been gone through and there were no swaps. </p>

<p>I would read the wiki on bubblesort for more information. The crappy thing about bubblesort is you have to go through an array multiple times to actually sort it. Try it yourself. Write out an array with 5 or so numbers in it. Go through the array once, doing an iteration of bubble sort. You will find that the array is not sorted, and you will need to go through it several times (worst case 5 * 5 =25 times) for it to be sorted.</p>

<p>2.) Here is a good example of using getline/stringstreams: <a href="http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/strings/stringstream-example.html">http://www.fredosaurus.com/notes-cpp/strings/stringstream-example.html</a></p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t know much about the industry standard for this, as I haven&#39;t really found myself using user inputs. I work in the embedded world where the systems are mostly autonomous.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A lot of the difficulty comes if you don&#39;t have a compatible machine (Intel and nVidia or get out type deal) and the version of OS X you had available<br/>
From what I understand, all OS X versions after 10.6(?) are Intel only, and all before are PowerPC only<br/>
Assuming you can install the older OS X updating isn&#39;t terribly difficult (App store download then several hours of installing) up to 10.10 which is pretty good.<br/>
Also note that devoting anything less than 4GB of RAM to the VM is pretty much pointless if you were hoping of using 10.10, as Xcode and the OS are both power hungry. (Note this is coming from a Mac user on a proper piece of hardware)<br/>
Also if you&#39;re intending to develop apps for OS X/iOS, you&#39;d do good to invest in a little Mac Mini, they&#39;re cheap(Ha!, a grand!) and can run the apps natively.<br/>
Also note the actual user base for OS X is significantly less than windows (:c) so an iOS focus would be better<br/>
And even after all of this, I&#39;d recommend learning Objective-C as well as Swift (Objective-C is definitely a  scary language, but stick with it, it&#39;s good to learn) Xcode makes it pretty easy actually, once you get over things like stringByAppendingString (&lt;-- Why NeXT, Why)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have been trying for 40-50 minutes, so yes I guess it is that hard.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you want the full mac experience you should buy a mac.  You can get a second hand mac for ~500 dollars if you shop hard on craigslist.  If you look at xcode requirements they aren&#39;t that steep.  </p>

<p>To run the os in a VM you need a hacked version of the OS and a patch to apply to VM ware.  This is a legal gray area, but it clearly violates the EULA for the OS. </p>

<p>Best of luck.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a Java class that contains code that prints &quot;I love you&quot; to the screen.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I agree. But the <em>other side of things</em> is probably equally true..</p>

<p>It&#39;s also a bad idea to try to reinvent the wheel when many common programming problems that you&#39;ll run into have already been solved by someone else. </p>

<p>It&#39;s definitely important to try to think through problems before you start asking people to solve them for you, but it&#39;s also important to study and to be aware of existing, tried-and-true data structures, algorithms, design patterns, paradigms, etc.</p>

<p>The road to improving is probably equal parts studying and thinking critically and creatively.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Wow thank you, that was super helpful. I never even thought about having a while-loop to keep it going! Thanks! I have two further questions; </p>

<p>1) I&#39;m having a little trouble following the logic of the swapped value; in line 34, when swapped becomes true, it goes back to the start of the while loop. But then we set it back to false, and go through the loop again? So it only swapped 1 value? So technically we&#39;re going through the loop 9 x 9 times? </p>

<p>2) My professor says that the industry standard is to use getline / stringstream to get inputs...I&#39;ve used cin here because I couldn&#39;t understand how I would use getline/stringstream into an array, could you assist? (this is just additional knowledge that I would like to learn) Thanks, its much appreciated elpantalla.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>By output do you mean return from the function? When you pass an array to a function, you&#39;re passing it by reference, meaning that when you do the sort, you&#39;re modifying the same array that you are printing at the end. </p>

<p>In my experience it&#39;s best to first plan out your application.  What screens will it have,  buttons,  menus,  information displayed,  and then start the programming.  </p>

<p>A few years ago I did some very little android apps in my last year of college.  I&#39;m talking about applications with one screen and a few buttons,  like one tic tac toe. Then I stopped because my job didn&#39;t entail android dev and I spent my free time playing video games.  </p>

<p>I picked it up again last August with an idea I had. Since so much has changed I still had to do a lot of learning though. This is my first kind of big application,  but I applied what I learned from my job doing web development; have a plan. You don&#39;t have to stick with it,  but it&#39;s much easier to program with a plan,  than to program and think about what you&#39;re doing at the same. </p>

You either need to always work with people who are worse than you so you can feel awesome or you need to learn to stop comparing yourself to them.</p>

<p>But, back on topic -- totally agree, I revel when I get to explain stuff to people who don&#39;t know.

</div><div class="md"><p>There actually is a CS solution also, and that&#39;s called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_arithmetic">fixed point</a>. Basically, you put an implied decimal point in all your numbers. So:</p>

<pre><code>5 == 5000 x 10^-3
</code></pre>

<p>The 10<sup>-3</sup> is implicit. So you just multiple everything by 1000 when you read them in. When you output, just remember to divide again by 1000. If using C++, you can make a <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/fixed-point-arithmetic-types-for-c/184401992">class</a> to make it all transparent.</p>

<p>My coworker talks a lot about coding, but does very little of it.  And it shows in the little code he does output.  It&#39;s just crap.  Talking about programming doesn&#39;t make you a geek any more than talking about the latest episode of House MD makes you a doctor.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Software engineering is a massive field. You have barely entered it. Lack of knowledge about every possible subfield is not only normal, it&#39;s expected.</p>

<p>The &#39;Junior&#39; in your title is important, the best asset you bring to a team isn&#39;t experience and a wealth of knowledge, it&#39;s enthusiasm and drive. It&#39;s typical for guys like me, who&#39;ve been at this for a while, to become jaded and bored. We get tired of doing the same old same old every day. A junior dev, or an intern, who comes in all guns blazing ready to learn, ready to tear shit up and try to make things happen, that&#39;s downright invigorating. You&#39;ve got a while to learn all the ropes, right now it&#39;s best that you do two primary things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Learn your subfield (front end development) and learn it well. You&#39;ve got great resources, it sounds like, press them for information. Listen to what they say, learn from them -- and make it clear you appreciate it. Be enthusiastic and dive into hard problems, don&#39;t be afraid to ask for help. &quot;Junior&quot; means you don&#39;t know much of anything yet, the <em>best</em> thing you can do is ask for help. Try to present possible solutions for &#39;reality checks&#39;, get advice from those senior developers, let them teach you.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn about other subfields. Chances are you have a &#39;Devops&#39; dev -- they might not go by that title officially, they might call themselves &#39;the backend guy&#39; or &#39;the ops lady&#39; or something like. They&#39;re the people who will know all about the Haproxy/Load Balancing/Server stuff you&#39;re curious about (I&#39;m an Ops guy, though we go by &#39;Delivery Engineers&#39; in my neck of the woods). Similarly, you probably have a few devs who are really good at the code-layer -- not the servers and the metal they run on, not the front end users see, but the guys in the middle-end, doing all the interesting Database optimization work and fiddling with the data model. They&#39;re the folks who know what the business is and how it works. Bug them too, they know a <em>ton</em> of things you can learn. Remember you&#39;re important role -- to be enthusiastic and interested. That enthusiasm will drive everyone else to be enthusiastic and work better, be happier, and generally be a better team.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Some things you can ask:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ask your Team Lead if your company does lunch-and-learns, if not, ask if they can think about it, because you want to learn more about the different tools the company uses. Maybe offer to help organize them/find speakers. If you don&#39;t know what a lunch-and-learn is, I explained below (look for the [1]).</li>
<li>Ask your co-workers who are building those tools why they built them, and how they did it, and ask if they need help with any of them. Whether documentation or more testing or whatever, if you&#39;re interested, maybe you can contribute -- insodoing you&#39;ll not only help them out, but you&#39;ll gain a little personal capital with your coworkers, and you&#39;ll probably learn something interesting.</li>
<li>Be vocally positive about things you find interesting. If you see something neat that someone did, call it out. Ask them how they came up with the idea, what tools they used, etc. When I was a junior, I was in the habit of carrying a small flip-over notebook (like an old school detective) with a half-pencil stuck in the spiral binding. When I saw something neat, I pulled it out, asked what it was, what problem it solved, and what tools it used, and wrote down all the details in that notebook. Sometimes I would follow up and look up those tools, but ultimately what it did was help me make mental associations between a kind of problem, and tools and libraries that might be relevant. It <em>also</em> made the author feel really great about themselves. Here was this kid who was taking what they did seriously as a useful thing to learn, it makes them feel awesome, and that makes them happy, and that&#39;s worth it in it&#39;s own right.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR.</strong> Don&#39;t worry about what you don&#39;t know, instead, learn what you don&#39;t know, and then make it stuff you know. In the meantime, be enthusiastic and don&#39;t be afraid to call out things you think are awesome. Your best asset as a young programmer is to be enthusiastic and encouraging. Experience will come later.</p>

<p>[1] A lunch-and-learn is usually a company-sponsored lunch meeting (i.e., they buy pizza + provide a room to have it in) where one person, usually a team member, gets up and talks about some cool technology or tool they use, or know about. It can be related to the business, or just a cool thing. For instance, a recent lunch-and-learn I did talked about Docker containers and how they can be used for more than just servers.  I showed how we could package up our software build system in a consistent, cross-platform environment that would work the same on windows, linux, and mac, and have a clear and consistent way to version not only the build system code itself, but the environment it would need to operate in. This is really neat because other developers were given an opportunity to learn about a new tool and ask questions,  but it wasn&#39;t as formal as a lecture would be. I did a few demos, and answer a lot of questions by both Junior devs and a couple of Senior guys who were interested in employing the tool to solve some problems they were having with a particular tool they used to do static analysis, but that was really finicky to get set up in just the right way on everyone&#39;s platform. We actually spent part of the session trying to encapsulate it (and got a pretty good start, AFAIK they&#39;ve since got it working).</p>

<p>It&#39;s telling me &quot;Double cannot be deferenced&quot;</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Think about how to rearrange the formula so you aren&#39;t dividing 5 by 9 in one step.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes. I won&#39;t completely give it away, because I want you to think about it. But just go back to high school algebra. How can you rewrite the formula so you avoid 5/9. You can&#39;t eliminate division, but you can avoid a numerator that&#39;s smaller than the denominator.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re creating a string but not assigning it a value. I assume you want to convert the dots in the double to commas? You can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>String str=Double.toString(g).replace(&#39;.&#39;,&quot;,&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>This will convert the double to a string, and then replace all dots with commas.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>How did you land a job after only programming a year?!?! I would kill for a Jr. position just to get the opportunity to code all day.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I personally think the fault lays in who is looking. HR wants to see certifications or degrees because they demonstrate at least some knowledge of the topic at hand. That way, they can say they did at least some due diligence before handing you off for the technical interview.</p>

<p>You can hand HR your github account, but they have no clue what to do with that.</p>

<p>This is why I really dislike reddits hatred towards certification. A tech company where programmers are searching for programmers won&#39;t care, an enterprise with their own international programming will want to see that stuff.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A problem I have personally, is being in the mindset that I have to do everything quickly. Whether it be a book, online course, or project.. I hate spending time NOT working on stuff. Pace yourself and come up with a schedule or time frame for things that works best for you.</p>

<p>I always start a project and obsess over it until I&#39;m finished. My biggest issue and I&#39;m still not sure how to deal with it. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It really depends on the way you compile the source. If it&#39;s got a configure script, you can generally pass in the target architecture as an argument. If it&#39;s just got a makefile (but no configure), you can pass in the compiler you want to use. If you post a link to the git page, we can probably help you out easier.</p>

<p>Either way, you need to install the ARM compiler that the Pi uses. </p>

<p>Sure.  If you wanted, why couldn&#39;t you push a &quot;stub&quot; branch that references the ticket?  Or is the company rule that a commit which references a specific ticket automatically flags the ticket as closed/pending closure?</p>

<p>Not try to argue a point or anything.  Obviously however your team/company does it works for you all. :D</p>

Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved.

<p>... Yup. You should totally bail.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sure, but there are older languages like NATURAL, COBOL et al that simply don&#39;t do things in modern ways which are useless on a resume (unless you want to specialize in mainframe stuff and make big bucks as a consultant).</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason for knowing them now, but they are slowly being phased out and it would take a lot of work to get to the level of the other consultants that dominate the area.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I had that problem until I landed on Python. Even after I decided that python was the language I wanted to finally master; after the first week of reading dive into python, my interest dissipated. I eventually learned the basics and then started to skip between different things like Django, opencv, and many  others. I ended up working with ROS. Through this 9 month experience I realized that it wasn&#39;t the programming languages that I didn&#39;t like, it was the material. I would suggest that you look for an end game goal. In my case it was robotics, then find a language that will work. Take your time learning the basics of whatever you chose, break up lessons into 10-20 min stints. This will keep you from running out of steam half way through.  Eventually you will finish the prerequisites, then you will be able to start the thing you really like . After a couple of weeks or less, if you are still bored out of your mind programming is probably not your calling.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been maybe eight years but one of my proudest achievements as a programmer was when I coded, in Scheme, a source cross reference program for a Scheme. I coded it in Nano over a remote terminal and then ran the program on itself. It worked the first time.</p>

<p>Nothing ever works the first time.</p>

<p>Prior to writing the code in the terminal, I had written the entire thing on paper over about four days, as I remember. It wouldn&#39;t have worked the first time but I did all the verification in my head as I, slowly, wrote it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, JOINs feel a bit weird, sort of like XSLT transforms, they don&#39;t quite have the direct &quot;do this now and then this&quot; aspect of most programming...but they let SQL optimize the query for you and it is usually quite good at that, and they are the basis of any real SQL programming.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It really depends on the SQL optimizer, but in general a nested select statement like this will be unable to use optimizations like hash joins and indexed lookups. The database engine is most likely doing far more work than it needs to, because it has to store all the intermediate results either in memory or temporary database space. This is most likely overwhelming the database engine.</p>

<p>You should obviously use the JOIN clause instead. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.response_value, a.fk_intervention_id, a.fk_question_id
FROM responses a
INNER JOIN interventions b
ON a.fk_intervention_id = b.pk_intervention_id
INNER JOIN country_region c
ON b.fk_country_id = c.fk_country_id
WHERE b.fk_module_id = 4
AND c.fk_country = 25
AND b.year = 2013
AND a.fk_question_id in (119, 122, 100, 1363, 130, 119, 122, 125, 127, 126, 138, 140)
</code></pre>

<p>I have used a, b and c as aliases, but you can obviously use whatever aliases you want.</p>

<p>This structure is far more efficient, because the database engine can either hash the join columns or use index-only scans to match rows eliminating the need to store interim data. It may look complex, but the JOIN clause is actually quite logical. Also, if you ever find a need to use LEFT joins, the sub-select method will not work at all.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>wow you should be a guide counsellor, but probably should be nicer or same contact in nicer tone. your comment really helped me, it was like a wake up call so thank you:&gt; 
I have a silly question, please don&#39;t make fun of this on this but how much knowledge(Im currently in U2 SW eng) do I need to make a web application like reddit?or develop software like shopify? again I know this sounds silly, please don&#39;t be cynical.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Confidence. The smell of confidence should be coming out of you from your resume and during interviews. To have the confidence you need to build some applications on your own. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmm ok thanks! I&#39;ll need to go away and read up on JOIN as you say, so that I can better understand your advice. It&#39;s this topic I new was there in SQL but I&#39;ve been avoiding... time to bite the bullet.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What is the goal? To learn to program or to create a good looking resume? If you&#39;re looking at resume improvement then you should research what your local market is looking for. If you are trying to learn how to program then it doesn&#39;t matter what language you use since programming is about thought processes and problem solving. The language is just a tool.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh, I see. I was thinking region was smaller than a country. In that case your inner nested SELECTs might not be too bad, since the innermost one only returns one value (and writing JOINs against two instances of the same table is hard to read).  </p>

<p>Anyway rather than doing SELECT from x where y in (SELECT...) etc you want to write it as a join, like:
SELECT response_value, fk_intervention_id, fk_question_id FROM responses_submitted, interventions where responses_submitted.fk_intervention_id = interventions.pk_intervention_id and 
fk_module_id = 4 and fk_country_id in etc  </p>

<p>or maybe even join the three tables, so it&#39;s something like:  </p>

<p>SELECT response_value, fk_intervention_id, fk_question_id FROM responses_submitted, interventions, country_region where responses_submitted.fk_intervention_id = interventions.pk_intervention_id and 
interventions.fk_country_id = country_region.fk_country_id
and fk_module_id = 4 and fk_region id in (that inner select statement)  </p>

<p>It may complain about not knowing which table certain fields that appear only by name (like fk_module_id) are from, so you may need to make it interventions.fk_module_id; many versions of SQL also let you put shorter aliases to tables in the FROM statement and then use those when referring to fields, so you can say SELECT from tablefoo t where t.field = value (&quot;t&quot; is the alias in this case).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>wow this is a great idea. I&#39;ve got a little moleskin I keep notes in, but I actually haven&#39;t actually bothered to write out any full fledged guide, because I feel like i&#39;d be wasting my time if I spend too much time not working on my project...</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ll start doing this!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Turn that question around and start thinking in terms of what is the correct approach to programming (including learning). You will make mistakes. Learn from them and move on.</p>

So I need to check what the region of whatever country has been selected, and then find all the <em>other</em> countries in that region, and get the data for the interventions in those countries: hence the need to involve country_region to check the region required.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I know exactly what you mean lol. I did the same thing for a long time, I&#39;d try to stick with 1-3 languages you really like and or need. I use Ruby for scripts, Java for desktop apps, and dart for websites since I hate JavaScript. Use as many fun and cool APIs you need to build big goals.

</div><div class="md"><p>What programming language can I learn that will get me a high paying job the fastest?</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s all about doing what you love, but programmers who don&#39;t like programming usually aren&#39;t very good at it and taking a job just for the money can mean working on VB6 for the rest of your life, which is, if not a fate worse than death, then at least a fate that is not appreciably better.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>1) Yes, it is horribly inefficient.<br/>
2) There&#39;s this thing called JOIN, look into it.<br/>
3) Ignoring the crazy nested SELECT statements, why do you get the country_region table involved in this? It looks like fk_country_id is in interventions and you just want the ones where it is equal to 25?</p>

Just wait until you start working and that mysteriously &#39;removes some of the joy&#39; from that, too.  I&#39;d focus on the glass being half full: reasonable deadlines, learning new things, projects with clear requirements, no boss saying condescending things every time an image is out of place by 1 pixel, no douchebag coworker doing things you&#39;re supposed to do in a sprint and then sending emails to your boss pretending like you didn&#39;t know you were supposed to do it or that you weren&#39;t capable of doing it, no whole team bikeshedding about shit they have zero experience with, etc., etc.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d just make a list of everything you think you should know and spend ~15/20 minutes a day learning about one at a time. Over the course of a few weeks you&#39;ll know enough to start using different things in your own personal projects. Good luck!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No, you must have changed something else as well.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not going outside your comfort zone. If you only do what&#39;s easy for you, you&#39;ll never improve. That and worrying about every detail of implementation early on. Interfaces and abstraction exist for a reason.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t quite see how it returns the result you reported with those inputs, but walk through the equals() function in your mind for the first iteration of the loop (when i is 0 and y is 0), what happens?</p>

<p>I know it&#39;s frustrating when you&#39;re learning so much more outside of school rather than inside, but the point of the degree is to look at the tiny details that you wouldn&#39;t have concerned yourself with otherwise.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Awesome! Thank you!
After looking through Stylish&#39;s library though, I can&#39;t seem to find a mod that does what I need. :(
Also, I need to be able to distribute the script so I can get a good sample group for my research. I don&#39;t think It would be simple enough to have users download the web app, then download a mod within it, I may be wrong though. 
Any ideas?</p>

<p>My lack of experience kept me from STARTING any learning projects which lead to me being the least useful person in the office.  If I had one piece of advice for OP I would say &quot;trust your instinct.&quot;  If you think you are under-performing then now is likely your only chance to fix it.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry if this comes across mean, but if you are implementing a binary search tree you should be aware that declaring variables with 1 letter is bad practice and makes the code harder to read.</p>

<p>Now for the insert function. lines 59 and 70 contradict each other.  </p>

<p>a simpler way to do this would be: </p>

<p>check if the root is null. if the root is null then that string becomes the root and you return. Then your while works and your are left exactly where you want to set the node&#39;s values. So you do not have to go up a level for no reason. </p>

<p>This is obviously safer than having Java installed on your system, which any application could access.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Python is perfect for web dev.

</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply! Gives a great overview of how it all works. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be referencing the source code taken from the WebAudio API website, the microphone example. Source code for their microphone input is here -&gt; <a href="http://webaudioapi.com/samples/microphone/microphone-sample.js">http://webaudioapi.com/samples/microphone/microphone-sample.js</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Cool, thanks for clearing that up!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Alright, I decided I&#39;m going to write a guide for me while learning, so if anyone has any input or corrections on anything I say please chime it it&#39;s more than welcome.</p>

<p>So basically WebAudio API is a great way to upload audio files to your app, without using external plugins etc. It can also, utilize a users Webcam and take pictures. You can read up more about the backstory and capabilities on e-book in OP as well as this link <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/</a>.</p>

<p>Some key notes, html5 WebAudio API is already integrated and you will not have to include any links or external libraries. You will be utilizing the $navigator. getUserMedia (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia</a>) which will ask the user for access to the specified device and run callback functions based on their response / if a device is found.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I learned/managed to find in the past hour, will keep updating.</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;ll also be posting progress on my project and possibly code for anyone who&#39;s interested</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use a userscript. Firefox has Greasemonkey and Chrome has Tampermonkey. They let you run arbitrary JS on pages.</p>

<p>For something like hiding stuff, you&#39;ll want to use Stylish instead, which is like a userscript but for CSS (which defines how web pages look).</p>

<p>For example, here&#39;s a user script that I use to add syntax highlighting to code on Reddit. Makes the code posted in this sub more readable:</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s never going to be a &#39;be more awesome&#39; tutorial you can just pickup and read; once you&#39;re out of college it just doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>You have to actually build things; pick something you care about, build a thing with it (this pokemon thing is a great example; <a href="http://jimmyhillis.com/pain-point-pkmn/">http://jimmyhillis.com/pain-point-pkmn/</a>)</p>

<p>It might turn out to be rubbish and a complete failure, but the process of building things that its <em>ok to fail at</em> is a really important thing, and you&#39;ll never get the opportunity to do at work.</p>

<p>You most certainly <em>do not</em> need to go home everyday and hack away until midnight. That&#39;s totally unhealthy. ...but you know, devote one evening a week to building something instead of playing games, and you&#39;ll very quickly learn a lot of things.</p>

<p>The real problem is that if you &#39;only work at work&#39; you will eventually pick up similar skills... but it&#39;ll take much much longer. If you&#39;re working with an amazing team, this approach probably won&#39;t cut it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>echo(substr(http_get(&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilu%22),6131,10)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilu&quot;),6131,10)</a>);</p>

<p>Well, I tried.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Or;
How would I do this as a Google Chrome web extension?
Same concept right?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Learn HTML first. It&#39;s very easy. It&#39;s a markup language (a way of structuring content), not a programming language. It describes how a webpage is structured.</p>

<p>Once you have the basics of HTML (you only really need the basics -- the advanced stuff are best learned &quot;when you need them&quot;), CSS is next. It&#39;s also a markup language. It describes the styling of a page and lets you do things like set fonts, sizes, and colors. As you can imagine, that&#39;s a huge part of web development and you&#39;ll be moving from HTML to HTML + CSS quickly.</p>

<p>Next is JavaScript. It provides interactivity. Eg, if you want a button on a webpage to do something (besides plain links), you&#39;ll need JavaScript. For example, voting on a reddit comment uses JavaScript, as does submitting a comment or subscribing to a subreddit.</p>

<p>The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) has guides for all of these.</p>

<p>JavaScript runs client side. That&#39;s only half the story. When you click the upvote button on my post, you don&#39;t just execute some JavaScript. The JavaScript sends a request to reddit&#39;s servers (this uses a technology called &quot;AJAX&quot;). Once it reaches the server, pretty much any language can be a &quot;server-side language&quot;. Any of the languages you already know will work here (just google for &quot;&lt;language&gt; web framework&quot;). This is far off. HTML + CSS + JS is a good start for now, but you will want to move to a server side language eventually.</p>

<p>Most sites generate the HTML on the fly from a server side language. For example, Reddit has posts stored in a database (SQL is the language you&#39;d typically learn to interact with a database) and the server side language (Python in Reddit&#39;s case) creates the HTML page that you see.</p>

<p>Where to learn a server side language depends on the language and framework that you use. For the most part, you&#39;d learn the language the same way as any other and then learn the framework from official documentation on their website (although there might be other sources, I&#39;ve found that the official documentation is usually the best bet for keeping up to date).</p>

<p>Which server side framework isn&#39;t really that important, especially for a beginner. Feel free to experiment (there&#39;s a lot of Python frameworks). You should start with a static site (HTML + CSS + JS), anyway.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>16 weeks is one of the longer ones, actually. Even at 12 weeks, which was how much instruction time there was, there are still some shorter than that. I don&#39;t know how they fit it all in, though! The last 4 weeks of mine, by the way, was an internship. That said, we had the job fair before those were even over, and I can&#39;t say my internship helped me too much. It was really about what I learned and the bootcamp leader&#39;s networking abilities. I met my current employer at the job fair we had around week 14.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Are you incompetent? That&#39;s a harsh word, and not one I&#39;d use... But yes. You know nothing. The good news, however, is that you&#39;re aware of the fact, and you&#39;re surrounded by bright people who will inspire you to learn. Count yourself lucky... in my first year I didn&#39;t even know most of those words you mentioned. </p>

<p>It&#39;s exposure that will make you know what to learn, and it sounds like you&#39;re in exactly the right environment for that. Just listen to them talk, google the words you don&#39;t know, and soak it all in. Before you know it, you&#39;ll be far ahead of most people in the front-end world. </p>

<p>Seriously. You are very lucky to be where you are. <em>LEARN!</em></p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Angular is one of the newish javascript frameworks that&#39;s made to build single-page applications. It gives you things like templating, two-way data binding, and more.</p>

<p>Iconic is another framework, built on top on Angular, that&#39;s geared specifically for hybrid mobile app use.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: to clarify framework vs library -- a library is a utility tool that you pull in and use it where you need it, whereas a framework is more comprehensive and tends to influence how your entire codebase is written (scaffolding).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I recommend:</p>

<pre><code>public Flight(Airplane airplane, String departureCode) {
    this.airplane = airplane;
    this.departureCode = departureCode;

</div><div class="md"><p>I am not the OP, but as I mentioned to someone else, I got hired as a developer after a 16-week bootcamp (no other experience).

</div><div class="md"><p>I had no idea that it was that quick. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>also, find yourself a mentor that will help guide you. I worked in tech (not development) so I met a lot of programmers that I could come to for questions and help. my ex-boyfriend was also a programmer and he would help me from time to time.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I am not the OP, but I was hired after a 16-week bootcamp. Best investment I ever made.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I learned how to code on my own for a year then attended a programming bootcamp -- landed a dev internship after and interviewed for my current company (the whole process took a month) through the bootcamp&#39;s connections. it wasn&#39;t an easy feat, I gave up a year of my life, made no money for a long time and took a huge gamble. I&#39;m currently looking at online degrees for C.S. now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thinking you need to learn every part of a language academically before starting to actually make something. Once you know the basics, or if you already know the basics, just start making something and learn new things as you need them.</p>

<p>You may find that once you get something decent, you look at your code and it now looks like a mess because you know more now. That is great. You&#39;re learning. Write again with these knew things you learned in mind to make a better version of the code/program.</p>

<p>Basically, you&#39;re writing v1 with the intent to throw it away, just so you can learn what you need and how you should have gone it.</p>

<p>This idea translate many places. When I was in college I was told that as soon as you figure out college you&#39;re ready to leave. In the case of coding, as soon as you figure out how your program works, you can then re-write it, there is no expression date. This isn&#39;t just something for new programmers. I have seen many big name companies do ground up re-writes. Over time you learn things, and stuff changes. So from time to time, this makes sense.</p>

<p>Finding Forester also had an example of this idea.... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juko0sAndsA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juko0sAndsA</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the answer, guys. Will a company concerned with security hesitate to use Java-written application?</p>

<p>Also, out of curiosity, what makes Java bundled with an application safer than having Java on your computer? See: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/210907/minecraft-doesnt-need-java-installed-anymore-its-time-to-remove-it/">http://www.howtogeek.com/210907/minecraft-doesnt-need-java-installed-anymore-its-time-to-remove-it/</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Uh I like that. I often have to mess with a language or script, say for example bash. I use it oncem to complete a job task, then again 1 year later, and I completely forgot how to write shell scripts. </p>

<p>Having a guide repository would solve this isssue.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re approaching this from the wrong angle -- you should stop focusing on the individual language and instead look at the bigger picture. </p>

<p>If you want to be a truly excellent programmer, you should be able to pick up pretty much any language relatively easily. If you&#39;re the type of developer who&#39;s unwilling, afraid, or unable to learn new things, you&#39;re risk become obsolete since you&#39;re slower or unable to adapt to changes and shifts in the field.</p>

<p>Also, you mentioned in another comment that you&#39;re having difficulty learning things like polymorphism, linked lists, inheritance, etc. The thing is, none of those are Java-specific things -- those are all things common to any programming language that works within the object-oriented paradigm, or are things common to computer science in general.</p>

<p>As a result, it looks like what you&#39;re struggling with isn&#39;t actually Java, but is the more fundamental concepts underlying every mainstream programming language. This is a good thing -- it means that your CS curriculum is challenging you to learn more beyond the relatively minimal amount of theory and CS knowledge you need to know in order to build a Rails app.</p>

<p>After all, the purpose of a CS education is to teach you about computer science. Web development is just one incredibly tiny aspect of CS and programming, and it&#39;d be foolish and myopic to focus exclusively on that to the detriment of everything else.</p>

<p>If the only thing you know how to do when you graduate from your school is how to build websites, I&#39;d argue that you&#39;ve basically wasted bunch of money and several years of your life. So, rather then complaining about your CS class, make the best of it and extract every single piece of knowledge and utility that you possibly can.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Maybe stop &quot;learning languages&quot; and start building something with some languages? That&#39;s where you really learn. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In terms of general programming, everyone else in this thread is correct, but I want to add my $0.02.</p>

<p>Thus, abandoned libraries that handle UI or rely on old version specific behavior might not work properly or look out of place with newer releases, and sometimes it&#39;s just not worth figuring out how to update them for the newer UI/UX.</p>

<p>Use an old library if you want to, by all means, but if you can find a newer and more maintained alternative, it&#39;s usually worth using instead, as it would suck to implement an older library just to find it completely screws up your app with a new Android version.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There is never anything wrong with learning C. If you do well with C, you are learning a language with a lot of running legacy code, and that is important to a lot of employers. Not to mention, being good at C means you&#39;ll likely be good at any other language you want to learn.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Actually, if you think about it, you can come up with a model where it&#39;s bound to happen. Let&#39;s say that given any bug, you and your friend have a 90% chance of seeing it, and that such chances are independent. That means that your friend has a 90% chance of seeing that 1/10 bug that you don&#39;t see. Thus, you&#39;ll always feel like an idiot. :-)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem that he is facing (coincidentally what I am currently also facing) is that beginners like us don&#39;t know where to learn these kind of knowledge, the truth is for new grad like us if there is a textbook, or a tutorial we can learn the subject if we put in the effort, but if there are no beginner friendly resource it became very frustrating for us and we get lost really easily.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this is slightly off topic, but how did you get hired as a developer with 1 year of programming? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not so much broad, as you are actually asking three different questions. Anyway, I&#39;ve answered all three. If you pick one that you want to start with, I might be able to go into more depth.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, I guess I thought of Univ as more of learning the skills (as it&#39;s presented that way) with less of the meta-benefits such as character development or proving completion.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a set of skills I&#39;m comfortable with, but I definitely lack the GitHub portfolio to replace a degree.</p>

<p>I appreciate the insight :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve learned Fortran IV, 77, 90/95, Ada, and COBOL just for fun and an interesting (how old is this candidate) resume topic.</p>

<p>Honestly unless you cannot learn more than 1 language at a time, or you don&#39;t know the basics like C, java, python, JS etc, then I see no reason not to as a hobby.</p>

<p>Also learning C should be manditory. You learn so much from it, and everything post C has some influence from it it seems, also a ton of code is written in some C or derivative.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks, you are  absolutely right, my question is very broad, but part of the reason is that I don&#39;t know what should I learn after I know how to write backend in django , I am trying to prepare myself for jobs before I graduate, so I figure learning deployment will help me in the future. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Our checkin validation requires a link to the related task which is tracked in JIRA.  That is where most of this sort of information ends up.  We use TFS and I&#39;m not entirely sure that it allows pull requests....  I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a total noob with Git.  I&#39;m equally interested in hearing about how things work for you :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What kind of a job do you want after you graduate? I&#39;d say that&#39;s the most important factor.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d strongly recommend looking for libraries that are still updated. You can find a dead one, use it for a while then realize there&#39;s a pretty bad bug in it and nobody will solve it for you, as it&#39;s not maintained anymore.</p>

<p>If the library isn&#39;t that important on your project and there are no updated alternative, it&#39;s not the end of the world, but always favor maintained libraries.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry, I&#39;m a little unclear on what you&#39;re asking. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking how you can set things up so that people can download your program and run it on their computer, then you should use something like either <a href="http://www.filedropper.com/">FileDropper</a> which allows you to upload a file and share the download link (or link to the download on your own personal website, if you have one).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking if it&#39;s possible for people to directly run your program from their web browser, then generally speaking, that&#39;s going to be very difficult. Programs written in C++ generally need to be downloaded and are run directly -- the only languages that run directly in the web browser is JavaScript, and languages that run via a plugin, like Flash.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could try installing and setting up <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">Emscripten</a>, which is a project which will take your C++ code and convert it into JavaScript so you can run it directly in the web browser, but honestly, I think it&#39;d probably just be simpler to learn JavaScript and rewrite your program using JS.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The biggest wrong attitude I can think of off the top of my head is the mindset that &quot;good programmers&quot; create elegant perfection from scratch. The reality is that even the best programmers begin by writing something small, making it work, then adding to it and revising what they&#39;ve already done as they go. Nobody, not even the most brilliant software engineer, designs a perfect application on paper, and then codes it to a finished state in one go. So be prepared not to be perfect, because nobody is.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Avoiding subjects that you find difficult or that you find uninteresting. Your time is usually best spent learning things that you AREN&#39;T good at, provided that they&#39;ll be useful to you in the future. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C and Perl may be old, but they are here to stay. If it makes you happy, I think it&#39;s a good idea. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>To add to the previous response, if you compiled your program in Visual Studio you will also need people who use your program to install the appropriate redistributable package for your version of Visual Studio.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C is old but very much alive and kicking.  Learn it.  Java is newer, but I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s shinier.  Still Java and C# are both worth learning as much as C.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rubber duck debugging</strong> is an informal term used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">software engineering</a> for a method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a> code. The name is a reference to a story in the book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></em> in which a programmer would carry around a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck">rubber duck</a> and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.  Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.</p>

<p>Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a programming problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.  By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to involve another person.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It can help to break down the problem first. For example, write everything out in pseudocode before you start actually coding (although coding-on-the-fly is pretty fun, it gets sloppy fast). You can also try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging.</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>One of the biggest issues I have with my students is comparing themselves to others.  Everyone learns at different paces and others have often practiced more or less before coming into my program.  It&#39;s a relatively useless comparison especially when they tend to underestimate their own skills and overestimate others.  </p>

<p>Not asking for help at the right times.  You want to learn on your own, but spinning your wheels for hours on end when it isn&#39;t a matter of intelligence but just, for example, not knowing the right search term will make you hate programming in a hurry.  </p>

<p>Not focusing on learning one thing well at a time.  Too many beginners bounce around too much between languages and frameworks, never taking the time to truly understand what they are working on.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Agree with this, though I think he might want to discuss that with his manager or team-lead, just to be clear about expectations. Sometimes companies communicate very little to employees about expectations and it&#39;s hard to tell if you&#39;re doing well or not.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Always happens,  but i am a moron!  Best thing I&#39;ve found to do is just leave it and come back to it.  Go watch some TV if you are stuck,  come back a few hours later with a fresh look at it and you might find what you have been missing.  So many times i have been stuck on doing something,  i get frustrated and Crack it,  leave it for a few days and go back to it,  then just whack myself because it was so simple</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Advice from someone who hires. People don&#39;t hire quitters.  One of the advantages of going to uni is it proves you have what it takes to start something complex and see it through to the end.   The self-learner has to sell this without the benefit of a degree and will have a more difficult time.  By dropping out, you will make proving your motivation even more difficult.   </p>

<p>Take a look at your second paragraph and ask yourself if that is the kind of person you would want to hire.  The things you describe are exactly what happens when you start out in many jobs.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I agree. A lot of HR people simply don&#39;t realize that self taught programmers can be as good or better than CS/CE grads. A lot of other HR people don&#39;t give a shit what your degree is in, they just won&#39;t hire anyone without a degree for a salaried position. They&#39;d rather hire someone with 4 years experience and a degree in art history than someone with 8 years experience and no degree.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the case everywhere, obviously. But many large corporations have extremely rigid HR departments with somewhat antiquated thinking.</p>

<p>With only a year and change left, it would absolutely be better to stick it out.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think Android&#39;s official tutorial is a great start: 
<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html</a></p>

<p>After that, I&#39;d say start working on the app you want to make, if you aren&#39;t sure how to do something search for it. Stack overflow answer are especially helpful on how to do things the right way in android dev. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>my example was meant to be rhetorical.  learning anything as complex, nebulous, and open ended as <em>programming</em> will be a challenge for anyone.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the reddit formatting that made those into super scripts.  As <a href="/u/Sorten">/u/Sorten</a> said, string parsing is what you want (C++ strings are arrays of characters that you can iterate).</p>

<p>Also look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation#Computer_programming">Polish notation</a> if you need to handle strings with parenthesis, like 4(x+2x<sup>2</sup> ).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Libraries can stay untouched for two reasons, either they&#39;re pretty stable and feature-complete in the eyes of the author as it is, or they&#39;re abandoned. I generally tend to stay away from abandoned libraries, but if it&#39;s widely used, and a lot of people are relying on it, then if something breaks the library, there&#39;s likely to be a fork or a fix, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it that much. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Programming jobs rarely require degrees unless you&#39;re applying to a big company right out of school - but even the big companies don&#39;t require degrees if you have the experience. Jobs are easiest if you have a good reference - otherwise try and find a company that wants to help you grow and doesn&#39;t grill you with stupid CS questions or language implementation questions during the interview (though I would recommend being comfortable with typical design patterns).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not possible, you can&#39;t force a program to run. It it&#39;s indeed can, it would be a serious security issue and your system would have been full of viruses already.</p>

<p>What must do is to know the requirements of running the mu.exe program and never break them. i.e. folder location, data file location, setting files, etc. I&#39;m sure the game server already has its own specifications on how to deploy the game. So, RTFM.</p>

<p>Applying a simple event to HTML has been kicking my butt for the past two weeks. I&#39;m making progress but the simple fact is, there is a ton to learn and it doesn&#39;t matter how smart or talented or dedicated a person is, it still takes time, effort, humility, and lots of trial and errors.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>By the way, you should have gotten a compiler error on your original program.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Its not necessarily the degree you have but what you know and if the boss sees the potential in you.  I don&#39;t have a degree but applied to 80 or so places, got three responses, two interviews and one job.  A year and a half later and I&#39;m still junior, but I&#39;m learning and proving myself.  Make sure you ask questions, but as everyone at my company will tell you, google is your friend.  During my last review I was told I will be mid-level before next time, 6 months away now.</p>

<p>I was in a pretty much the same situation, and very glad I stuck it out and finished the degree.  One thing that helped me was having a paying internship the last two years of college.  If school is not challenging enough, work on your own projects.  Get an internship.  Do some freelancing (if you got some skills).  Write some apps or games for mobile.</p>

<p>If you want to build a file name programmatically, then you&#39;re going to need to build it in a <code>char</code> array first, and then pass a pointer to the first element of that array to <code>fopen</code>.

If you want to concatenate <code>&quot;.txt&quot;</code> onto the end of that string, use the <code>strcat</code> function from <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>, and then pass <code>text</code> as the first argument to <code>fopen</code>.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>From the user point of view, they can be similar. Internally, though, very different. Anyway, don&#39;t focus on PuTTY, it&#39;s a terminal emulator, and used for 10 billion other things besides developing Ionic apps. Learn Ionic and Angular.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A constructor is declared as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public ClassName(arguments) {
    // code
}
</code></pre>

<p>where ClassName is obviously the name of the class where you want to create the constructor. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Point {
    public Point() {
        // code goes here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usually, the constructor is used to initialize class variables:</p>

<pre><code>public class Point {

    protected int x, y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The constructor is called when the class is instantiated:</p>

<pre><code>Point point = new Point(1, 2);
</code></pre>

<p>Java allows overloaded methods, including constructors, so this syntax is allowed:</p>

<pre><code>public class Point {

    protected int x, y;

    public Point() {
        this(0, 0);
    }

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we have supplied a constructor with no arguments which will actually invoke the other constructor. So this code:</p>

<pre><code>Point point = new Point();
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>Point point = new Point(0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>For instance, in Java, you can use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#exec(java.lang.String)"><code>Runtime.exec</code></a>.  In general, most programming languages call this function something along the lines of <code>exec</code>.</p>

It&#39;s a fine line between making compact code and maintainable code.  You should get the practice now.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You can call a parent method using the <strong>super</strong> qualifier only if one class is a child of another. In you code, the classes Point and ArtilleryPiece are independent. They are not related to each other.</p>

<p>If you wanted to call the move method in the Point class from ArtilleryPiece, you would have to specify that ArtilleryPiece is a descendant of Point:</p>

<pre><code>class ArtilleryPiece extends Point {
    @Override
    public void move(double distance, double hAngle) {  
         super.move(distance, hAngle);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, unless the move method in ArtilleryPiece has different functionality from the parent, there is no need to override it. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class ArtilleryPiece extends Point {

}

ArtilleryPiece artillerPiece = new ArtilleryPiece();
artilleryPiece.move(1, 45);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we haven&#39;t overriden the move method in ArtilleryPiece - but it doesn&#39;t matter. So long as a public implementation exists in the parent class, it can still be referenced by a child class.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Your <code>ArtilleryPiece</code> class doesn&#39;t extend anything (so therefore it implicitly extends <code>Object</code>), and <code>Object</code> doesn&#39;t have a <code>move</code> method so <code>super.move</code> doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>In object-oriented programming, a class can extend another class (e.g. <code>public class Knight extends ChessPiece</code>), which allows the class to inherit all the public and protected data members and methods of the super class.  If a class doesn&#39;t explicitly extend another class, then the class implicitly extends from <code>Object</code> -- therefore, all classes ultimately have <code>Object</code> as their &quot;root&quot; superclass.  <code>Object</code> has a few common methods, such as the <code>toString</code> and <code>equals</code> methods.</p>

<p>Classes can also implement interfaces.  For instance, <code>ArrayList</code> implements Java&#39;s <code>List</code> interface.</p>

It won&#39;t be &quot;How do I compare a substring?&quot; (well, it could...), it will probably be &quot;Do you have a library to handle strings in this app?&quot;, &quot;Should I use bare javascript, or use JQuery to do this?&quot;, etc.</p>

If you have learned on your own, you should go back to school (not saying you need to take out a mortgage to get it) and learn the theory.  It may give you some more insight into things.  One other thing:  In the last 20 years more levels of abstraction have been added to the programming paradigm, you need to &quot;play&quot; a little deeper if you truly want to understand things.

</div><div class="md"><p>a small problem here</p>

<p>rnd.Next(1,10); only allows for values 1-9. This means its impossible to fill each dimension of your array with unique values coming from that rnd.Next. 
This will likely cause you to have an infinite loop when trying to assign only unique values per dimension. You need to expand the range of allowed values (e.g. rnd.Next(1,11); )</p>

<p>i&#39;m not sure what you were trying to accomplish with the checknum array. a simpler solution (while keeping the core of your code)</p>

<pre><code>            int[,] arr2d = new int[10,10];
        Random rnd = new Random();

        for (int x = 0; x &lt; arr2d.GetLength(0); x++)
        {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; arr2d.GetLength(1); y++)
            {
                var seeded = false;
                while (!seeded)
                {
                    int numb = rnd.Next(1, 11);
                    if(!Enumerable.Range(0, arr2d.GetLength(1)).Any(i =&gt; arr2d[x, i] == numb)){
                        arr2d[x, y] = numb;
                        seeded = true;
                    }
                }
            }
         }
</code></pre>

<p>there are better ways to do this, but that was a pretty small change to your existing code. It also allows you to increase the range of possible values. If you&#39;re not supposed to use linq, then just replace what the </p>

<pre><code>if(!Enumerable.Range(0, arr2d.GetLength(1)).Any(i =&gt; arr2d[x, i] == numb))
</code></pre>

<p>with a method call checking for uniqueness. I don&#39;t suggest just nesting another loop as you&#39;ve already gone beyond the &quot;good coding standard&quot; for nested blocks of code.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, MPI is between processes, and often also between machines. SSE is a single core, but issuing instructions that can operate on an array at once. You can think of it as a 8 robots controlled by a single controller that must operate in lockstep. At a very broad level, you can think of OpenMP as multiple-threaded computation, though it is capable of taking advantage of SSE.</p>

<p>Which you use depends on the code. You can have a code that uses all three, actually. SSE has only a single instruction stream, so you can&#39;t be executing different instructions using SSE/AVX. OpenMP cannot span machines, so you can only go up to the number of cores on a machine. On the downside, MPI has relatively high communication cost, so if you need a lot of communication, then you may not get much speedup.</p>

The mismatch is resulting in undefined behavior - anything can happen. It happens to be printing nonsense instead of crashing.</p>

<p>You can fix this by using <code>cout</code>.</p>

<p>new code -&gt; <a href="http://ideone.com/sl7odx">http://ideone.com/sl7odx</a></p>

<p>my sintax from Comprasteste.txt are:
first code: code of produto and needs to be in FichaProdutos
second code: preço needs to be more then 0.0
third code: quantidade needs to be more then 0
four code : needs to be N or P
fifth code : code of client and needs to be in FichaClientes
six code: mes need to be &gt;0 and &lt;=12</p>

<p>But in this example I just considerer the code of produto, code of cliente, mes and quantidade</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, so, the immediate problem is that you are confusing std::string with C &quot;strings&quot;.</p>

<p>But the more important question is, what compiler are you using? g++/clang++ would have told you that you have a problem.</p>

<p>There is also the issue that if you use C++ iostreams, it&#39;s type-safe, but I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth harping on at this point in your learning.</p>

<p>There are a number of other issues also, but let&#39;s start with this.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, I must be missing something, but from the description of the problem, why use the bool array? Most straightforward to me is to generate each row by first generating a candidate number, and then checking for equality against all previous numbers.

<p>The problem description sounds like you don&#39;t need to check dupes between rows.</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>unfortunately setting the value of score to a high number does not guarantee success in the case that the user tests the limits of the program and acutally takes 1000000+ tries to guess the number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could initialize the best score to the maximum possible value. For example, if you&#39;re storing the score as an <code>int</code>, you could initialize it to <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>. </p>

<p>If the user tests the limits by guessing more than <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> times, you&#39;ll have other problems anyway (integer overflow). </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Icomoon is great too.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because your variables aren&#39;t initialized.</p>

<p>Local variables (e.g. variables inside methods, etc..) are not auto initialized, local members are.</p>

<p>Had you declared your int variables outside of your method as Members/fields/properties you would not be getting the error you are.</p>

<p>that said, as the_omega99 stated your if statements are bad anyways. Essentially, the &quot;else if&quot; is causing only one of those if statements to ever be processed. </p>

<p>I think you were looking for something like:</p>

<pre><code>         string initialEntry;
        int entryTest0 = 0, entryTest1 = 0, entryTest2 = 0, entryTest3 = 0, entryTest4 = 0;

        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter your value: &quot;);
        initialEntry = Console.ReadLine();

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[0]))
        {
            entryTest0 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[0]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[1]))
        {
            entryTest1 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[1]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0 + entryTest1);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[2]))
        {
            entryTest2 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[2]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0 + entryTest1 + entryTest2);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 3 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[3]))
        {
            entryTest3 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[3]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0 + entryTest1 + entryTest2 + entryTest3);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 4 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[4]))
        {

            entryTest4 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[4]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0 + entryTest1 + entryTest2 + entryTest3 + entryTest4);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>but there are easier ways to get the sum of the entered values. such as:</p>

<pre><code>        string initialEntry;
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter your value: &quot;);
        initialEntry = Console.ReadLine();
        var total = initialEntry.Where(v =&gt; Char.IsNumber(v)).Select(v =&gt; (int)Char.GetNumericValue(v)).Sum();
        Console.WriteLine(total);
        Console.Read();

</div><div class="md"><p>Enums are classes, they&#39;re just a special type of class that&#39;s perfect for things like your Suit and Rank, where there are a small number of instances and <em>that&#39;s it</em>.  You wouldn&#39;t want Suit to be a class and have people calling the constructor to make their own.  Other examples might be difficulty level in a video game (with values EASY, NORMAL, HARD), piece types in chess (PAWN, ROOK, etc.), or really anything that you pick from in a UI using radio buttons.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good example of a use for interfaces: my main personal project has this thing called a Trigger, and there are 3 distinct but separate places around the application that have a List&lt;Trigger&gt;, all of which need to be editable via the same editor dialog.  To make this editor multipurpose, it really just needs to be able to get and set the list of triggers from wherever.  So I made an interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface HasTriggers {
  public List&lt;Trigger&gt; getTriggers();
  public void setTriggers(List&lt;Triggers&gt; newTriggers);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dialog takes a HasTriggers in its constructor, uses getTriggers() to populate the UI for editing, and if OK is pressed, stores the list back with setTriggers(...).  The 3 places that need this editor just need to implement HasTriggers and the editor works with all of them.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I looked over your code more thoroughly because you mentioned &quot;formatting critique.&quot;  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the meaning of <code>tester</code>? The name is not very descriptive. Additionally, your while loop is <code>while(tester == false)</code> which could be replaced by <code>while(!tester)</code>... this always evaluates true if tester is false. This could be a bit confusing to read, though. I would recommend something like <code>while(gameRunning)</code>, or any other suitable name.</p></li>
<li><p>The following code appears in your program four times. If you move the first instance of it to inside the top of the while loop, the user will be asked to guess every time without you needing to write it every time. You may need to restructure the branches a little bit.</p>

<pre><code>   System.out.print (&quot;guess a number between 1 and 100: &quot;);
       guess = input.nextInt();
</code></pre></li>

</div><div class="md"><p>that worked perfectly! I&#39;m not sure why that never crossed my mind.</p>

<p>thanks a lot!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your very first term is <code>-x^5</code>. You first replace all <code>-</code> with <code>+-</code>, which gives you <code>+-x^5</code>. Then you split on <code>+</code>, which gives you <code>[,-x^5]</code>. You pass the the empty string in the first element to be parsed as a monomial, splitting on <code>x^</code>, which just gives an empty string in the first element again, which you then try to parse as a number. You&#39;ll run into a similar issue with the second term where you&#39;ll split that into <code>[-, 5]</code> but <code>-</code> by itself is not a number.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>FFS! Ask away! I recall, years ago, I was getting tired with one particular engineer who wouldn&#39;t stop talking about Google BigTable, distributed file systems like it was Gospel. A new era in storing and fetching data, and all that. Everyone was nodding along.</p>

<p>Me, being the impudent youngster, got fed up. &quot;What&#39;s a distributed file system?&quot; I blurted out. </p>

<p>They didn&#39;t even blink at it. Turned around and answered me right then and there. Spent the next hour being briefed on the technicals and snags in implementing such a thing. I learned quite a bit too.</p>

<p>Afterwards, I googled 10 to 20 new terms I learned that day.</p>

<p>Yeah, if I were you, I&#39;d roll my chair up to the nearest guy in the know, and ask straight up: &quot;What does a makefile do?&quot;</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The textbook answer will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your database table should have at least 4 columns: <code>userId</code>, <code>userName</code>, <code>salt</code>, <code>saltedHashedPassword</code>.</li>
<li>Having <code>userId</code> and <code>userName</code> be distinct allows the user to change their <code>userName</code> without issues.</li>
<li><code>userId</code> should be an identity column.</li>
<li>The primary key should be on <code>userId</code>.</li>
<li>A unique constraint should be on <code>userName</code>, so that <code>userName</code> is also distinct.</li>
<li>Then, the login form eventually submits the <code>userName</code>, <code>password</code> to the server.<br/></li>
<li>When creating a new user, you should create a new unique salt (the salt should be distinct for every user), and then compute the <code>saltedHashedPassword = HASH(password + salt)</code>, where <code>HASH</code> is a pre-written industry-standard password hashing function.  Then, you INSERT a new row into the table and return the new row&#39;s <code>userId</code>.  (In SQL Server, the query might look like <code>INSERT INTO users (userName, salt, saltedHashedPassword) SELECT @userName, @salt, @saltedHashedPassword  SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY()</code>)</li>
<li>When an existing user tries to log in, you use their <code>userName</code> to look up the <code>salt</code> and <code>userId</code> (via a SELECT query <code>SELECT userId, salt FROM users WHERE userName = @userName</code>), and then compute the <code>saltedHashedPassword</code>.  Then, use another query to see if the <code>userId</code>&#39;s <code>saltedHashedPassword</code> matches what you computed.  (e.g. <code>SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE userId = @userId AND saltedHashedPassword = @saltedHashedPassword</code> and see if one row is returned vs zero rows)</li>
<li>When writing SQL queries, best practice is for all queries to be parameterized queries.  It looks like your code already is using parameterized queries, so that&#39;s nice.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, you want to always store the very first result no matter what the user scored. There are a few options that jump out to me: use a limit to represent INF, use a &quot;special value&quot; like -1 and write <code>if (temp &lt; score || score == (special value))</code>, or just always set score = temp if we&#39;ve just finished the first loop.</p>

<p>Second, range(a, b + 1) will give you all integers between a and b+1, <em>including</em> a, but <em>excluding</em> b+1, which means i will be 18 in the last iteration. (since while b &lt; 19, b becomes 18 and so does i)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Rather than creating a bunch of specialized classes, perhaps consider using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy Pattern</a>. Create various &quot;strategy&quot; interfaces (e.g. NetworkingStrategy, SpecialEffectStrategy), and then have class A utilize those strategies. For example:</p>

<pre><code>// Instead of a specialized AWithSpecialEffect class:
A obj1 = new A(
    new BasicSpecialEffectStrategy(), 
    new NoNetworkingStrategy());

// Instead of a specialized AWithSpecialEffectAndNetworkSupport class:
A obj2 = new A(
    new BasicSpecialEffectStrategy(), 
    new BasicNetworkingStrategy());
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in the A class, wherever you might have special effects, for example, you can do something like: </p>

<pre><code>specialEffectStrategy.doSpecialEffects(); 
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the Builder pattern to use reasonable defaults, then you only need to change whatever is special, rather than specifying all the strategies in the constructor: </p>

builder.useBasicSpecialEffects();
A obj1 = builder.build();

But I think this article here covers a lot of practical difference to be aware of when learning/programming between the two:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/java/Java008.htm">http://www.dickbaldwin.com/java/Java008.htm</a></p>

<p>If you flip through any C++ book or tutorial,you read about decision control statements, how to write classes, OOP stuff, etc. It&#39;ll look very familiar and you&#39;ll quickly see the syntax required to write it correctly. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll eventually run into things you don&#39;t think you seen before like pointers or using new/delete to allocate memory, but really you experienced iit n Java that before too. Pointer works like reference in Java but just allows you to have a finer control over it (like doing pointer arithmetic). New/delete is done in Java too, just not by you but by the JVM garbage collector.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ohh thanks for explaining interfaces, I never understood what their point was in high school, now that I&#39;m taking C++ I can at least understand why someone would want to use them. As enum files though, when would it be a good time to use them, or are they kind of something that isn&#39;t used much because it can be replaced with a class?</p>

<p>If the input string is non empty and the first character is a number, you&#39;ll go into the first branch. You&#39;ll never go into the others unless the character at the index being checked isn&#39;t a number. So if the input is &quot;1234&quot;, you&#39;ll go into the first if branch. And that&#39;s it, because if-else statements go into the first branch that they can.</p>

<p>I think you want your else-ifs in the reverse order. ie, check for the longest string first, if that fails, try the next size. Although your code doesn&#39;t really do anything useful, so there may be a better approach depending on what exactly you&#39;re trying to (gotta mention that -- it&#39;s important).</p>

<p>PHP is often tested but how much depends on the developer/company.  Many packages come with a set of unit tests you can build from.  symfony2 does a good job at writing unit tests that are worth learning from.  </p>

<p>A good way to learn to write tests is write a bunch of tests every time you fix a bug.  Eventually you&#39;ll learn what tests you should have written up front to catch those bugs.</p>

<p>My final suggestion is to out everything in a while loop and ask them if they want to exit or try again. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Well, for one thing, the bare bone basics of the OS are not very different from Windows, so a pure beginner can pickup Linux and more or less use it as well as they could use Windows. I&#39;m referring to the generate navigation of the OS and running programs within it. Most beginners probably aren&#39;t familiar with how Windows does things like syscalls or the terminal, anyway.</p>

<p>So, why Linux?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Better terminal and shells. Beginner programmers for most languages will be writing console programs, so a strong terminal and shell is very useful here. And IMO, a beginner programmer should learn the basics of a terminal and shell before they learn to program.</p></li>
<li><p>Comes with everything many programmers need. With Windows, you gotta install the compiler and such first. For Linux, some of the most popular languages are basically &quot;ready to go&quot;. For example, GCC and G++ are preinstalled in every Linux distro I&#39;ve seen, making it easier to jump into developing with those languages. You can focus on learning to program and not on installing dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of dependencies, the package manager that many Linux distros have (particularly apt-get) makes it easy to get tools for other languages. Want to learn Python? <code>apt get install python3</code> and you&#39;re ready to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Some would argue that Linux makes interacting with the OS easier. I&#39;m not so sure about this. The Windows API is quite extensive and often higher level than the POSIX standard that Linux follows. Although being POSIX compatible means that you can use the same code for many OSes. Heck, certain versions of Windows are even POSIX compliant (I have no idea why Microsoft has decided to hide this in the &quot;regular people version&quot; of Windows).</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s be honest: a large reason for people to advocate Linux is because they support the free and open source software movement, of which Linux is a marvelous flagship of. It&#39;s a piece of FOSS that is so crucial that companies even pay people to develop for it and it&#39;s used for personal and commercial use worldwide. Many programmers identify strongly with this ideology, so advocate Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux is made by programmers with other programmers in mind. This is really distro dependent. Some are more dumbed down than others. But most of them afford the user more customization and choice than Windows or OS X. For example, Windows thinks that you shouldn&#39;t be able to change file extensions without a warning. There&#39;s no way to disable this warning. This is obviously a feature for less technical users who don&#39;t understand file extensions and accidentally changing the extension would likely result in them being unable to open the file. Most halfway technical people don&#39;t have this problem, and this isn&#39;t a &quot;feature&quot; I&#39;ve seen in any Linux distro.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s other advantages of Linux, but I would think that these are the biggest ones for why someone would advocate Linux to beginners. I think #5 is probably the strongest point for most people. After all, Windows has PowerShell to combat point #1. Point #2 is quite minor (you only set things up once and there&#39;s no guarantee that you&#39;re in developing in one of these languages). Point #3 is remedied by some third party Windows package managers. #4 doesn&#39;t apply to the POSIX compatible versions of Windows (off the top of my head, I know Win 7 Ultimate is). And #6 is more for experienced programmers than beginners.</p>

<p>EDIT: One other advantage of using Linux is the case sensitivity of the file system. This is just plain good practice, since programming languages are usually case sensitive. Not to mention that having a case sensitive file system means that you&#39;ll be less likely to accidentally make your programs incompatible with Linux.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s seems like a good idea, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if my professor took off quite a few points for it. He&#39;s really particular and wants us to check it against all the other numbers in the array</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your comments are as unclear as your code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your names are perfect.  For something that small one package is fine, and multiple source folders are only needed for majorly separate things (a big application may have a src folder and a test folder, for example).</p>

<p>It probably makes sense to have your Suit and Rank enums inside the Card class, and have them be public and static.  That way outside code can see them, but they&#39;re clearly part of Card.</p>

<p>When you ask about interfaces, I assume you mean that abominable pattern where people make a goddamn &quot;I[whatever]&quot; interface with a corresponding &quot;[whatever]Impl&quot; class.  That&#39;s stupid bullshit that I think comes from C++ programmers, who are used to having separate header and implementation files.  Interfaces are used to specify common functionality, nothing more.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I know its not instrumental music But i have for 15 years in the business I use 80&#39;s Rock songs</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are several ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>A possible way is to generate a second (boolean) array that covers exactly the range of your random numbers.</p>

<p>As soon as a random number is generated, check it against that array using the random number as index. If it is not set, set it, otherwise if it was set, create a new random number.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you can think of the obvious solution:</p>

<pre><code>for i = 0 to array.size
    generatedNumber = random()
    while generatedNumber in array[0 : i]
        generatedNumber = random()
    array[i] = generatedNumber
</code></pre>

<p>Since these are numbers, you could speed things up at the cost of extra memory by using a binary search tree to figure out if the number is already in use.</p>

<p>Of note is that the run time of this algorithm will increase with the size of the array, since you&#39;ll have more collisions. For small arrays, you can expect a low number of collisions, and close to O(n<sup>2</sup>) time with the above approach or O(n log n) time with a binary search.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with any PRNG algorithms that could ensure uniqueness of their numbers (and that doesn&#39;t sound very random), so this approach is probably as good as you&#39;ll get.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Of course. There&#39;s a number of libraries and pieces of software that are stable and haven&#39;t been modified for years because they aren&#39;t looking to expand.</p>

<p>With that said, if you <em>do</em> happen to find a bug, you&#39;re probably on your own. Then again, finding a bug will often not have a quick fix from the library developer, anyway. So it&#39;s not a really big deal, IMO.</p>

<p>You don&#39;t test the return values of your <code>fopen</code> calls, so if there is an error (like when the files don&#39;t exist) your program just crashes. You should always test the return value of <code>fopen</code> to see whether it succeeded, and do something appropriate if it failed.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I understand that but I don&#39;t have no idea how solve this...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In your <code>leituraCompras</code> function, you pass the values of <code>mes</code> and <code>unidades</code> to <code>testeValidade</code>. But those variables might not be initialized when you do that. It is possible that the variables <code>mes</code> and <code>unidades</code> are never assigned values before they are passed to <code>testeValidade</code>.</p>

<p>Attempting to use the value of an uninitialized variable is a serious mistake. It means that your program has undefined behavior, which means that you have absolutely no guarantees about the behavior of any part of your program.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry about that I never knew how to do it right I always assumed reddit automatically formatted the code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Cool -- distributing your work is very easy in C++. All you have to do is compile your code -- once you compile your C++ file, your compiler should generate an executable file (something ending in .exe, if you&#39;re on Windows).</p>

<p>Then, all you have to do is send that exe to whoever wants to use your program, and you&#39;re basically done. You might have to end up doing a bit more work if your program is more complex and has a lot of dependencies/uses a lot of libraries, and you&#39;ll need to compile your program separately for each major operating system (so if you compile your program on windows, it&#39;ll only really work on windows), but for the most part just compiling your file should suffice.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Rather then asking us, I think it would be much more efficient if you just emailed the advisers at that particular college and ask them what the differences between the two programs are.</p>

<p>The job titles &quot;programmer&quot; and &quot;programmer-analyst&quot; are incredibly vague, and have so much cross-over that it&#39;s impossible to accurately predict what the differences between those two courses are without more info to work with.</p>

<p>Hence, you should just straight-up ask your college/investigate what classes you&#39;re required to take for those two programs to figure out what the difference is.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>At my current job we do not have a formal process, so everyone treats code review differently, and it&#39;s awful.</p>

<p>Some treat it as an opportunity to catch issues and learn. They&#39;ll accept feedback and post their updates until everyone is satisfied. That&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Some treat it as an inconvenience they have to go through in order to get a rubber stamp on what they&#39;ve already decided. They do not readily accept feedback and only rationalize, not even justify, their original code. That&#39;s terrible.</p>

<p>Some people push their code to the repo before sending out the review, which usually leads to a string of useless commit messages as they address CR comments. Some people use patches to post reviews and updates before it ever hits the repo.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are politics and egos at play so it&#39;s a nightmare trying getting an actual process in place.</p>

<p>I preferred the system at my last job where everyone sent a review before code went to the repository, got at least two others to do the review, and had to post updates until everyone marked &quot;ship it&quot;. Commit messages had to have the names of the people who signed off, or at least the CR id. That worked incredibly well for us.</p>

<p>The best code reviews tend not to be memorable, which is nice. They have a small set of changes, they&#39;ve explained the purpose of their changes in a description, and the code is clear. Everybody in the review is responsive to questions and changes. They often take less than 15 minutes total.</p>

<p>The worst code reviews are memorable. Two come to mind.</p>

<p>The first was a really complicated set of changes that merged 3 features into one giant review, required knowledge of our legacy systems and their interactions, and required attending architecture reviews to understand what was being attempted. The code was messy and extremely buggy and spread out across 4 different modules. The dev who wrote it was the kind who only wanted to get a rubber stamp and would not accept feedback.</p>

<p>That review took 4 weeks and 40 cumulative developer hours to complete. In the end, none of the devs wanted to sign off on either the architecture or the review, but it still got checked in. Then after 3 weeks (!) of testing it went out and brought down our site.</p>

<p>The other review was smaller in scope, but also done by a dev who would not accept feedback. It had performance concerns, maintainability concerns, and introduced an obvious way for any of our users to exploit our site. The dev never posted an update, decided they were done hearing comments, closed the review, merged everything in, and cut a release with all those concerns still in place. It&#39;s an escalating battle to keep it from going out.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s tough to google something if you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called. The key word to remember here is &quot;append&quot;, which means to add to the end.</p>

<p>The important part to note in the example is the mode that the file is being opened in. In most languages, when you open a file, you pick a mode. Read, write... blah blah. Often &quot;write&quot; defaults to writing to the beginning of a file. There is usually a mode to append to the end. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As for installing ipython (on windows), I recommend just using one of the big ol&#39; installer packages like <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">anaconda&#39;s distribution</a>.

<p>As for the installation process, make sure you check the box that says something to the respect of, &quot;add Anaconda, ipython to your PATH variable?&quot; </p>

<p>Make sure this is checked. Once it&#39;s installed, you just go to your Start menu, and type out iPython, and the &quot;notebook&quot; opens up in a new tab on your default browser.</p>

<p>Functional testing is automated user activity. I use selenium a lot for this as you can test that simulate user activity and automate user testing.</p>

<p>Regression testing is writing tests that prove a bug then going out and fixing it.  It ensures the bug doesn&#39;t return later down the track.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what you modified your struct City, the problem was not with that.</p>

<p>The problems with the current version:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are trying to read a string into a single char (name).  There is not enough space for that, unless the string is zero characters (don&#39;t forget the extra null termination character).</p></li>
<li><p>When you do:</p>

<p>struct City x = { &amp;name, latitude, longitude};</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You now have x-&gt;name pointing to a memory location on the stack (a pointer to name).  When you return from that function that memory location is no longer valid, and could contain anything.  You were closer then struct City::name was a char[20]</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That is not true, most programs are subscription based, such as CryEngine. From the sounds of it you are still early in your developing career. I wouldn&#39;t worry about royalties right away. Also consider that most platforms where you could publish your game are also taking cuts from it. If it&#39;s a mobile game Google Play and App Store take a 40% cut if I recall correctly AND want money from you just to be able to publish. Steam takes also a pretty hug cut. Appreciate the work that went into those engines. If you want to use Unity (which also charges you once you make more than 100k a year) because you prefer the engine then go for unity. But choosing unity over UE4 because you think the 5% royalties are greedy is just retarded. Also you only get the 5% charged once you make over 3k in a quarter, and those 5% don&#39;t include the first 3k. So if you make 4k the you are being charged but only 50 dollars (five percent of one thousand dollars)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I would recommend learning c++ before you learn c#.  I used c++ all throughout college and then got a job programming in c#.  It was so easy to learn and was like a dream come true in terms of ease of use.  The reverse will absolutely not be the same.  c++ requires you to think about a lot more. </p>

<p>It seems like your trying to skip a few steps here.  Someone mentioned learning c# through intellisense(I kind of did too, but I also looked up a lot on MSDN). If you don&#39;t know what intellisense is you should just google it. Part of programming is finding solutions and answers on your own.  If you can&#39;t figure it out then ask for help.  </p>

<p>To answer your question. Yes there a plenty of free online sources documenting almost everything you&#39;ll need.  </p>

<p>Here is what I recommend if you want to learn c#
-read the documentation on MSDN. Just browse through the methods for the common variable types so you can think back to them later.<br/>
-go to <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer/">/r/dailyprogrammer/</a> They have daily programming challenges for all levels (easy, medium, and difficult).  This will give you three projects that you can practice on every day.  Then you can post your solutions and get feedback. </p>

<p>here is the book I used in college. it is 122 dollars cheaper than the latest edition. The book is probably five dollars so you can&#39;t go wrong.  At least this book wont start off by telling you to learn another language. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>If you bought a book to learn C++ then just pull through and learn C++. Once you know the language and its functions it will be fairly easy to learn new OO languages such as C# or Java. Also lets be fair: 5% royalties is really not that much considering how much game engines cost. Look at the professional versions of Unity of programs like 3ds Max.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Most of the time you never need globals in well written code.  For example for yours the only thing you would ever need to pass to anything is the total they have given you or the change owed.  You would use the constants in the local scope.  </p>

<p>The reason you avoid globals is because while it works in something small like this when you get to a decent sized program like what you would use in a real world case it actually gets very very confusing and hard to read if you have 1000 global variables.  Globals also have some other issues as well.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I guess this seems to be your problem. What specifically do you struggle with? It&#39;s always best to break down a solution into mini problems and tackle them individually.</p>

<p>I would recommend getting better at graphics, at least to a point where you are happy with how it looks even if it&#39;s just a prototype. Even if your project isn&#39;t fully functional, a well made prototype can really help you make a statement and demonstrate it&#39;s potential.</p>

<p>When it comes to games, keep it simple but beautiful. The most recent example of this philosophy (in my opinion) is Darkest Dungeon. The game is beautiful but the mechanics behind it are really easy to mimic and I believe the fellows over at Unity have even produced tutorials on how to build your own rogue-like game.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty hard these days to <em>not</em> do something that has already been done before but that is really a good thing. As a programmer, you don&#39;t want to be recreating the wheel. You could argue that any recent first person shooter game is just a Doom clone... it&#39;s up to you to use your imagination and build on existing (successful) ideas and make it better.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard as well. And try not to blame them too harshly. It&#39;s not easy/nice getting languages like C++ and a scripting language bound together. From what I&#39;ve heard from folks who&#39;ve used it, it&#39;s pretty good. </p>

<p>I can tell you from my experience researching Python binding, and doing actual binding for node.js that it can be quite hellish. Lots of global state (more than simply registering factories or whatever), or just crazy solutions to problems. </p>

<p>For my teams game project, we&#39;re using a language a guy in our schools R&amp;D department created. It&#39;s not perfect, but I like (most of) the syntax, and it&#39;s binding is pretty great. Although to be fair, the guy who wrote it taught me himself, so I probably shouldn&#39;t bitch too much about the v8 or Python issues. I&#39;m sure the v8 binding problems I&#39;ve run into would be much easier if I were both taught by the v8 guys and had a direct line to them for questions. </p>
