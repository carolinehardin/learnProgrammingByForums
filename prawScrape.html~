Bootstrap - a responsive CSS framework
Foundation - another responsive framework.
Jquery - a super popular JavaScript library.
AngularJS - a popular frontend framework</p>

<p>Then there are almost a endless number of tools to use.
Like CSS preprocessors(less, sass)
Or build tools(grunt, gulp)</p>

<p>There is also a cool utility called yeoman that has tons of prebiotic solutions for many common frameworks. A simple command can get you a starting project containing the tools and frameworks you want to use.</p>

<p>It&#39;s telling me &quot;Double cannot be deferenced&quot;</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying to compile a game server called &quot;Teeworlds&quot; and it has many variations. Here are some examples:</p>

<p>Vanilla: <a href="https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds">https://github.com/teeworlds/teeworlds</a></p>

<p>DDNet: <a href="https://github.com/def-/ddnet">https://github.com/def-/ddnet</a></p>

<p>TW+: <a href="https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/tw-plus">https://github.com/Teetime/teeworlds/tree/tw-plus</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve been following <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/linux/kernel/building.md">this guide</a> since the comments were telling me to Google this, but one part I&#39;m confused about is why I need an image file and a reboot. Would I need to partition my SD card on my Pi? The tutorials I looked up doesn&#39;t quite explain for a layman how toolchain does what it does.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Think about how to rearrange the formula so you aren&#39;t dividing 5 by 9 in one step.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes. I won&#39;t completely give it away, because I want you to think about it. But just go back to high school algebra. How can you rewrite the formula so you avoid 5/9. You can&#39;t eliminate division, but you can avoid a numerator that&#39;s smaller than the denominator.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re creating a string but not assigning it a value. I assume you want to convert the dots in the double to commas? You can do the following:</p>

<pre><code>String str=Double.toString(g).replace(&#39;.&#39;,&quot;,&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>This will convert the double to a string, and then replace all dots with commas.</p>

<p>Edit: My java is a bit rusty...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>How did you land a job after only programming a year?!?! I would kill for a Jr. position just to get the opportunity to code all day.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I personally think the fault lays in who is looking. HR wants to see certifications or degrees because they demonstrate at least some knowledge of the topic at hand. That way, they can say they did at least some due diligence before handing you off for the technical interview.</p>

<p>You can hand HR your github account, but they have no clue what to do with that.</p>

<p>This is why I really dislike reddits hatred towards certification. A tech company where programmers are searching for programmers won&#39;t care, an enterprise with their own international programming will want to see that stuff.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A problem I have personally, is being in the mindset that I have to do everything quickly. Whether it be a book, online course, or project.. I hate spending time NOT working on stuff. Pace yourself and come up with a schedule or time frame for things that works best for you.</p>

<p>I always start a project and obsess over it until I&#39;m finished. My biggest issue and I&#39;m still not sure how to deal with it. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It really depends on the way you compile the source. If it&#39;s got a configure script, you can generally pass in the target architecture as an argument. If it&#39;s just got a makefile (but no configure), you can pass in the compiler you want to use. If you post a link to the git page, we can probably help you out easier.</p>

<p>Either way, you need to install the ARM compiler that the Pi uses. </p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Our checkin validation requires a link to the related task which is tracked in JIRA.</p>

<p>Sure.  If you wanted, why couldn&#39;t you push a &quot;stub&quot; branch that references the ticket?  Or is the company rule that a commit which references a specific ticket automatically flags the ticket as closed/pending closure?</p>

<p>Not try to argue a point or anything.  Obviously however your team/company does it works for you all. :D</p>

<p>Ah.  Git and GitHub are two separate but related things.  Git is a distributed version control system originally written to be the VCS for the Linux kernel.  GitHub is a git repository hosting service that integrates fairly seamlessly with the command-line tool and common git workflows (including pull requests).</p>

<p><strong>Impostor syndrome</strong>  is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internalisation_(sociology)">internalize</a> their accomplishments. Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved. Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent">intelligent</a> and competent than they believe themselves to be.

</div><div class="md"><p>The maze will be a grid with a fixed height and width. Within bounds just means that you cannot go outside the maze. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can look into cross compiling for the appropriate ARM architecture.</p>

<p>That&#39;s the toolchain portion. For the program itself, it depends on the code, right? Obviously, if it invokes platform specific functionality, or the program or its dependencies exceed your device limits, you have an issue there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Eh. !(Software isn&#39;t what it&#39;s cut out to be. Salaries are horrible. No benefits. All the big tech companies are stuck in the past. I wear a tie to work everyday, casual days are non-existent. And coffee-and-lunch time is extremely protracted in this industry).</p>

<p>... Yup. You should totally bail.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sure, but there are older languages like NATURAL, COBOL et al that simply don&#39;t do things in modern ways which are useless on a resume (unless you want to specialize in mainframe stuff and make big bucks as a consultant).</p>

<p>There&#39;s a reason for knowing them now, but they are slowly being phased out and it would take a lot of work to get to the level of the other consultants that dominate the area.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I had that problem until I landed on Python. Even after I decided that python was the language I wanted to finally master; after the first week of reading dive into python, my interest dissipated. I eventually learned the basics and then started to skip between different things like Django, opencv, and many  others. I ended up working with ROS. Through this 9 month experience I realized that it wasn&#39;t the programming languages that I didn&#39;t like, it was the material. I would suggest that you look for an end game goal. In my case it was robotics, then find a language that will work. Take your time learning the basics of whatever you chose, break up lessons into 10-20 min stints. This will keep you from running out of steam half way through.  Eventually you will finish the prerequisites, then you will be able to start the thing you really like . After a couple of weeks or less, if you are still bored out of your mind programming is probably not your calling.</p>

<p>Best of Luck,</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s been maybe eight years but one of my proudest achievements as a programmer was when I coded, in Scheme, a source cross reference program for a Scheme. I coded it in Nano over a remote terminal and then ran the program on itself. It worked the first time.</p>

<p>Nothing ever works the first time.</p>

<p>Prior to writing the code in the terminal, I had written the entire thing on paper over about four days, as I remember. It wouldn&#39;t have worked the first time but I did all the verification in my head as I, slowly, wrote it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, JOINs feel a bit weird, sort of like XSLT transforms, they don&#39;t quite have the direct &quot;do this now and then this&quot; aspect of most programming...but they let SQL optimize the query for you and it is usually quite good at that, and they are the basis of any real SQL programming.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It really depends on the SQL optimizer, but in general a nested select statement like this will be unable to use optimizations like hash joins and indexed lookups. The database engine is most likely doing far more work than it needs to, because it has to store all the intermediate results either in memory or temporary database space. This is most likely overwhelming the database engine.</p>

<p>You should obviously use the JOIN clause instead. Something like:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT a.response_value, a.fk_intervention_id, a.fk_question_id
FROM responses a
INNER JOIN interventions b
ON a.fk_intervention_id = b.pk_intervention_id
INNER JOIN country_region c
ON b.fk_country_id = c.fk_country_id
WHERE b.fk_module_id = 4
AND c.fk_country = 25
AND b.year = 2013
AND a.fk_question_id in (119, 122, 100, 1363, 130, 119, 122, 125, 127, 126, 138, 140)
</code></pre>

<p>I have used a, b and c as aliases, but you can obviously use whatever aliases you want.</p>

<p>This structure is far more efficient, because the database engine can either hash the join columns or use index-only scans to match rows eliminating the need to store interim data. It may look complex, but the JOIN clause is actually quite logical. Also, if you ever find a need to use LEFT joins, the sub-select method will not work at all.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>wow you should be a guide counsellor, but probably should be nicer or same contact in nicer tone. your comment really helped me, it was like a wake up call so thank you:&gt; 
I have a silly question, please don&#39;t make fun of this on this but how much knowledge(Im currently in U2 SW eng) do I need to make a web application like reddit?or develop software like shopify? again I know this sounds silly, please don&#39;t be cynical.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Confidence. The smell of confidence should be coming out of you from your resume and during interviews. To have the confidence you need to build some applications on your own. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmm ok thanks! I&#39;ll need to go away and read up on JOIN as you say, so that I can better understand your advice. It&#39;s this topic I new was there in SQL but I&#39;ve been avoiding... time to bite the bullet.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What is the goal? To learn to program or to create a good looking resume? If you&#39;re looking at resume improvement then you should research what your local market is looking for. If you are trying to learn how to program then it doesn&#39;t matter what language you use since programming is about thought processes and problem solving. The language is just a tool.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh, I see. I was thinking region was smaller than a country. In that case your inner nested SELECTs might not be too bad, since the innermost one only returns one value (and writing JOINs against two instances of the same table is hard to read).  </p>

<p>Anyway rather than doing SELECT from x where y in (SELECT...) etc you want to write it as a join, like:
SELECT response_value, fk_intervention_id, fk_question_id FROM responses_submitted, interventions where responses_submitted.fk_intervention_id = interventions.pk_intervention_id and 
fk_module_id = 4 and fk_country_id in etc  </p>

<p>or maybe even join the three tables, so it&#39;s something like:  </p>

<p>SELECT response_value, fk_intervention_id, fk_question_id FROM responses_submitted, interventions, country_region where responses_submitted.fk_intervention_id = interventions.pk_intervention_id and 
interventions.fk_country_id = country_region.fk_country_id
and fk_module_id = 4 and fk_region id in (that inner select statement)  </p>

<p>It may complain about not knowing which table certain fields that appear only by name (like fk_module_id) are from, so you may need to make it interventions.fk_module_id; many versions of SQL also let you put shorter aliases to tables in the FROM statement and then use those when referring to fields, so you can say SELECT from tablefoo t where t.field = value (&quot;t&quot; is the alias in this case).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>wow this is a great idea. I&#39;ve got a little moleskin I keep notes in, but I actually haven&#39;t actually bothered to write out any full fledged guide, because I feel like i&#39;d be wasting my time if I spend too much time not working on my project...</p>

<p>I think I&#39;ll start doing this!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Turn that question around and start thinking in terms of what is the correct approach to programming (including learning). You will make mistakes. Learn from them and move on.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Random advice: I&#39;m in uni, and I learn about a lot of random things that professionals use by listening to podcasts.  There are quite a few whore assumed audience is other professionals, and a mix of context and google will explain what they are talking about and teach you new things.

</div><div class="md"><p>C has a massive installed base - you won&#39;t be losing anything by picking it up. In addition - the more languages you know, the quicker you will pick up others. Programming is more about concepts than language specifics. At some point, you will be able to intuitively know what you need to do in order to solve a problem. You can then always just Google &quot;how do I do x in Java?&quot; and take it from there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>this is very good advice in here,  I just broke from that I have to learn everything before actually doing something. I&#39;m right now wprking in a portfolio while learning JS+jQuery, and reinforcing CSS &amp; HTML</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Should note that while Apple&#39;s EULA lets you use the OS in virtual machines, it only allows that on Apple hardware. So there&#39;s the question of legality. I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s any legal way to buy the OS standalone, either.</p>

<p>At any rate, it&#39;s possible, but non-trivial. Google &quot;run os x in virtual machine on &lt;target system&gt;&quot;.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Who said that? I can&#39;t think of any reason to avoid it. I&#39;ve seen this used in a number of major projects, too. For example, Apache Commons Lang uses this pattern.</p>

<p>My guess? Java is only available to that one application. </p>

<p>This is obviously safer than having Java installed on your system, which any application could access.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Python is perfect for web dev. I recently bought <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-Python-Harry-Percival/dp/1449364829/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1425784028&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=test+driven+development+with+python">this book</a> and great to someone who is proficient at programming but can get you into the world of software engineering techniques ( which is one of the things I&#39;m trying to do ) . The primary purpose of the book is to teach test driven development, but in the process, you learn to make web applications using Django, Selenium, jQuery, and Mock libraries.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the reply! Gives a great overview of how it all works. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ll be referencing the source code taken from the WebAudio API website, the microphone example. Source code for their microphone input is here -&gt; <a href="http://webaudioapi.com/samples/microphone/microphone-sample.js">http://webaudioapi.com/samples/microphone/microphone-sample.js</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Cool, thanks for clearing that up!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Alright, I decided I&#39;m going to write a guide for me while learning, so if anyone has any input or corrections on anything I say please chime it it&#39;s more than welcome.</p>

<p>So basically WebAudio API is a great way to upload audio files to your app, without using external plugins etc. It can also, utilize a users Webcam and take pictures. You can read up more about the backstory and capabilities on e-book in OP as well as this link <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/getusermedia/intro/</a>.</p>

<p>Some key notes, html5 WebAudio API is already integrated and you will not have to include any links or external libraries. You will be utilizing the $navigator. getUserMedia (<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/getUserMedia</a>) which will ask the user for access to the specified device and run callback functions based on their response / if a device is found.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all I learned/managed to find in the past hour, will keep updating.</p>

<p>edit: I&#39;ll also be posting progress on my project and possibly code for anyone who&#39;s interested</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use a userscript. Firefox has Greasemonkey and Chrome has Tampermonkey. They let you run arbitrary JS on pages.</p>

<p>For something like hiding stuff, you&#39;ll want to use Stylish instead, which is like a userscript but for CSS (which defines how web pages look).</p>

<p>For example, here&#39;s a user script that I use to add syntax highlighting to code on Reddit. Makes the code posted in this sub more readable:</p>

<pre><code>// ==UserScript==
// @name        Reddit code formatting
// @namespace   mike-hoffert.me.reddit

</div><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s never going to be a &#39;be more awesome&#39; tutorial you can just pickup and read; once you&#39;re out of college it just doesn&#39;t work that way.</p>

<p>You have to actually build things; pick something you care about, build a thing with it (this pokemon thing is a great example; <a href="http://jimmyhillis.com/pain-point-pkmn/">http://jimmyhillis.com/pain-point-pkmn/</a>)</p>

<p>It might turn out to be rubbish and a complete failure, but the process of building things that its <em>ok to fail at</em> is a really important thing, and you&#39;ll never get the opportunity to do at work.</p>

<p>You most certainly <em>do not</em> need to go home everyday and hack away until midnight. That&#39;s totally unhealthy. ...but you know, devote one evening a week to building something instead of playing games, and you&#39;ll very quickly learn a lot of things.</p>

<p>The real problem is that if you &#39;only work at work&#39; you will eventually pick up similar skills... but it&#39;ll take much much longer. If you&#39;re working with an amazing team, this approach probably won&#39;t cut it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>echo(substr(http_get(&quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilu%22),6131,10)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilu&quot;),6131,10)</a>);</p>

<p>Well, I tried.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Or;
How would I do this as a Google Chrome web extension?
Same concept right?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Learn HTML first. It&#39;s very easy. It&#39;s a markup language (a way of structuring content), not a programming language. It describes how a webpage is structured.</p>

<p>Once you have the basics of HTML (you only really need the basics -- the advanced stuff are best learned &quot;when you need them&quot;), CSS is next. It&#39;s also a markup language. It describes the styling of a page and lets you do things like set fonts, sizes, and colors. As you can imagine, that&#39;s a huge part of web development and you&#39;ll be moving from HTML to HTML + CSS quickly.</p>

<p>Next is JavaScript. It provides interactivity. Eg, if you want a button on a webpage to do something (besides plain links), you&#39;ll need JavaScript. For example, voting on a reddit comment uses JavaScript, as does submitting a comment or subscribing to a subreddit.</p>

<p>The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) has guides for all of these.</p>

<p>JavaScript runs client side. That&#39;s only half the story. When you click the upvote button on my post, you don&#39;t just execute some JavaScript. The JavaScript sends a request to reddit&#39;s servers (this uses a technology called &quot;AJAX&quot;). Once it reaches the server, pretty much any language can be a &quot;server-side language&quot;. Any of the languages you already know will work here (just google for &quot;&lt;language&gt; web framework&quot;). This is far off. HTML + CSS + JS is a good start for now, but you will want to move to a server side language eventually.</p>

<p>Most sites generate the HTML on the fly from a server side language. For example, Reddit has posts stored in a database (SQL is the language you&#39;d typically learn to interact with a database) and the server side language (Python in Reddit&#39;s case) creates the HTML page that you see.</p>

<p>Where to learn a server side language depends on the language and framework that you use. For the most part, you&#39;d learn the language the same way as any other and then learn the framework from official documentation on their website (although there might be other sources, I&#39;ve found that the official documentation is usually the best bet for keeping up to date).</p>

<p>Which server side framework isn&#39;t really that important, especially for a beginner. Feel free to experiment (there&#39;s a lot of Python frameworks). You should start with a static site (HTML + CSS + JS), anyway.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>16 weeks is one of the longer ones, actually. Even at 12 weeks, which was how much instruction time there was, there are still some shorter than that. I don&#39;t know how they fit it all in, though! The last 4 weeks of mine, by the way, was an internship. That said, we had the job fair before those were even over, and I can&#39;t say my internship helped me too much. It was really about what I learned and the bootcamp leader&#39;s networking abilities. I met my current employer at the job fair we had around week 14.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Are you incompetent? That&#39;s a harsh word, and not one I&#39;d use... But yes. You know nothing. The good news, however, is that you&#39;re aware of the fact, and you&#39;re surrounded by bright people who will inspire you to learn. Count yourself lucky... in my first year I didn&#39;t even know most of those words you mentioned. </p>

<p>It&#39;s exposure that will make you know what to learn, and it sounds like you&#39;re in exactly the right environment for that. Just listen to them talk, google the words you don&#39;t know, and soak it all in. Before you know it, you&#39;ll be far ahead of most people in the front-end world. </p>

<p>Seriously. You are very lucky to be where you are. <em>LEARN!</em></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Interesting. I actually do like this but I heard someone (possibly Standford Professor Mehran Sahami) that it should be avoided so I&#39;ve been on the fence about it lately.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>you might want to give bcrypt a look for your encryption.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I just started my first programming job month ago as Junior Web dev. I don&#39;t feel bad for not being as good as them. I make only third of what they make and in 10 years I will be as good or even better than them.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Names look reasonable.  But I wouldn&#39;t try to come up with different names for parameters and member variables and use <code>this</code> instead:</p>

<pre><code>public Flight(Airplane airplane, String departure, String destination) {
    this-&gt;airplane = airplane;
    ...
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Angular is one of the newish javascript frameworks that&#39;s made to build single-page applications. It gives you things like templating, two-way data binding, and more.</p>

<p>Iconic is another framework, built on top on Angular, that&#39;s geared specifically for hybrid mobile app use.</p>

<hr/>

<p>edit: to clarify framework vs library -- a library is a utility tool that you pull in and use it where you need it, whereas a framework is more comprehensive and tends to influence how your entire codebase is written (scaffolding).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I recommend:</p>

<pre><code>public Flight(Airplane airplane, String departureCode) {
    this.airplane = airplane;
    this.departureCode = departureCode;
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I am not the OP, but as I mentioned to someone else, I got hired as a developer after a 16-week bootcamp (no other experience). The head of it was really good with networking, and we had a great collection of folks at our job fair. I was hired by one of the companies there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I had no idea that it was that quick. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>also, find yourself a mentor that will help guide you. I worked in tech (not development) so I met a lot of programmers that I could come to for questions and help. my ex-boyfriend was also a programmer and he would help me from time to time.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I am not the OP, but I was hired after a 16-week bootcamp. Best investment I ever made.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I learned how to code on my own for a year then attended a programming bootcamp -- landed a dev internship after and interviewed for my current company (the whole process took a month) through the bootcamp&#39;s connections. it wasn&#39;t an easy feat, I gave up a year of my life, made no money for a long time and took a huge gamble. I&#39;m currently looking at online degrees for C.S. now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thinking you need to learn every part of a language academically before starting to actually make something. Once you know the basics, or if you already know the basics, just start making something and learn new things as you need them.</p>

<p>You may find that once you get something decent, you look at your code and it now looks like a mess because you know more now. That is great. You&#39;re learning. Write again with these knew things you learned in mind to make a better version of the code/program.</p>

<p>Basically, you&#39;re writing v1 with the intent to throw it away, just so you can learn what you need and how you should have gone it.</p>

<p>This idea translate many places. When I was in college I was told that as soon as you figure out college you&#39;re ready to leave. In the case of coding, as soon as you figure out how your program works, you can then re-write it, there is no expression date. This isn&#39;t just something for new programmers. I have seen many big name companies do ground up re-writes. Over time you learn things, and stuff changes. So from time to time, this makes sense.</p>

<p>Finding Forester also had an example of this idea.... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juko0sAndsA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juko0sAndsA</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the answer, guys. Will a company concerned with security hesitate to use Java-written application?</p>

<p>Also, out of curiosity, what makes Java bundled with an application safer than having Java on your computer? See: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/210907/minecraft-doesnt-need-java-installed-anymore-its-time-to-remove-it/">http://www.howtogeek.com/210907/minecraft-doesnt-need-java-installed-anymore-its-time-to-remove-it/</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Uh I like that. I often have to mess with a language or script, say for example bash. I use it oncem to complete a job task, then again 1 year later, and I completely forgot how to write shell scripts. </p>

<p>Having a guide repository would solve this isssue.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re approaching this from the wrong angle -- you should stop focusing on the individual language and instead look at the bigger picture. </p>

<p>If you want to be a truly excellent programmer, you should be able to pick up pretty much any language relatively easily. If you&#39;re the type of developer who&#39;s unwilling, afraid, or unable to learn new things, you&#39;re risk become obsolete since you&#39;re slower or unable to adapt to changes and shifts in the field.</p>

<p>Also, you mentioned in another comment that you&#39;re having difficulty learning things like polymorphism, linked lists, inheritance, etc. The thing is, none of those are Java-specific things -- those are all things common to any programming language that works within the object-oriented paradigm, or are things common to computer science in general.</p>

<p>As a result, it looks like what you&#39;re struggling with isn&#39;t actually Java, but is the more fundamental concepts underlying every mainstream programming language. This is a good thing -- it means that your CS curriculum is challenging you to learn more beyond the relatively minimal amount of theory and CS knowledge you need to know in order to build a Rails app.</p>

<p>After all, the purpose of a CS education is to teach you about computer science. Web development is just one incredibly tiny aspect of CS and programming, and it&#39;d be foolish and myopic to focus exclusively on that to the detriment of everything else.</p>

<p>If the only thing you know how to do when you graduate from your school is how to build websites, I&#39;d argue that you&#39;ve basically wasted bunch of money and several years of your life. So, rather then complaining about your CS class, make the best of it and extract every single piece of knowledge and utility that you possibly can.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Maybe stop &quot;learning languages&quot; and start building something with some languages? That&#39;s where you really learn. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In terms of general programming, everyone else in this thread is correct, but I want to add my $0.02.</p>

<p>Android is different from general programming, as guidelines for UI and behavior change fairly rapidly as Google iterates versions and presents new best practices.</p>

<p>Thus, abandoned libraries that handle UI or rely on old version specific behavior might not work properly or look out of place with newer releases, and sometimes it&#39;s just not worth figuring out how to update them for the newer UI/UX.</p>

<p>Use an old library if you want to, by all means, but if you can find a newer and more maintained alternative, it&#39;s usually worth using instead, as it would suck to implement an older library just to find it completely screws up your app with a new Android version.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There is never anything wrong with learning C. If you do well with C, you are learning a language with a lot of running legacy code, and that is important to a lot of employers. Not to mention, being good at C means you&#39;ll likely be good at any other language you want to learn.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Actually, if you think about it, you can come up with a model where it&#39;s bound to happen. Let&#39;s say that given any bug, you and your friend have a 90% chance of seeing it, and that such chances are independent. That means that your friend has a 90% chance of seeing that 1/10 bug that you don&#39;t see. Thus, you&#39;ll always feel like an idiot. :-)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think part of the problem that he is facing (coincidentally what I am currently also facing) is that beginners like us don&#39;t know where to learn these kind of knowledge, the truth is for new grad like us if there is a textbook, or a tutorial we can learn the subject if we put in the effort, but if there are no beginner friendly resource it became very frustrating for us and we get lost really easily.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sorry if this is slightly off topic, but how did you get hired as a developer with 1 year of programming? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, it&#39;s not so much broad, as you are actually asking three different questions. Anyway, I&#39;ve answered all three. If you pick one that you want to start with, I might be able to go into more depth.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s a good point, I guess I thought of Univ as more of learning the skills (as it&#39;s presented that way) with less of the meta-benefits such as character development or proving completion.</p>

<p>Currently, I have a set of skills I&#39;m comfortable with, but I definitely lack the GitHub portfolio to replace a degree.</p>

<p>I appreciate the insight :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve learned Fortran IV, 77, 90/95, Ada, and COBOL just for fun and an interesting (how old is this candidate) resume topic.</p>

<p>Honestly unless you cannot learn more than 1 language at a time, or you don&#39;t know the basics like C, java, python, JS etc, then I see no reason not to as a hobby.</p>

<p>Also learning C should be manditory. You learn so much from it, and everything post C has some influence from it it seems, also a ton of code is written in some C or derivative.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks, you are  absolutely right, my question is very broad, but part of the reason is that I don&#39;t know what should I learn after I know how to write backend in django , I am trying to prepare myself for jobs before I graduate, so I figure learning deployment will help me in the future. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Our checkin validation requires a link to the related task which is tracked in JIRA.  That is where most of this sort of information ends up.  We use TFS and I&#39;m not entirely sure that it allows pull requests....  I&#39;ll admit I&#39;m a total noob with Git.  I&#39;m equally interested in hearing about how things work for you :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What kind of a job do you want after you graduate? I&#39;d say that&#39;s the most important factor.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d strongly recommend looking for libraries that are still updated. You can find a dead one, use it for a while then realize there&#39;s a pretty bad bug in it and nobody will solve it for you, as it&#39;s not maintained anymore.</p>

<p>If the library isn&#39;t that important on your project and there are no updated alternative, it&#39;s not the end of the world, but always favor maintained libraries.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry, I&#39;m a little unclear on what you&#39;re asking. </p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking how you can set things up so that people can download your program and run it on their computer, then you should use something like either <a href="http://www.filedropper.com/">FileDropper</a> which allows you to upload a file and share the download link (or link to the download on your own personal website, if you have one).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re asking if it&#39;s possible for people to directly run your program from their web browser, then generally speaking, that&#39;s going to be very difficult. Programs written in C++ generally need to be downloaded and are run directly -- the only languages that run directly in the web browser is JavaScript, and languages that run via a plugin, like Flash.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you could try installing and setting up <a href="http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/">Emscripten</a>, which is a project which will take your C++ code and convert it into JavaScript so you can run it directly in the web browser, but honestly, I think it&#39;d probably just be simpler to learn JavaScript and rewrite your program using JS.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The biggest wrong attitude I can think of off the top of my head is the mindset that &quot;good programmers&quot; create elegant perfection from scratch. The reality is that even the best programmers begin by writing something small, making it work, then adding to it and revising what they&#39;ve already done as they go. Nobody, not even the most brilliant software engineer, designs a perfect application on paper, and then codes it to a finished state in one go. So be prepared not to be perfect, because nobody is.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Avoiding subjects that you find difficult or that you find uninteresting. Your time is usually best spent learning things that you AREN&#39;T good at, provided that they&#39;ll be useful to you in the future. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C and Perl may be old, but they are here to stay. If it makes you happy, I think it&#39;s a good idea. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>To add to the previous response, if you compiled your program in Visual Studio you will also need people who use your program to install the appropriate redistributable package for your version of Visual Studio.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C is old but very much alive and kicking.  Learn it.  Java is newer, but I really don&#39;t think it&#39;s shinier.  Still Java and C# are both worth learning as much as C.</p>

<hr/>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Rubber duck debugging</strong> is an informal term used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering">software engineering</a> for a method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging">debugging</a> code. The name is a reference to a story in the book <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer">The Pragmatic Programmer</a></em> in which a programmer would carry around a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck">rubber duck</a> and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck.  Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.</p>

<p>Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a programming problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.  By using an inanimate object, the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to involve another person.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It can help to break down the problem first. For example, write everything out in pseudocode before you start actually coding (although coding-on-the-fly is pretty fun, it gets sloppy fast). You can also try <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">rubber duck debugging.</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>One of the biggest issues I have with my students is comparing themselves to others.  Everyone learns at different paces and others have often practiced more or less before coming into my program.  It&#39;s a relatively useless comparison especially when they tend to underestimate their own skills and overestimate others.  </p>

<p>Not asking for help at the right times.  You want to learn on your own, but spinning your wheels for hours on end when it isn&#39;t a matter of intelligence but just, for example, not knowing the right search term will make you hate programming in a hurry.  </p>

<p>Not focusing on learning one thing well at a time.  Too many beginners bounce around too much between languages and frameworks, never taking the time to truly understand what they are working on.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Agree with this, though I think he might want to discuss that with his manager or team-lead, just to be clear about expectations. Sometimes companies communicate very little to employees about expectations and it&#39;s hard to tell if you&#39;re doing well or not.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Always happens,  but i am a moron!  Best thing I&#39;ve found to do is just leave it and come back to it.  Go watch some TV if you are stuck,  come back a few hours later with a fresh look at it and you might find what you have been missing.  So many times i have been stuck on doing something,  i get frustrated and Crack it,  leave it for a few days and go back to it,  then just whack myself because it was so simple</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Advice from someone who hires. People don&#39;t hire quitters.  One of the advantages of going to uni is it proves you have what it takes to start something complex and see it through to the end.   The self-learner has to sell this without the benefit of a degree and will have a more difficult time.  By dropping out, you will make proving your motivation even more difficult.   </p>

<p>Take a look at your second paragraph and ask yourself if that is the kind of person you would want to hire.  The things you describe are exactly what happens when you start out in many jobs.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I agree. A lot of HR people simply don&#39;t realize that self taught programmers can be as good or better than CS/CE grads. A lot of other HR people don&#39;t give a shit what your degree is in, they just won&#39;t hire anyone without a degree for a salaried position. They&#39;d rather hire someone with 4 years experience and a degree in art history than someone with 8 years experience and no degree.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the case everywhere, obviously. But many large corporations have extremely rigid HR departments with somewhat antiquated thinking.</p>

<p>With only a year and change left, it would absolutely be better to stick it out.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think Android&#39;s official tutorial is a great start: 
<a href="https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html">https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html</a></p>

<p>After that, I&#39;d say start working on the app you want to make, if you aren&#39;t sure how to do something search for it. Stack overflow answer are especially helpful on how to do things the right way in android dev. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>my example was meant to be rhetorical.  learning anything as complex, nebulous, and open ended as <em>programming</em> will be a challenge for anyone.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s the reddit formatting that made those into super scripts.  As <a href="/u/Sorten">/u/Sorten</a> said, string parsing is what you want (C++ strings are arrays of characters that you can iterate).</p>

<p>Also look into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation#Computer_programming">Polish notation</a> if you need to handle strings with parenthesis, like 4(x+2x<sup>2</sup> ).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Libraries can stay untouched for two reasons, either they&#39;re pretty stable and feature-complete in the eyes of the author as it is, or they&#39;re abandoned. I generally tend to stay away from abandoned libraries, but if it&#39;s widely used, and a lot of people are relying on it, then if something breaks the library, there&#39;s likely to be a fork or a fix, so I wouldn&#39;t worry about it that much. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Programming jobs rarely require degrees unless you&#39;re applying to a big company right out of school - but even the big companies don&#39;t require degrees if you have the experience. Jobs are easiest if you have a good reference - otherwise try and find a company that wants to help you grow and doesn&#39;t grill you with stupid CS questions or language implementation questions during the interview (though I would recommend being comfortable with typical design patterns).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not possible, you can&#39;t force a program to run. It it&#39;s indeed can, it would be a serious security issue and your system would have been full of viruses already.</p>

<p>What must do is to know the requirements of running the mu.exe program and never break them. i.e. folder location, data file location, setting files, etc. I&#39;m sure the game server already has its own specifications on how to deploy the game. So, RTFM.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What are you struggling with, exactly? Programming languages? Theory? Math?</p>

<p>I can do SAS and SQL in my sleep.  Need a database designed and implemented, no problem.  Want to measure your BLUPs in a random effects model, sure thing.</p>

<p>Applying a simple event to HTML has been kicking my butt for the past two weeks. I&#39;m making progress but the simple fact is, there is a ton to learn and it doesn&#39;t matter how smart or talented or dedicated a person is, it still takes time, effort, humility, and lots of trial and errors.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>By the way, you should have gotten a compiler error on your original program.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Its not necessarily the degree you have but what you know and if the boss sees the potential in you.  I don&#39;t have a degree but applied to 80 or so places, got three responses, two interviews and one job.  A year and a half later and I&#39;m still junior, but I&#39;m learning and proving myself.  Make sure you ask questions, but as everyone at my company will tell you, google is your friend.  During my last review I was told I will be mid-level before next time, 6 months away now.</p>

Create an array for all possible results 3 -&gt; 18.</p>

<p>Do your triple loop like you got</p>

<pre><code>xArray[x + y + z] += 1

<p>then the array will contain frequencies for each possible result. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just out of curiosity (and I don&#39;t mean to sound offensive), but how did you get a job? I&#39;m not saying that like you don&#39;t know anything (I&#39;m sure you have lots of knowledge), but after only a year of experience, how did you get a job? Some people can&#39;t get jobs after a degree.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Having a degree will give you more options and opportunities going forward.</p>

<p>I was in a pretty much the same situation, and very glad I stuck it out and finished the degree.  One thing that helped me was having a paying internship the last two years of college.  If school is not challenging enough, work on your own projects.  Get an internship.  Do some freelancing (if you got some skills).  Write some apps or games for mobile.</p>

<p>As far as &quot;how would I apply this in a real world setting&quot; goes, think of it as an exercise that makes you stronger.  Your learn one thing at a time, but you only see how it all fits in the bigger picture much later.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>maybe you just aren&#39;t cut out to be a programmer</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In your IDE, passing tests show some sort of green icon and failing tests show a red icon. So in TDD you write tests and when you run them you should see them all be &quot;red&quot;, i.e. they failed. Then you code to make your tests &quot;green&quot;, i.e. passing.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>How&#39;d you two get your jobs without a degree? Wanting to do the same!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The easy way would be to roll the 3 dice 1000 times and record the results in the array. You can determine the probability of each roll using that data.</p>

<p>Each time you roll a 9 for example, you increase the count.</p>

<pre><code>arr[9]++;
</code></pre>

<p>You will be able to tell how many times each result occurred.</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> You could also generate every possible combination and arrive at the result mathematically.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Specifiers like <code>%s</code> work for the <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code> families of functions. Those functions treat their specifier strings specially; those are <em>formatted input/output</em> functions. You can&#39;t use specifiers like that just anywhere.</p>

<p>If you want to build a file name programmatically, then you&#39;re going to need to build it in a <code>char</code> array first, and then pass a pointer to the first element of that array to <code>fopen</code>. You&#39;re basically doing this already in the <code>text</code> array. If you want to concatenate <code>&quot;.txt&quot;</code> onto the end of that string, use the <code>strcat</code> function from <code>&lt;string.h&gt;</code>, and then pass <code>text</code> as the first argument to <code>fopen</code>.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>you can&#39;t use <code>&quot;%s.txt&quot;</code> in <code>fopen</code>.  you have to make the file name first using something like <code>strcat</code> or <code>sprintf</code> first.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yea ok, this may be a very stupid question but are Ionic and AngularJS ment to do? what are they for? Why do I have to learn both? he just keeps saying there powerfull..</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No one will look carefully at your post till you fix the formatting.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>From the user point of view, they can be similar. Internally, though, very different. Anyway, don&#39;t focus on PuTTY, it&#39;s a terminal emulator, and used for 10 billion other things besides developing Ionic apps. Learn Ionic and Angular.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A constructor is declared as follows:</p>

<pre><code>public ClassName(arguments) {
    // code
}
</code></pre>

<p>where ClassName is obviously the name of the class where you want to create the constructor. For example:</p>

<pre><code>public class Point {
    public Point() {
        // code goes here
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Usually, the constructor is used to initialize class variables:</p>

<pre><code>public class Point {

    protected int x, y;

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The constructor is called when the class is instantiated:</p>

<pre><code>Point point = new Point(1, 2);
</code></pre>

<p>Java allows overloaded methods, including constructors, so this syntax is allowed:</p>

<pre><code>public class Point {

    protected int x, y;

    public Point() {
        this(0, 0);
    }

    public Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, we have supplied a constructor with no arguments which will actually invoke the other constructor. So this code:</p>

<pre><code>Point point = new Point();
</code></pre>

<p>is equivalent to</p>

<pre><code>Point point = new Point(0, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>:)</p>

<p>Really <a href="/u/the_omega99">/u/the_omega99</a> covers it well.  Since you&#39;re learning how to program, you have the tools to change things, and Linux allows you to do that.  It may not be easy, but you can do it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The first most common complaint is getters and setters, which is hilarious because getters and setters are actually opposed to proper encapsulation and object orientation. We shouldn&#39;t be encouraging them or properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So instance variables shouldn&#39;t be made private? Doesn&#39;t that cause validation issues?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If your question is whether a program can execute another program, yes, you can.</p>

<p>For instance, in Java, you can use <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Runtime.html#exec(java.lang.String)"><code>Runtime.exec</code></a>.  In general, most programming languages call this function something along the lines of <code>exec</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>When you&#39;re done making this work (and you have tested it, and have test data), put aside a copy (or better yet, learn a version control system), and &quot;refactor&quot; this code.</p>

<p><a href="/u/CNotSoSharp">/u/CNotSoSharp</a> and <a href="/u/newaccount1236">/u/newaccount1236</a> have both given you a small window into making code more compact.  This is important from a maintainability, readability and expandability point.  You want your code to be compact, maintainable, readable and somewhat expandable <em>if</em> you know that something will change.  It&#39;s a fine line between making compact code and maintainable code.  You should get the practice now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, well, you don&#39;t use Ionic to make native Android apps, but you can use it make mobile web apps. Why not start <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">here</a>?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>thank you this helps! I didnt post all the code since i figured everything else is irrelevant. when i tried to extend the parent class, it gave me this compiler error.</p>

<p>no suitable constructor found for Point(no arguments)</p>

<p>that being said there are data members for both of the classes, how would i set up the constructor to extend the point class</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I meant making them is new not the command line obviously.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>We are using it to make android apps, it has something to do with it as he made apps in front of me and thats what our project is about.</p>

<p>We connect to our Azure virtual machines and use Ionic and AngularJS to make them, the thing is I can find no tutorials on how to go about this because It must be rare or new. He insists its the best way to make them that way tho so I guess its true but I dont know where to start.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can call a parent method using the <strong>super</strong> qualifier only if one class is a child of another. In you code, the classes Point and ArtilleryPiece are independent. They are not related to each other.</p>

<p>If you wanted to call the move method in the Point class from ArtilleryPiece, you would have to specify that ArtilleryPiece is a descendant of Point:</p>

<pre><code>class ArtilleryPiece extends Point {
    @Override
    public void move(double distance, double hAngle) {  
         super.move(distance, hAngle);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Also, unless the move method in ArtilleryPiece has different functionality from the parent, there is no need to override it. For example:</p>

<pre><code>class ArtilleryPiece extends Point {

}

ArtilleryPiece artillerPiece = new ArtilleryPiece();
artilleryPiece.move(1, 45);
</code></pre>

<p>Note that we haven&#39;t overriden the move method in ArtilleryPiece - but it doesn&#39;t matter. So long as a public implementation exists in the parent class, it can still be referenced by a child class.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yup. Till you run into a problem. Then it&#39;s not as okay. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>in python</p>

<pre><code>print &#39;I love you.&#39;

</div><div class="md"><p>In Brainfuck (probably not optimal, but oh well):</p>

<pre><code>&gt;+++++++[&lt;++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;+++.&gt;&gt;+++[&lt;++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;++.&lt;+++.+++.+++++++.&gt;&gt;++++[&lt;&lt;----&gt;&gt;-]&lt;&lt;-.&gt;.&gt;+++++[&lt;&lt;++++&gt;&gt;-]&lt;&lt;.&gt;&gt;+++++[&lt;&lt;--&gt;&gt;-]&lt;&lt;.++++++.&gt;&gt;++++++++++.
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your <code>ArtilleryPiece</code> class doesn&#39;t extend anything (so therefore it implicitly extends <code>Object</code>), and <code>Object</code> doesn&#39;t have a <code>move</code> method so <code>super.move</code> doesn&#39;t make any sense.</p>

<p>In object-oriented programming, a class can extend another class (e.g. <code>public class Knight extends ChessPiece</code>), which allows the class to inherit all the public and protected data members and methods of the super class.  If a class doesn&#39;t explicitly extend another class, then the class implicitly extends from <code>Object</code> -- therefore, all classes ultimately have <code>Object</code> as their &quot;root&quot; superclass.  <code>Object</code> has a few common methods, such as the <code>toString</code> and <code>equals</code> methods.</p>

<p>Classes can also implement interfaces.  For instance, <code>ArrayList</code> implements Java&#39;s <code>List</code> interface.</p>

In fact, after you&#39;ve been doing &quot;Junior Front End Development&quot; work, you might find that someone with 15-20 years software experience might still ask YOU questions.  What you would notice though might be the WAY the questions are asked by them to you.  It won&#39;t be &quot;How do I compare a substring?&quot; (well, it could...), it will probably be &quot;Do you have a library to handle strings in this app?&quot;, &quot;Should I use bare javascript, or use JQuery to do this?&quot;, etc.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll get there, but you have to remember that you will ALWAYS be Junior to someone else and/or some tech.  Keep learning.  With experience comes the ability to see how things are more alike, than different.</p>

<p>Edit:  You said you didn&#39;t have a degree.  While I don&#39;t like to extol the value of a degree, a lot of the theory and history of computer science is picked up in classes.  If you have learned on your own, you should go back to school (not saying you need to take out a mortgage to get it) and learn the theory.  It may give you some more insight into things.  One other thing:  In the last 20 years more levels of abstraction have been added to the programming paradigm, you need to &quot;play&quot; a little deeper if you truly want to understand things.  If you&#39;re happy connecting blocks together, then no need! </p>

<p>Java is a great language to learn about object orientated programming because java is very deeply rooted in the paradigm.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get too caught up on the java hate train. The first most common complaint is getters and setters, which is hilarious because getters and setters are actually opposed to proper encapsulation and object orientation. We shouldn&#39;t be encouraging them or properties.</p>

<p>The second most common complaint is verboseness, but being terse does not make a language good. It just means it is terse.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>a small problem here</p>

<p>rnd.Next(1,10); only allows for values 1-9. This means its impossible to fill each dimension of your array with unique values coming from that rnd.Next. 
This will likely cause you to have an infinite loop when trying to assign only unique values per dimension. You need to expand the range of allowed values (e.g. rnd.Next(1,11); )</p>

<p>i&#39;m not sure what you were trying to accomplish with the checknum array. a simpler solution (while keeping the core of your code)</p>

<pre><code>            int[,] arr2d = new int[10,10];
        Random rnd = new Random();

        for (int x = 0; x &lt; arr2d.GetLength(0); x++)
        {
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; arr2d.GetLength(1); y++)
            {
                var seeded = false;
                while (!seeded)
                {
                    int numb = rnd.Next(1, 11);
                    if(!Enumerable.Range(0, arr2d.GetLength(1)).Any(i =&gt; arr2d[x, i] == numb)){
                        arr2d[x, y] = numb;
                        seeded = true;
                    }
                }
            }
         }
</code></pre>

<p>there are better ways to do this, but that was a pretty small change to your existing code. It also allows you to increase the range of possible values. If you&#39;re not supposed to use linq, then just replace what the </p>

<pre><code>if(!Enumerable.Range(0, arr2d.GetLength(1)).Any(i =&gt; arr2d[x, i] == numb))
</code></pre>

<p>with a method call checking for uniqueness. I don&#39;t suggest just nesting another loop as you&#39;ve already gone beyond the &quot;good coding standard&quot; for nested blocks of code.</p>

<p>So to answer your question, MPI is between processes, and often also between machines. SSE is a single core, but issuing instructions that can operate on an array at once. You can think of it as a 8 robots controlled by a single controller that must operate in lockstep. At a very broad level, you can think of OpenMP as multiple-threaded computation, though it is capable of taking advantage of SSE.</p>

<p>Which you use depends on the code. You can have a code that uses all three, actually. SSE has only a single instruction stream, so you can&#39;t be executing different instructions using SSE/AVX. OpenMP cannot span machines, so you can only go up to the number of cores on a machine. On the downside, MPI has relatively high communication cost, so if you need a lot of communication, then you may not get much speedup.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The advert really does explain what someone trying to learn goes through. And the stages I really related to. As someone in IT but without a cs degree I definitely related to this article.  Mainly the amount of options and what to actually start to really learn next.</p>

I look at the giant knowledge gap and feel as if the jump from systems to software is looking like a trying to cross the Sahara with nothing but my birthday suit. </p>

That grad student just knows about unix/C++, he doesn&#39;t work on using it for scientific problems.

</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s just printing incorrectly. The <code>printf</code> function does not know anything about types. You are trying to use <code>%s</code> to print a <code>std::string</code> object but <code>%s</code> is designed for printing null-terminated character arrays. The mismatch is resulting in undefined behavior - anything can happen. It happens to be printing nonsense instead of crashing.</p>

<p>You can fix this by using <code>cout</code>.</p>

<pre><code>cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Card &quot; &lt;&lt; card &lt;&lt; &quot; is &quot; &lt;&lt; name &lt;&lt; &quot;.\n&quot;;

<pre><code>printf(&quot;Card %d is %s.\n&quot;, card, name.c_str());

<p>unfortunately setting the value of score to a high number does not guarantee success in the case that the user tests the limits of the program and acutally takes 1000000+ tries to guess the number.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You could initialize the best score to the maximum possible value. For example, if you&#39;re storing the score as an <code>int</code>, you could initialize it to <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code>. </p>

<p>If the user tests the limits by guessing more than <code>Integer.MAX_VALUE</code> times, you&#39;ll have other problems anyway (integer overflow). </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Icomoon is great too.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s because your variables aren&#39;t initialized.</p>

<p>Local variables (e.g. variables inside methods, etc..) are not auto initialized, local members are.</p>

<p>Had you declared your int variables outside of your method as Members/fields/properties you would not be getting the error you are.</p>

<p>that said, as the_omega99 stated your if statements are bad anyways. Essentially, the &quot;else if&quot; is causing only one of those if statements to ever be processed. </p>

<p>I think you were looking for something like:</p>

<pre><code>         string initialEntry;
        int entryTest0 = 0, entryTest1 = 0, entryTest2 = 0, entryTest3 = 0, entryTest4 = 0;

        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter your value: &quot;);
        initialEntry = Console.ReadLine();

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[0]))
        {
            entryTest0 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[0]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 1 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[1]))
        {
            entryTest1 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[1]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0 + entryTest1);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[2]))
        {
            entryTest2 = (int)Char.GetNumericValue(initialEntry[2]);
            Console.WriteLine(entryTest0 + entryTest1 + entryTest2);
        }

        if (initialEntry.Length &gt; 3 &amp;&amp; Char.IsNumber(initialEntry[3]))

<p>but there are easier ways to get the sum of the entered values. such as:</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Enums are classes, they&#39;re just a special type of class that&#39;s perfect for things like your Suit and Rank, where there are a small number of instances and <em>that&#39;s it</em>.  You wouldn&#39;t want Suit to be a class and have people calling the constructor to make their own.  Other examples might be difficulty level in a video game (with values EASY, NORMAL, HARD), piece types in chess (PAWN, ROOK, etc.), or really anything that you pick from in a UI using radio buttons.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a good example of a use for interfaces: my main personal project has this thing called a Trigger, and there are 3 distinct but separate places around the application that have a List&lt;Trigger&gt;, all of which need to be editable via the same editor dialog.  To make this editor multipurpose, it really just needs to be able to get and set the list of triggers from wherever.  So I made an interface:</p>

<pre><code>public interface HasTriggers {
  public List&lt;Trigger&gt; getTriggers();
  public void setTriggers(List&lt;Triggers&gt; newTriggers);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The dialog takes a HasTriggers in its constructor, uses getTriggers() to populate the UI for editing, and if OK is pressed, stores the list back with setTriggers(...).  The 3 places that need this editor just need to implement HasTriggers and the editor works with all of them.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I looked over your code more thoroughly because you mentioned &quot;formatting critique.&quot;  </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What is the meaning of <code>tester</code>? The name is not very descriptive. Additionally, your while loop is <code>while(tester == false)</code> which could be replaced by <code>while(!tester)</code>... this always evaluates true if tester is false. This could be a bit confusing to read, though. I would recommend something like <code>while(gameRunning)</code>, or any other suitable name.</p></li>
<li><p>The following code appears in your program four times. If you move the first instance of it to inside the top of the while loop, the user will be asked to guess every time without you needing to write it every time. You may need to restructure the branches a little bit.</p>

<pre><code>   System.out.print (&quot;guess a number between 1 and 100: &quot;);
       guess = input.nextInt();

</div><div class="md"><p>Your very first term is <code>-x^5</code>. You first replace all <code>-</code> with <code>+-</code>, which gives you <code>+-x^5</code>. Then you split on <code>+</code>, which gives you <code>[,-x^5]</code>. You pass the the empty string in the first element to be parsed as a monomial, splitting on <code>x^</code>, which just gives an empty string in the first element again, which you then try to parse as a number. You&#39;ll run into a similar issue with the second term where you&#39;ll split that into <code>[-, 5]</code> but <code>-</code> by itself is not a number.</p>

<p>They didn&#39;t even blink at it. Turned around and answered me right then and there. Spent the next hour being briefed on the technicals and snags in implementing such a thing. I learned quite a bit too.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The textbook answer will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your database table should have at least 4 columns: <code>userId</code>, <code>userName</code>, <code>salt</code>, <code>saltedHashedPassword</code>.</li>
<li>Having <code>userId</code> and <code>userName</code> be distinct allows the user to change their <code>userName</code> without issues.</li>
<li><code>userId</code> should be an identity column.</li>
<li>The primary key should be on <code>userId</code>.</li>
<li>A unique constraint should be on <code>userName</code>, so that <code>userName</code> is also distinct.</li>
<li>Then, the login form eventually submits the <code>userName</code>, <code>password</code> to the server.<br/></li>
<li>When creating a new user, you should create a new unique salt (the salt should be distinct for every user), and then compute the <code>saltedHashedPassword = HASH(password + salt)</code>, where <code>HASH</code> is a pre-written industry-standard password hashing function.  Then, you INSERT a new row into the table and return the new row&#39;s <code>userId</code>.  (In SQL Server, the query might look like <code>INSERT INTO users (userName, salt, saltedHashedPassword) SELECT @userName, @salt, @saltedHashedPassword  SELECT SCOPE_IDENTITY()</code>)</li>
<li>When an existing user tries to log in, you use their <code>userName</code> to look up the <code>salt</code> and <code>userId</code> (via a SELECT query <code>SELECT userId, salt FROM users WHERE userName = @userName</code>), and then compute the <code>saltedHashedPassword</code>.  Then, use another query to see if the <code>userId</code>&#39;s <code>saltedHashedPassword</code> matches what you computed.  (e.g. <code>SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE userId = @userId AND saltedHashedPassword = @saltedHashedPassword</code> and see if one row is returned vs zero rows)</li>
<li>When writing SQL queries, best practice is for all queries to be parameterized queries.  It looks like your code already is using parameterized queries, so that&#39;s nice.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, you want to always store the very first result no matter what the user scored.

<p>Second, range(a, b + 1) will give you all integers between a and b+1, <em>including</em> a, but <em>excluding</em> b+1, which means i will be 18 in the last iteration. (since while b &lt; 19, b becomes 18 and so does i)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Rather than creating a bunch of specialized classes, perhaps consider using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy Pattern</a>. Create various &quot;strategy&quot; interfaces (e.g. NetworkingStrategy, SpecialEffectStrategy), and then have class A utilize those strategies. For example:</p>

<pre><code>// Instead of a specialized AWithSpecialEffect class:
A obj1 = new A(
    new BasicSpecialEffectStrategy(), 
    new NoNetworkingStrategy());

// Instead of a specialized AWithSpecialEffectAndNetworkSupport class:
A obj2 = new A(
    new BasicSpecialEffectStrategy(), 
    new BasicNetworkingStrategy());
</code></pre>

<p>Then, in the A class, wherever you might have special effects, for example, you can do something like: </p>

<pre><code>specialEffectStrategy.doSpecialEffects(); 
</code></pre>

<p>You can use the Builder pattern to use reasonable defaults, then you only need to change whatever is special, rather than specifying all the strategies in the constructor: </p>

<pre><code>ABuilder builder = new ABuilder();
builder.useBasicSpecialEffects();
A obj1 = builder.build();

But I think this article here covers a lot of practical difference to be aware of when learning/programming between the two:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.dickbaldwin.com/java/Java008.htm">http://www.dickbaldwin.com/java/Java008.htm</a></p>

<p>If you flip through any C++ book or tutorial,you read about decision control statements, how to write classes, OOP stuff, etc. It&#39;ll look very familiar and you&#39;ll quickly see the syntax required to write it correctly. </p>

<p>You&#39;ll eventually run into things you don&#39;t think you seen before like pointers or using new/delete to allocate memory, but really you experienced iit n Java that before too. Pointer works like reference in Java but just allows you to have a finer control over it (like doing pointer arithmetic). New/delete is done in Java too, just not by you but by the JVM garbage collector.</p>

<p>This is a C program where the code says I love you at the end, and if you run it it outputs &quot;I love you!&quot;</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks this actually makes me feel a lot better about getting out there into the real world. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your community college: 1
My supposedly computer foreword university: 0</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yup.  Figured that out after posting.   I also realized I needed to us this so  the effect would only apply to one div at a  time </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Problem solving / bug finding is something I&#39;m good at. I&#39;m a pro at getting something that&#39;s broken to work again with the desired result. It&#39;s new projects I think that scare me more. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your if-else statements have overlap that will likely result in behavior you don&#39;t want (I think -- I&#39;m not entirely sure what you&#39;re trying to do and you neglected to mention that).</p>

<p>If the input string is non empty and the first character is a number, you&#39;ll go into the first branch. You&#39;ll never go into the others unless the character at the index being checked isn&#39;t a number. So if the input is &quot;1234&quot;, you&#39;ll go into the first if branch. And that&#39;s it, because if-else statements go into the first branch that they can.</p>

<p>I think you want your else-ifs in the reverse order. ie, check for the longest string first, if that fails, try the next size. Although your code doesn&#39;t really do anything useful, so there may be a better approach depending on what exactly you&#39;re trying to (gotta mention that -- it&#39;s important).</p>

<p>As an aside, you shouldn&#39;t have an empty else statement. That does nothing. Why does it exist?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It compiled fine, but it kept filling parts of the 2d array with zeros.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I undid the code for that :/</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As I said, I am not that familiar with C#, but if you show the complete code you already have, we can troubleshoot.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmm, for some reason it&#39;s not wanting to cooperate</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://materialdesignicons.com">http://materialdesignicons.com</a> :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You forgot the main.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Makes sense</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Saved. I will read this later because I am interested in this topic. Will report back with my opinion!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m no web expert, but it&#39;s probably because you&#39;re using id instead of class. I&#39;d change id = &quot;older&quot; to class = &quot;older&quot; and use a period instead of # for your jQuery selector. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re calling [1,2,3].second which is returning &#39;2&#39; and then doing...Absolutely nothing with it. How about printing out the returned result?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Im not using arguments now and using <strong>self[]</strong> instead.
Now my code looks like this: </p>

<pre><code>class Array
    def second
        return self[1]
   end
end

a = [1, 2, 3]
a.second
</code></pre>

<p>But i still get <em>[Finished in 0.3s]</em> and nothing else. Whats wrong now?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>System.out.print(&quot;I love you&quot;);</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>PHPUnit is the most common testing framework.  <a href="https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html">https://phpunit.de/getting-started.html</a></p>

<p>PHP is often tested but how much depends on the developer/company.  Many packages come with a set of unit tests you can build from.  symfony2 does a good job at writing unit tests that are worth learning from.  </p>

<p>A good way to learn to write tests is write a bunch of tests every time you fix a bug.  Eventually you&#39;ll learn what tests you should have written up front to catch those bugs.</p>

<p>Dirty? PHP is not a strict language like Java, however you could consider moving to HHVM/HACK if you feel safer with strict typing.</p>

<p>Also check out r/php</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Me too, general 70s &amp; 80s :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In the if blocks,  your 2*A &#39;s need parentheses. Do you have to to do the imaginary case too? It looks good but I havent ran it, just read it. Also, you are calculating the descriminant 3 times. There is a way to only do it once. </p>

<p>My final suggestion is to out everything in a while loop and ask them if they want to exit or try again. </p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

<pre><code> bool noexit=1;
 char response=0;

 while(noexit){
      //code
      cout&lt;&lt;&quot;Would you like to enter another triple? (Y or N&quot;&lt;&lt;endl;
      cin&gt;&gt; response;
      if (response !=&#39;Y&#39;){
           noexit=0;
      }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>There are a couple ways to make that better which I will leave to you, but for simple programs like this it makes testing them easier. At least for me. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>How about the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/be21c7hw%28v=vs.94%29.aspx">ternary operator</a>?</p>

<p>I think that fits your description exactly.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ok, there are a few problems with your code:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#39;second&#39; shouldn&#39;t take any arguments: you should just call it and it should return the second element (or nil), so there&#39;s no reason for it to take an arg</li>
<li>&#39;array&#39; isn&#39;t defined anywhere: you&#39;re monkey-patching the array class so you should use the built-in Array methods to access the elements within (i.e. &#39;self[]&#39;).</li>
<li>You&#39;re not printing out the returned value from the call to &#39;a.second&#39;</li>
<li>Two space tabs are the way forward</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks dude! I&#39;ll look into that and take the first step into my goal!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t understand why  this thread has 170 replies but nobody has commented on the fact that getMoreMoneyFromCustomer() on line 49 is always called?</p>

<pre><code>double finalPrice = product - paid;
    if (finalPrice &lt; product) {
        getMoreMoneyFromCustomer(paid);
    }
</code></pre>

<p>It seems like the logic error there is at least worth a mention.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t hit me because I&#39;m not that fit in C# (but luckily the syntax is similar to Java, so I think that I could manage):</p>

<p>The whole routine should just be in the same place where you fill your 2d array:</p>

<pre><code>bool[] alreadyUsed = new bool[10] // this will make an array 0-9 inclusive
Random random = new Random(); // the random number generator

int randomNumber;

// the following code should be inside the method where you fill the 2d Array 

do { // this loop ensures that no duplicate random numbers will be drawn
    randomNumber = random.Next(0, 10);
} while (alreadyUsed[randomNumber];

// set the alreadyUsed flag to true
alreadyUsed[randomNumber] = true;

// Here, the code to fill your actual 2D array would go
// randomNumber would be the number to put in your array

</div><div class="md"><p>Here is the code I came up with!</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Whoop! I meant subreddit, not thread within <a href="/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a>. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, for one thing, the bare bone basics of the OS are not very different from Windows, so a pure beginner can pickup Linux and more or less use it as well as they could use Windows. I&#39;m referring to the generate navigation of the OS and running programs within it. Most beginners probably aren&#39;t familiar with how Windows does things like syscalls or the terminal, anyway.</p>

<p>So, why Linux?</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Better terminal and shells. Beginner programmers for most languages will be writing console programs, so a strong terminal and shell is very useful here. And IMO, a beginner programmer should learn the basics of a terminal and shell before they learn to program.</p></li>
<li><p>Comes with everything many programmers need. With Windows, you gotta install the compiler and such first. For Linux, some of the most popular languages are basically &quot;ready to go&quot;. For example, GCC and G++ are preinstalled in every Linux distro I&#39;ve seen, making it easier to jump into developing with those languages. You can focus on learning to program and not on installing dependencies.</p></li>
<li><p>Speaking of dependencies, the package manager that many Linux distros have (particularly apt-get) makes it easy to get tools for other languages. Want to learn Python? <code>apt get install python3</code> and you&#39;re ready to go.</p></li>
<li><p>Some would argue that Linux makes interacting with the OS easier. I&#39;m not so sure about this. The Windows API is quite extensive and often higher level than the POSIX standard that Linux follows. Although being POSIX compatible means that you can use the same code for many OSes. Heck, certain versions of Windows are even POSIX compliant (I have no idea why Microsoft has decided to hide this in the &quot;regular people version&quot; of Windows).</p></li>
<li><p>Let&#39;s be honest: a large reason for people to advocate Linux is because they support the free and open source software movement, of which Linux is a marvelous flagship of. It&#39;s a piece of FOSS that is so crucial that companies even pay people to develop for it and it&#39;s used for personal and commercial use worldwide. Many programmers identify strongly with this ideology, so advocate Linux.</p></li>
<li><p>Linux is made by programmers with other programmers in mind. This is really distro dependent. Some are more dumbed down than others. But most of them afford the user more customization and choice than Windows or OS X. For example, Windows thinks that you shouldn&#39;t be able to change file extensions without a warning. There&#39;s no way to disable this warning. This is obviously a feature for less technical users who don&#39;t understand file extensions and accidentally changing the extension would likely result in them being unable to open the file. Most halfway technical people don&#39;t have this problem, and this isn&#39;t a &quot;feature&quot; I&#39;ve seen in any Linux distro.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There&#39;s other advantages of Linux, but I would think that these are the biggest ones for why someone would advocate Linux to beginners. I think #5 is probably the strongest point for most people. After all, Windows has PowerShell to combat point #1. Point #2 is quite minor (you only set things up once and there&#39;s no guarantee that you&#39;re in developing in one of these languages). Point #3 is remedied by some third party Windows package managers. #4 doesn&#39;t apply to the POSIX compatible versions of Windows (off the top of my head, I know Win 7 Ultimate is). And #6 is more for experienced programmers than beginners.</p>

<p>EDIT: One other advantage of using Linux is the case sensitivity of the file system. This is just plain good practice, since programming languages are usually case sensitive. Not to mention that having a case sensitive file system means that you&#39;ll be less likely to accidentally make your programs incompatible with Linux.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s seems like a good idea, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if my professor took off quite a few points for it. He&#39;s really particular and wants us to check it against all the other numbers in the array</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your comments are as unclear as your code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your names are perfect.  For something that small one package is fine, and multiple source folders are only needed for majorly separate things (a big application may have a src folder and a test folder, for example).</p>

<p>It probably makes sense to have your Suit and Rank enums inside the Card class, and have them be public and static.  That way outside code can see them, but they&#39;re clearly part of Card.</p>

<p>When you ask about interfaces, I assume you mean that abominable pattern where people make a goddamn &quot;I[whatever]&quot; interface with a corresponding &quot;[whatever]Impl&quot; class.  That&#39;s stupid bullshit that I think comes from C++ programmers, who are used to having separate header and implementation files.  Interfaces are used to specify common functionality, nothing more.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use tlbexp.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I use Pyscripter instead of IDLE: <a href="https://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/">https://code.google.com/p/pyscripter/</a>  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Something like this?</p>

<p>static bool DoesExist(int randomnumber)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>int[] doeshave = new bool [9] //all randoms will be 1 - 9 inclusive </p>

<p>for (int x = 0; x &lt; 10; x++)</p>

<p>return false;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>else</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>return true;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>I know it doesn&#39;t utilize a boolean array like you said, but I&#39;ve never actually used one of those, and honestly, I&#39;m not quite sure how they operate.</p>

<p>But would something like this work?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No I&#39;m talking bollocks. Stick with what you got. </p>

<p>the address of head. You&#39;ll need to then point your listPtr at the head again, because it&#39;s changed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>was CLI literally just a way to make C++ and C# talk to each other?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. C++/CLI was created to be a 1st class CLI language alongside C#. This didn&#39;t work out for a long list of reasons. So it&#39;s now primarily used for interop scenarios only.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Functors can be many different things, so no.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why not create a CLI application they do, perhaps look at things they do or even you do that could be sped up by having a program automate some of it :)</p>

<p>Of course, downvotes for trying to help. Always the same on this sub.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about the modulus.  Your integer division and subtraction was also correct, and I don&#39;t think any more complicated to understand.  I think the other issues are larger.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If the range of possible numbers is not too large, fill an array with those numbers, shuffle the array, and then populate your two-dimensional array using the beginning of the shuffled array.</p>

<p>For the shuffle, you can use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">Fisher–Yates shuffle</a>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh yeah. &#39;Nice to haves&#39; in most places means &#39;things management doesn&#39;t think are important even though without them you are shooting yourself in the foot.&#39;</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>GNU/Linux and OS X are both inspired by/based off Unix, which was designed to be an operating system for programmers, rather than an operating system for consumers (as Windows is). It&#39;s a nicer experience basically, especially for C programming (C and Unix were developed by the same team around the same time).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I know its not instrumental music But i have for 15 years in the business I use 80&#39;s Rock songs</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are several ways to achieve this.</p>

<p>A possible way is to generate a second (boolean) array that covers exactly the range of your random numbers.</p>

<p>As soon as a random number is generated, check it against that array using the random number as index. If it is not set, set it, otherwise if it was set, create a new random number.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure you can think of the obvious solution:</p>

<pre><code>for i = 0 to array.size
    generatedNumber = random()
    while generatedNumber in array[0 : i]
        generatedNumber = random()
    array[i] = generatedNumber
</code></pre>

<p>Since these are numbers, you could speed things up at the cost of extra memory by using a binary search tree to figure out if the number is already in use.</p>

<p>Of note is that the run time of this algorithm will increase with the size of the array, since you&#39;ll have more collisions. For small arrays, you can expect a low number of collisions, and close to O(n<sup>2</sup>) time with the above approach or O(n log n) time with a binary search.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not familiar with any PRNG algorithms that could ensure uniqueness of their numbers (and that doesn&#39;t sound very random), so this approach is probably as good as you&#39;ll get.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Really?! Thank you! That&#39;s the nicest thing someone&#39;s ever said to me, hahaha. I tried in vain for very long, but I think I finally got my theme to work properly! Thanks anyways, though!! (: </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, well, one problem is that you never write to <code>produtList</code> at all. Your <code>leituraProdutos</code> function writes to <code>clientList</code>, not <code>produtList</code>. This destroys the information that was in <code>clientList</code> and leaves <code>produtList</code> completely empty.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Of course. There&#39;s a number of libraries and pieces of software that are stable and haven&#39;t been modified for years because they aren&#39;t looking to expand.</p>

<p>With that said, if you <em>do</em> happen to find a bug, you&#39;re probably on your own. Then again, finding a bug will often not have a quick fix from the library developer, anyway. So it&#39;s not a really big deal, IMO.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The easiest thing to do is to assign them values when you declare them. Then they will never be uninitialized.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I understand that but I don&#39;t have no idea how solve this...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In your <code>leituraCompras</code> function, you pass the values of <code>mes</code> and <code>unidades</code> to <code>testeValidade</code>. But those variables might not be initialized when you do that. It is possible that the variables <code>mes</code> and <code>unidades</code> are never assigned values before they are passed to <code>testeValidade</code>.</p>

<p>Attempting to use the value of an uninitialized variable is a serious mistake. It means that your program has undefined behavior, which means that you have absolutely no guarantees about the behavior of any part of your program.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>LOL java.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no way to make java look &quot;neat&quot;, regardless of how much effort you put into it.</p>

<p>java is the most bureaucratic language currently in use, put forward by the most bureaucratic corporation in history. There&#39;s no &quot;neat&quot;, only boring useless boilerplate and ask toolbars and random crapware everywhere, for oracle&#39;s profit.</p>

<p>If you want a &quot;neat&quot; environment, try C# and Visual Studio.</p>

<p>If you want to stick to the JVM, try something else such as Kotlin or Scala.</p>

<p>java sucks.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>ok I resolve this mistake but i have this error now and I don&#39;w know why I can solve him...</p>

<p>Sorry for not posting before... </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry about that I never knew how to do it right I always assumed reddit automatically formatted the code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Cool -- distributing your work is very easy in C++. All you have to do is compile your code -- once you compile your C++ file, your compiler should generate an executable file (something ending in .exe, if you&#39;re on Windows).</p>

<p>Then, all you have to do is send that exe to whoever wants to use your program, and you&#39;re basically done. You might have to end up doing a bit more work if your program is more complex and has a lot of dependencies/uses a lot of libraries, and you&#39;ll need to compile your program separately for each major operating system (so if you compile your program on windows, it&#39;ll only really work on windows), but for the most part just compiling your file should suffice.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Rather then asking us, I think it would be much more efficient if you just emailed the advisers at that particular college and ask them what the differences between the two programs are.</p>

<p>The job titles &quot;programmer&quot; and &quot;programmer-analyst&quot; are incredibly vague, and have so much cross-over that it&#39;s impossible to accurately predict what the differences between those two courses are without more info to work with.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>At my current job we do not have a formal process, so everyone treats code review differently, and it&#39;s awful.</p>

<p>Some treat it as an opportunity to catch issues and learn. They&#39;ll accept feedback and post their updates until everyone is satisfied. That&#39;s great.</p>

<p>Some treat it as an inconvenience they have to go through in order to get a rubber stamp on what they&#39;ve already decided. They do not readily accept feedback and only rationalize, not even justify, their original code. That&#39;s terrible.</p>

<p>Some people push their code to the repo before sending out the review, which usually leads to a string of useless commit messages as they address CR comments. Some people use patches to post reviews and updates before it ever hits the repo.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are politics and egos at play so it&#39;s a nightmare trying getting an actual process in place.</p>

<p>I preferred the system at my last job where everyone sent a review before code went to the repository, got at least two others to do the review, and had to post updates until everyone marked &quot;ship it&quot;. Commit messages had to have the names of the people who signed off, or at least the CR id. That worked incredibly well for us.</p>

<p>The best code reviews tend not to be memorable, which is nice. They have a small set of changes, they&#39;ve explained the purpose of their changes in a description, and the code is clear. Everybody in the review is responsive to questions and changes. They often take less than 15 minutes total.</p>

<p>The worst code reviews are memorable. Two come to mind.</p>

<p>The first was a really complicated set of changes that merged 3 features into one giant review, required knowledge of our legacy systems and their interactions, and required attending architecture reviews to understand what was being attempted. The code was messy and extremely buggy and spread out across 4 different modules. The dev who wrote it was the kind who only wanted to get a rubber stamp and would not accept feedback.</p>

<p>That review took 4 weeks and 40 cumulative developer hours to complete. In the end, none of the devs wanted to sign off on either the architecture or the review, but it still got checked in. Then after 3 weeks (!) of testing it went out and brought down our site.</p>

<p>The other review was smaller in scope, but also done by a dev who would not accept feedback. It had performance concerns, maintainability concerns, and introduced an obvious way for any of our users to exploit our site. The dev never posted an update, decided they were done hearing comments, closed the review, merged everything in, and cut a release with all those concerns still in place. It&#39;s an escalating battle to keep it from going out.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#39;s tough to google something if you don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called. The key word to remember here is &quot;append&quot;, which means to add to the end.</p>

<p>The important part to note in the example is the mode that the file is being opened in. In most languages, when you open a file, you pick a mode. Read, write... blah blah. Often &quot;write&quot; defaults to writing to the beginning of a file. There is usually a mode to append to the end. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As for installing ipython (on windows), I recommend just using one of the big ol&#39; installer packages like <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">anaconda&#39;s distribution</a>. It has python2 and python3 versions. I wouldn&#39;t really overthink which one you should use.</p>

<p>As for the installation process, make sure you check the box that says something to the respect of, &quot;add Anaconda, ipython to your PATH variable?&quot; </p>

<p>Make sure this is checked. Once it&#39;s installed, you just go to your Start menu, and type out iPython, and the &quot;notebook&quot; opens up in a new tab on your default browser.</p>

<p>Good luck :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Unit testing involves testing a single piece of functionality.  As well as proving correctness they also enforce good design as tightly coupled code is difficult to unit test.  I typically use JUnit for java unit testing.</p>

<p>Integration testing is testing that the different pieces work together.</p>

<p>Functional testing is automated user activity. I use selenium a lot for this as you can test that simulate user activity and automate user testing.</p>

<p>Regression testing is writing tests that prove a bug then going out and fixing it.  It ensures the bug doesn&#39;t return later down the track.</p>

<p>Test driven development (TDD) is writing tests first then coding from red to green. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>You are trying to read a string into a single char (name).  There is not enough space for that, unless the string is zero characters (don&#39;t forget the extra null termination character).</p></li>
<li><p>When you do:</p>

<p>struct City x = { &amp;name, latitude, longitude};</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You now have x-&gt;name pointing to a memory location on the stack (a pointer to name).  When you return from that function that memory location is no longer valid, and could contain anything.  You were closer then struct City::name was a char[20]</p>

<p>Also, your compiler error is indecipherable on Reddit.  You need better formatting.  I think it&#39;s because you are using -&gt; on something that isn&#39;t a pointer, so you should be using .</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That is not true, most programs are subscription based, such as CryEngine. From the sounds of it you are still early in your developing career. I wouldn&#39;t worry about royalties right away. Also consider that most platforms where you could publish your game are also taking cuts from it. If it&#39;s a mobile game Google Play and App Store take a 40% cut if I recall correctly AND want money from you just to be able to publish. Steam takes also a pretty hug cut. Appreciate the work that went into those engines. If you want to use Unity (which also charges you once you make more than 100k a year) because you prefer the engine then go for unity. But choosing unity over UE4 because you think the 5% royalties are greedy is just retarded. Also you only get the 5% charged once you make over 3k in a quarter, and those 5% don&#39;t include the first 3k. So if you make 4k the you are being charged but only 50 dollars (five percent of one thousand dollars)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I would recommend learning c++ before you learn c#.  I used c++ all throughout college and then got a job programming in c#.  It was so easy to learn and was like a dream come true in terms of ease of use.  The reverse will absolutely not be the same.  c++ requires you to think about a lot more. </p>

<p>It seems like your trying to skip a few steps here.  Someone mentioned learning c# through intellisense(I kind of did too, but I also looked up a lot on MSDN). If you don&#39;t know what intellisense is you should just google it. Part of programming is finding solutions and answers on your own.  If you can&#39;t figure it out then ask for help.  </p>

<p>To answer your question. Yes there a plenty of free online sources documenting almost everything you&#39;ll need.  </p>

<p>Here is what I recommend if you want to learn c#
-read the documentation on MSDN. Just browse through the methods for the common variable types so you can think back to them later.<br/>
-go to <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer/">/r/dailyprogrammer/</a> They have daily programming challenges for all levels (easy, medium, and difficult).  This will give you three projects that you can practice on every day.  Then you can post your solutions and get feedback. </p>

<p>here is the book I used in college. it is 122 dollars cheaper than the latest edition. The book is probably five dollars so you can&#39;t go wrong.  At least this book wont start off by telling you to learn another language. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>If you bought a book to learn C++ then just pull through and learn C++. Once you know the language and its functions it will be fairly easy to learn new OO languages such as C# or Java. Also lets be fair: 5% royalties is really not that much considering how much game engines cost. Look at the professional versions of Unity of programs like 3ds Max.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Most of the time you never need globals in well written code.  For example for yours the only thing you would ever need to pass to anything is the total they have given you or the change owed.  You would use the constants in the local scope.  </p>

<p>The reason you avoid globals is because while it works in something small like this when you get to a decent sized program like what you would use in a real world case it actually gets very very confusing and hard to read if you have 1000 global variables.  Globals also have some other issues as well.</p>

<p>Now when the hell do I start making my own stuff?</p>

</blockquote>

<p>I guess this seems to be your problem. What specifically do you struggle with? It&#39;s always best to break down a solution into mini problems and tackle them individually.</p>

<p>I would recommend getting better at graphics, at least to a point where you are happy with how it looks even if it&#39;s just a prototype. Even if your project isn&#39;t fully functional, a well made prototype can really help you make a statement and demonstrate it&#39;s potential.</p>

<p>When it comes to games, keep it simple but beautiful. The most recent example of this philosophy (in my opinion) is Darkest Dungeon. The game is beautiful but the mechanics behind it are really easy to mimic and I believe the fellows over at Unity have even produced tutorials on how to build your own rogue-like game.</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty hard these days to <em>not</em> do something that has already been done before but that is really a good thing. As a programmer, you don&#39;t want to be recreating the wheel. You could argue that any recent first person shooter game is just a Doom clone... it&#39;s up to you to use your imagination and build on existing (successful) ideas and make it better.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what I&#39;ve heard as well. And try not to blame them too harshly. It&#39;s not easy/nice getting languages like C++ and a scripting language bound together. From what I&#39;ve heard from folks who&#39;ve used it, it&#39;s pretty good. </p>

<p>I can tell you from my experience researching Python binding, and doing actual binding for node.js that it can be quite hellish. Lots of global state (more than simply registering factories or whatever), or just crazy solutions to problems. </p>

<p>For my teams game project, we&#39;re using a language a guy in our schools R&amp;D department created. It&#39;s not perfect, but I like (most of) the syntax, and it&#39;s binding is pretty great. Although to be fair, the guy who wrote it taught me himself, so I probably shouldn&#39;t bitch too much about the v8 or Python issues. I&#39;m sure the v8 binding problems I&#39;ve run into would be much easier if I were both taught by the v8 guys and had a direct line to them for questions. </p>

I move back and forth daily between a standard dell laptop using Qwerty and my work desktop with a Typematrix keyboard using Dvorak. There is a giant learning curve with Dvorak of course, but because of the different key spacing, context change (lappy to Desktop, position change (on lap, sitting to a standing desk), and of course the fact that there is only minimal overlap in key placement, it is very easy to flip a switch in my brain to use one at the other without incident.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an anecdote, sure, but perhaps the context change from a Mac to PC would be enough if you changed keyboard layouts more drastically so that you brain sees them as two separate phenomena, rather than the same with very specific exceptions.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>M_PI is usually defined in math.h, find it (usually in /usr/include/math.h ) and check if M_PI is defined in here.</p>

<p>On my linux machine, M_PI is indeed defined there, but in a block protected by:</p>

<pre><code>#if defined __USE_BSD || defined __USE_XOPEN
</code></pre>

<p>So check if __USE_BSD is true in your program (it is by default for me...)</p>

Personally I was confused, but this explaination were very helpfull. If there is something I don&#39;t understand, I try to test the example, and compile them. And I pretty much test all I can to see the &quot;reaction&quot; of the compiler (error or not) and the result.</p>

<p>What confused me is that the symbols * and &amp; means different things based on where they are used.</p>

<p>because that&#39;s a silly thing to look for? AFAIK the wikibook on Ada is decent. I&#39;m sure your university&#39;s library should have books on Ada as well.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p><code>M_PI</code> is not part of the C language standard (I think it&#39;s from unix or something), and is instead a nonstandard extension that some implementations like the GNU C library implements.</p>

<p>The most portable way is probably to make your own PI constant.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Actual tests, like college tests? not really. There is a huge industry around that (certifications) and people who write practice tests and questions really only do so to capitalize.</p>

<p>Certifications are a touchy subject on reddit. Some say yes, some say no.</p>

<p>IMO, certifications are good to prove you know a language, but knowing a language is barely a quarter the battle. Knowing how to program is very different than knowing a language.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Get your inputs into character buffer <code>in_a</code> and <code>in_b</code>, and make a character buffer for your sum:</p>

<pre><code>#define NDIG 50
char in_a[NDIG+1], in_b[NDIG+1], sum[NDIG+1];
     /* ^ Stored in MSD-first ASCII */
</code></pre>

<p>Ensure that the numbers are right-justified, so that (e.g.) 25 is represented as <code>&quot;0</code><sup>48 times</sup><code>25\0&quot;</code> and not just <code>&quot;25\0&quot;</code>.  Assuming an un-justified string is in <code>str</code>, you justify this with the following (using <code>in_a</code> as the example—you probably want to make a function instead):</p>

<pre><code>const size_t len = strlen(str);
assert(len &lt;= NDIG);
memcpy(in_a + NDIG - len, str, len+1);
if(len &lt; NDIG)
    memset(in_a, &#39;0&#39;, NDIG - len);
</code></pre>

<p>Now, do exactly what you do when you add on paper: Iterate over the digits from least-significant (@end of array) to most-significant (@start), keeping track of a 1-or-0 carry and adding that in as you move on.</p>

<pre><code>int i;
unsigned char carry; /*or bool, or whatever*/
for(carry=0, i=NDIG-1; i &gt;= 0; i--)
{
    /* Pull the digit values out: */
    const unsigned char a = in_a[i] - &#39;0&#39;;
    const unsigned char b = in_b[i] - &#39;0&#39;;

    /* Compute an intermediate sum, which may have a value from 0 to 18 */
    unsigned char c = carry + a + b;

    /* Set the carry to 1 iff the result is &gt;=10, and subtract 10 to ensure
     * the result is only one decimal digit. */
    if(!!(carry = (c &gt;= 10)))
        c -= 10;

    /* Store the result in the output array, adding &#39;0&#39; to re-ASCIIfy it. */
    sum[i] = c + &#39;0&#39;;
}
/* Terminate the sum string. */
sum[NDIG] = &#39;\0&#39;;
</code></pre>

<p>Now you have a 50-digit string you can print out directly.  Of course, you’ll usually want to find the first nonzero digit and start printing there instead:</p>

<pre><code>const char *sump;
for(sump = sum; sump &lt; sum + NDIG-1 &amp;&amp; *sump == &#39;0&#39;; sump++)
    (void)0;
puts(sump);
</code></pre>

<p>To be honest, university is just a waste of time in my opinion. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It normally is. I think in the future, universities will be institutions where people who want to pursue research go to. Not where people go to learn. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>as I do not know any algorithms, design patterns or object orientation</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you don&#39;t know algorithms, design patterns and object oriented programming, then you did get robbed. These are the basics you learn in the first year before you start tackling advanced topics as OS, compilers, databases, networks, theory of computation, cryptography, etc. If you don&#39;t know the basics, how are you hoping to get past the face-to-face interviews? </p>

<p>The only way you&#39;ll be hired is if you are a girl. The standards are so much lower for women, but then again in a recession, they&#39;re the first to be let go since they are absolutely useless. Otherwise, you are going to face immense difficulties, ESPECIALLY since you quit your fucking job AND you lack the basics!</p>

<p>My advice is take some time and brush up on the basics of algorithms, design patterns and OO programming concepts.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Read the FAQ first, then come back if you have more specific questions.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m using, but it&#39;s still a whole different world from java&#39;s methods.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Quick fix: Find and replace &quot;-&gt;&quot; for &quot;.&quot;. This is because when you&#39;re accessing elements of a structure, you use &quot;.&quot;. You use &quot;-&gt;&quot; when you&#39;re dealing with pointers.</p>

<p>Not-so-quick-yet-still-quick fix: I would not recommend passing whole structures as arguments. Pass pointers to structures. It may be trickier if you&#39;re not used to pointers, but it&#39;s good practice. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The C++ book recommended that you learn C# first?! I find that hard to believe. If you don&#39;t know either, and want to use Unity, then definitely go for C#. But I don&#39;t recommend learning C# first as a path to C++.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Maybe try something like <a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Tips/318140/How-to-make-a-callback-to-Csharp-from-C-Cplusplus">this</a>? I used to do a lot of c++/c# interop and generally the default marshaling of strings is pretty good.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Without looking at your code because the other comment seems to give you a lot of positive feedback already, if you want to update the variable when the object is created,  I would create a method called calculateAverages that takes in an array of students and outputs the average.  Call this method after the new student is created.  </p>

<p>Theoretically you could also  use a global average variable and update it from the student constructor,  but this seems like bad design to me.  The average concept is separate from the student concept.  And creating a general method would allow you to change what students are actually added to the input to create the average.

That element would inherit its parent&#39;s styles in the absence of anything matching it, but that&#39;s not the case — the anchor element has two competing selectors that match it, and the winner is chosen by the one that has a higher <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#specificity">specificity</a>.  The importance of the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> selector doesn&#39;t matter here because there is only the one selector that targets that element, so there is nothing for it to override.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Sure, I&#39;ve just done research on it myself after looking at this thread, so let me explain it as best I can.</p>

<p>p is a prime &gt; 3. So how does p<sup>2</sup> -1 relate to it? Well, p<sup>2</sup> -1 is the same thing is (p+1)(p-1). </p>

<p>For any prime number if we look at p+1 and p-1 we are guaranteed to get an even number with a factor of 2, and the other even number will have a factor of 4. And for any consecutive set of 3 integers, one of them must have a factor of 3. And we know it&#39;s not p, since p is prime. So for p+1 and p-1 we are guaranteed a factor of 2, 3, and 4. 2 * 3 * 4 = 24. </p>

<p>So for any prime number p, p<sup>2</sup> - 1 will divide 24 evenly. The problem is that there are nonprimes that this is also true for, making it pretty useless. </p>

<pre><code>struct City *x;
x = malloc(sizeof(struct City));

<p>Then this allocates space for your city on the heap, so you can read from stdin and assign stuff.  Make sure you free the struct when you are done with it, or you will have memory leaks.</p>

<p>Edit: In general you want to keep things off the heap as much as possible.  If your program structure allows it, instead declare your function as:</p>

<pre><code>void readCity(struct City* x) {
  // Fill x with values from stdin
}

<p>Then when you call it, you do:</p>

<li>1- so it would be something like :

Right?</li>
<li>2- yes.</li>
<li>3- I know its implications.. i don&#39;t want to check for type equality.. But I know javascripy coders like to always use ===</li>
<li>4- I&#39;ll implement throw catch</li>
<li>5- constructor functions ? To my knowledge, constructor functions are functions called on object initalisation.. What are the constructor functions here ? I&#39;ll change the name of the object instance.</li>
<li>6- can you give me an example of unconcise code I wrote ?</li>

<p>Question (please answer frankly) would you hire me if you had to decide based only on this problem solution?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well Xamarin runs on iOS and Android, Java doesn&#39;t run on iOS. I&#39;m not 100% of the process of porting the C# to iOS once you have done the Android version but from my understanding, Xamarin promotes the idea of keeping your business logic entirely independent of the GUI anyway, which is a good thing. So you would just need to work on the GUI part once you&#39;d got the code done.</p>

<p>This image on their site explains it better: <a href="http://imgur.com/z8fOocN">http://imgur.com/z8fOocN</a></p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It seems to be a backlash against a particular kind of style that I&#39;m unaware of. The author seemed to come across lots of classes that had no state, and existed just to provide a function. But isn&#39;t this because everything in Java has to be in a class? (I don&#39;t know Java.) In C++, in contrast, you can have free-standing functions.</p>

<p>If we call a renderer a rendering, then using this rule, we&#39;d call a painter a painting. A painter <em>produces</em> a painting. A painter is not a painting. Not the same thing, and likely to cause confusion in the code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Exactly what problems will I avoid when using C# as opposed to Java? Is there no downside to using Xamarin instead of Java? Will it be easy to make the iOS version once the Android version is done? Are there problems with using certain API&#39;s or libraries? Thanks for the reply!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Very true.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Console or WPF. Console for it&#39;s simplicity, but of course for note taking you may prefer a GUI for that. With WPF you learn a lot about data binding, XAML, MVVM. These three are built into .NET/WPF and allow you to completely separate the business logic from the presentation code which is what you want :) Windows Forms is <em>ok</em> but much harder to get separated business and presentation code. Plus, WinForms does not have XAML. Creating GUI&#39;s through declarative systems such as XAML is sooooo much better than the way you do it in WinForms. You can have the graphics artists and stuff working on the GUI without needing barely any knowledge of how the developers code will utilise it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It depends on what icons you need. I like using fonts as they are scalable, can easily alter color, opacity and layer them to create new icons. Have a look at the following to see if they can help.<br/>

Of course, nothing stops you writing the code in VS and pressing compile in Xamarin IDE.</p>

Have you considered using the modular operator?(%)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Exactly.</p>

<p>Mod is the remainder of a division. </p>

<p>The easiest way to determine if a number is even or odd is to check the remainder of a division by 2. If the remainder == 0, the number is even, if it == 1, the number is odd.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks! One question, I take it the mod (%) command is read as follows: &quot;When a generated number, if divided by two, will have a remainder of one&quot;?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I use them to look up details so I&#39;m sure I&#39;m using it right, or if I need something really social. But most code speaks for itself. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>(If you&#39;re making software your business relies on, UX and QA really, really shouldn&#39;t be optional. Also, remember long term support and maintenance.)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Run 3 checks on each number generated and store 3 values (aside from the temporary value of the random number). Set your min value equal to the minimum of he min value and the random number, set max value to max of Mac and random value, increment the odd counter if the random value was odd.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>All you need is some extra variables.</p>

<ul>
<li>a <code>min</code> variable that is initially set to a number higher than the max of your random numbers</li>
<li>a <code>max</code> variable that is initially set to a number lower than the min of your random numbers</li>
<li>a counter initialized to 0 that counts every <em>odd</em> number</li>
</ul>

<p>Inside the loop, you need three checks:</p>

<ul>
<li>generated number &lt; min -&gt; set min to generated number</li>
<li>generated number &gt; max -&gt; set max to generated number</li>
<li>generated number is odd (mod 2 == 1) -&gt; increment counter for odd numbers</li>
</ul>

</div><div class="md"><p>No problem, I wrote out the solution to your homework problem to make sure I wasn&#39;t feeding you bad information.  It might seem limiting, but not using an array actually made it easier once I thought about the problem.  If you&#39;re getting stuck, try making each result 1-6 it&#39;s own int, and just updating a count for each int instead of thinking of each result as it&#39;s own.  So if a result comes up to number++ and figure out the math logic in a later function.</p>

<p>It&#39;s tough to separate what you know what will happen to what you can expect a program to understand.  So it just needs to know how many times that RNG number came up and cares little about anything else.  once you get the input parsing down, just make instanced variables for each result because it&#39;s only 6, so var1, var2 etc.  Message me back if you find problems, I remember very well what it&#39;s like to be in CIS 200 and the concepts seem out of reach but we&#39;ll make a programmer out of you yet.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>the thing is the whole thing is under the act() module which is a loop. so i cant do single actions.

I guess what im asking is how can i make her to a line of code once whilst being inside a loop module</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As long as you do the check for the leaf on the right before you place it down then there shouldn&#39;t be a problem even if the loop puts a leaf down on the right every time you move.

</div><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t feel bad about that, it is kinda normal.
I am not in the UK but Germany and when I had my degree I felt like I didn&#39;t learn anything useful from university.
I have been told that the degree only shows that you are able to teach yourself new things and you are willing to put time and effort into the topics.
I was lucky and got my current job (PHP developer) from an internship I did during my time at the university but my roommate wasn&#39;t that lucky.
His programming skills were really cute after 5 years of university, we had 2 semesters Java, 1 semester Lisp and a project where they expected us to know python. How to be able to actual program with that skill set if you don&#39;t spend your limited free time on programming? He was unemployed for a while and bought big ass java development books, went through online tutorials all day and now works as an android developer.
I really don&#39;t know what they thought designing the bachelor computer science, so much theoretical knowledge and actually no real application. In my database class we didn&#39;t look once at a real database, drawing diagrams on paper and discussing about relations... I rebuild all the exercises in MySQL, but as far as I know no one else in my class did that.
 if I had known this, I most likely wouldn&#39;t have chosen computer science (on girls day in school they showed us how awesome programming is for girls and what awesome stuff you develope in university... Danny liars :( (girls day - day where girls are introduced to male dominated work fields...))</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Nope .. As said in the description I just saw this <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2y4zxq/failed_tech_interview_can_you_review_my_code_and/">post</a> and thought I&#39;d give it a shot ..</p>

<p>But yes, Correlated arrays are not good..</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ok.  That corroborates my initial impression, then.  Is it fair to say functors have been more-or-less superseded by these (more modern) features?</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Why is every comment in this thread getting downvoted (yours and mine)?  Y&#39;all crazy.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would disagree, as long as you&#39;re not an asshole about it.</p>

<p>Where HTML is concerned, compilation really doesn&#39;t make sense. You simply don&#39;t compile HTML. Asking for an HTML compiler seems to be indicative of a fundamental misunderstanding of what HTML is and what uses it.</p>

<p>Being told that your question doesn&#39;t make sense makes it clear that you have a fundamental misunderstanding and that you may be barking up the wrong tree.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it could be indicative of not understanding terminology correctly, which is important to master, because effective communication is important and requires an understanding of terminology.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Why have &quot;functors,&quot; then?</p>

<p>In many cases, modern C++ doesn&#39;t really need them. There is of course a huge amount of existing code that uses them.</p>

<p>You should be able to set the keyboard somewhere (I haven&#39;t used a Mac for a while, though, so don&#39;t know where). For example, <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/258824">here&#39;s how to change the layout on Windows</a>.</p>

<p>Granted, I&#39;m not sure why things like symbols would be different. Seems to imply that you&#39;re using different keyboard layouts. I was under the impression that stuff like symbols are consistent across OSes and depend entirely on a standardized keyboard layout. Eg, the standard US QWERTY keyboard <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3a/Qwerty.svg">looks like this</a>.</p>

<p>Even though this is not directly code-related, I think this is a major mistake, too.</p>

<p>You are given an abstract problem here, that seeks to test your ability to solve problems.</p>

<p>&quot;Durr hurr, those coins aren&#39;t realz!&quot; is not a good reaction here at all. It is not about coins. It is not about what eggs and milk really cost, either.</p>

<p>And yet, not only did you ponder the issue, you also thought it relevant enough to include it here. If anything, it should have made you think about what other fictional coins someone might want in the next version. (See discussions about greedy algorithms here.)</p>

<p>Unlike others, I do think you were right to go overboard with input and output functions. (Not commenting on the quality of these, though.) you were asked to write an app, and that assumes a piece of usable standalone software. The focus should have been on the change making, of course. (I would have just outright rejected insufficient payments rather than allow the user to piece their payment together.)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s very easy to forget something we otherwise wouldn&#39;t think twice about doing during a technical interview, due to the added pressure and time limit.</p>

<pre><code>var modifiedFile = File.ReadAllLines(&quot;path&quot;).Select(line =&gt; line.Split(&#39;\t&#39;).ToList().Insert(index, newTag));
File.WriteAllLines(modifiedFile.Select(data =&gt; String.Join(&quot;\t&quot;, data)));

</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks. You just made me realize that the issue I&#39;m having may be due to the fact that I use Danish keyboards.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll try and describe what I mean:</p>

<ul>
<li>On Mac all open/close parenthesis/square brackets/curly braces are on the 8 and 9 keys. On Windows it&#39;s almost the same, except curly braces are on 7 and 0.</li>
<li>The keys for the @ symbol are on completely opposite sides of the keyboard.</li>
<li>The $ signs are in different places.</li>
<li>The | signs are in different places.</li>
<li>Backslashes require radically different key combos.</li>
</ul>

<p>EDIT: Just to make it clear, I&#39;m not saying that these differences are insurmountable. But they do trip me up and slow me down for a few minutes after each switch.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>yes, i&#39;ll give a list of what we think is necessary:</p>

<li><p>snmp</p></li>
<li><p>tcp</p></li>
<li><p>ip</p></li>
<li><p>Telnet (for the sending of commands) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>these are all available to use under the form of .c files </p>

<p>what these things do we understand, but the problem is when we include these in our program we still can&#39;t get someone to connect to our device</p>

<p>also we have a lot of functions/protocols of which we think we understand what they do, but can&#39;t really make out if we need them, a couple of examples: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>DynDNS vs DNS, we don&#39;t really get the difference nor do we know if we need this to run a webpage or that the internet provider takes care of distributing IP adresses</p></li>
<li><p>DHCP </p></li>
<li><p>ARP, again do we need to be able to resolve adresses on our side? </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Of many things we don&#39;t know wether we need to use them ourselves or if it will be taken care of client side, or by the network itself.</p>

<p>Our real problem is that we need to figure this all out by ourselves we can&#39;t ask our professor for help (it is part of the assignment)</p>

<p>Also we have not had any classes about networking or internet or anything related to that (or actually any computer related courses before this semester)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Functors are a C++-ism.  You should call them &quot;function objects&quot; or &quot;method objects.&quot;  In every other context, functor means something else.</p>

<p>Anyhow: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29#State_representation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29#State_representation</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>A closure can be used to associate a function with a set of &quot;private&quot; variables, which persist over several invocations of the function. The scope of the variable encompasses only the closed-over function, so it cannot be accessed from other program code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can read the Wikipedia pages yourself if you don&#39;t understand the differences between a function object, lambda abstraction, and a closure.  Closures carry with them the state where they were defined.  C++ doesn&#39;t have lexical scoping like this, so what I&#39;m saying might not make sense to you.</p>

<p>Look into how JavaScript achieves information hiding (e.g., private methods) if you want to see a C-like language that emphasizes closures to do object-oriented things.</p>

<p>What was your first original Project you came up with yourself, How did it go? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Depends on where I want to draw the line. Around age 16, I created what was essentially a CMS with PHP (and HTML, CSS, JS, and SQL). I made it because I was creating a website that was somewhat of a guide for a game I enjoyed. It started out as a static site and went through several revisions over a long period of time (I never initially intended to become a programmer, so starting out was slow).</p>

<p>It wasn&#39;t well made and got spammed to death. But it was a project and it worked. It served some useful purpose and I learned a lot about how to handle web development.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t have any major projects for a while after that, until I created what&#39;s essentially an offline Dropbox for a university class. It monitored a folder and could back it up to a particular location. It stored diffs in a database and had a GUI for recovering files and viewing history. It was also my first group project, working with 4 others. It went well, but I had to pick up a lot of extra work due to incompetent group members (I have no idea how some of these people make it so far in the CS program).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What is important to learn to do these?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For early projects, don&#39;t spend too much time planning. Learning how to effectively plan software projects is something that is best learned through experience, anyway. So dive in and learn from mistakes.</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming that these early projects are not a big deal. Stuff you&#39;re not depending on for an income. If so, take risks. Try different libraries, frameworks, and languages. If something turns out to be a bad choice, you&#39;ll at least learn from it. I learn a great deal from mistakes. In fact, I find that I often can&#39;t even figure out the best way to do something until I first do it wrong.</p>

<p>Group projects are a real hit-or-miss. You might end up working with someone who you can learn a lot from and can provide you useful experience. Or you might end up having to hand-hold someone who&#39;s completely incompetent.</p>

<p>Google a lot. Even if you have a good idea of how to do something, google it anyway. There&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ll be able to find discussion or questions related to what you&#39;re trying to do and this may yield alternative approaches or make clear some possible issues that you hadn&#39;t considered. Learn to identify the general idea behind what you&#39;re doing. That is, you&#39;ll often have some very specific problem you&#39;re trying to solve. You often can&#39;t easily google that. So either break it up into smaller, more general purpose ideas or abstract on the overarching idea.</p>

<p>Reinventing the wheel can be useful for learning, but most of the time, it&#39;s not worth it because you&#39;ll waste too much time that could have been better spent working on new things. Not to say that it&#39;s not worth reinventing the wheel for the learning purpose, but some people I&#39;ve seen go way too far here, recreating even basic data structures for every project you have. Unless you&#39;re in a first year CS class and just getting started, you should never have to reinvent the simple list, for example. In fact, I&#39;d argue that by the time you&#39;re ready to undertake a major project, you should have a solid foundation on how such data structures work and have no need to reinvent them.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I put a big &#39;ole question in headers, so answer away.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t say they were, only that they seem like a C++-style way of achieving the same thing.  In fact, from the Wikipedia page:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Lisp family languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, and others, functions are objects, just like strings, vectors, lists, and numbers. A closure-constructing operator creates a function object from a part of the program: the part of code given as an argument to the operator is part of the function, and so is the lexical environment: the bindings of the lexically visible variables are captured and stored in the function object, which is more commonly called a closure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, yep, seems pretty much like functors are a poor man&#39;s lexical closure.  Again, from Wikipedia:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many uses of functors in languages like C++ are simply emulations of the missing closure constructor. Since the programmer cannot directly construct a closure, they must define a class that has all of the necessary state variables, and also a member function. Then, construct an instance of that class instead, ensuring that all the member variables are initialized through its constructor. The values are derived precisely from those local variables that ought to be captured directly by a closure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Closures are only immutable if the values and names they&#39;ve pulled into their scope are also immutable, otherwise the internal state of the closure can change after it&#39;s been defined (the definition of mutable).  Object-oriented languages loooooove mutability, so very few (if any) make this guarantee.</p>

<p>The &quot;counter&quot; example on the Wikipedia page is an example of an <em>intentionally</em> mutable functor, for example.</p>

<p>Most schools want you to learn Python (intro language) and then either Java or C++/C. So, take a course in Python and then in Java/C++/C to get a grasp of the basics. Or just Java. Or just Python. Or anything, really. Then start building stuff and solving problems. I don&#39;t see how this is any different from any other post asking &#39;where do I begin?&#39; except that you claim to be someone who is motivated and able to teach yourself anything, yet you are doing neither. </p>

<p>I thought the MIT course was a great review for me, someone who has coded professionally but doesn&#39;t have a background in CS. The Rice courses on Coursera are happening right now, and you can literally just follow <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specialization/fundamentalscomputing2/37?utm_medium=courseDescripTop">a fairly well-developed sequence</a>.</p>

<p>Also, check out gamedev and read through their Getting Started FAQ. You&#39;re a beginner. You aren&#39;t expected - nor are you encouraged - to start building amazing programs that wow the world. That isn&#39;t where you start. Start small. Make some text-based games. Build pong. Then tetris. Then etc etc etc until you get somewhere.</p>

<p>BN: make sure to check out the universities you plan on attending. I&#39;m not sure where you are, but in CA we have assist.org that will show you the required classes to transfer in. Most schools require particular languages and coursework before accepting you to a compacted major like CS.</p>

<p>Absolutely relevant. It&#39;s not so much about what you know as much as it&#39;s about understanding exactly what you need and how/where to look it up.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I suggest the O&#39;Reilly C++ book and for game Dev work, Beginning C++ Through Game Programming (3rd ed.)

</div><div class="md"><p>When you say &quot;spent coding&quot;, what do you mean? Is keystroke frequency what matters to you? Because to me, coding is more about thinking than actually typing. There are long pauses where my computer receives no input at all.</p>

<p>What I&#39;m trying to get at is this: &quot;Time spent coding&quot; is a useless concept, unless you absolutely need an objective metric. It says nothing about you or your code. To me it&#39;s a bit like saying &quot;more lines == better program&quot;.</p>

I&#39;m guessing this because you say you&#39;re not familiar with functional programming and I can&#39;t find any other reference to the word.</p>

<p>Assuming you do, C++-style functors aren&#39;t (inherently) immutable.  An object/value/reference/whatever is immutable if it is impossible to change its state after creation.  The closest you get to guaranteed immutability in C-style languages are things declared with the <code>const</code> keyword.</p>

<p>I actually had to look up the details of C++-style functors, but they seem like a going-around-your-ass-to-get-to-your-elbow way of implementing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29">lexical closures</a>.</p>

<p>Not sure if that answers your questions.  If not, can you explain a bit more what you mean?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Ahhh. I usually just use end=&#39; &#39;. I guess that works as well haha.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh wait, you are using python 2, aren&#39;t you. I guess your equivalent to do:</p>

<pre><code>print &quot;foo&quot;,
print &quot;bar&quot;

<p>I think the secret to being a good programmer is knowing good programming practices, patterns and concepts. Then it&#39;s just a matter of how to create and recognize those patterns and apply those concepts in whatever language you&#39;re using. That&#39;s just my 2 cents tho</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>adapter, mediator, interpreter, broker, data mapper, iterator, decorator, observer, visitor, and builder are all patterns that anyone who has read the Gang of Four design patterns book would recognize - successful organizations have been using these patterns - and naming their classes after them - for decades; so clearly this rule is false.</p>

<p>that being said, all of these words indicate either what a class is, or what it does - BlahManager is a classic example of a name that communicates neither.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah don&#39;t get me wrong, I know exactly what I&#39;m getting into with game design, that&#39;s why I was so pessimistic about it in my above post. While it&#39;s something I would love to get into, it&#39;s a job market that has no need for me.</p>

<p>C++ is a language that I&#39;ve been meaning to familiarize myself with for a long time, so I suppose I will check that out. </p>

<p>I entirely agree with you that the computer science program at my school is less than ideal, but honestly, the knowledge is secondary for me. I&#39;m a highly self-motivated person and I can teach myself just about anything, given that I have sufficient resources to learn from. I&#39;m really just looking for a degree to prove on a resume that I have the practical skills required for a job.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>First of all, remove <strong>using namespace std;</strong> from your code. It doesn&#39;t help when you want to use more than 1 type of string in your code (hint: Unicode and its UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32 implementations), want to name a variable &quot;BLAH_string&quot;, or want to not have headaches when you start integrating similar objects with similar names for the sake of cross-library integration, so I&#39;d suggest you just don&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>Anyways...
<strong>Let&#39;s do this.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>name[20] is no good. Stop doing the array thing.</strong> That&#39;s a C-string thing. C+&#39;s <em>std::string</em> is a C-string super wrapper. You&#39;re basically making an array of an objects that wrap around C-strings. <strong>You&#39;re trying to assign arrays of string objects to a single string. Don&#39;t do this.</strong></li>
<li><strong>std::cin.get(std::string) is not a valid function.</strong> Use std::getline(std::cin, STRING_NAME) to get input for a string.</li>

</div><div class="md"><p>I am in two minds atm.</p>

<p>Would it be beneficial for me to pick up c# and learn that as well as improving in general since I&#39;m not getting anywhere in terms of just junior java positions? Or should I just become really proficient in one language?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p><em>Computer Science major cannot do any complex coding language</em></p>

<p><strong>That&#39;s a paradox that should not be occurring at a four-year university. I&#39;d figure that some universities might teach Java or Python or Javascript, but Visual Basic, SQL, and CSS are sort of unacceptable for university-level CS, to me, a Computer Engineering major, at least.</strong></p>

<p>At my school, we require C, C++ for Computer Engineering, and our Information and Computer Sciences major (ICS) requires Java, something with AJAX, C++, etc. I don&#39;t know much about our ICS department, but they are still on the Java bandwagon, it seems.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s my pitch:</strong> <a href="http://www.learncpp.com/">C++</a></p>

<p>I would tell you to learn Javascript or Python. But C++ is basically a &quot;core language&quot; that, if mastered, can teach you a majority of computer science concepts and is infinitely helpful for understanding lower-level programming. You are somewhat primed for programming with Visual Basic, so I would suggest that you start with a lower-level programming language (but not C! Oh God, C! Don&#39;t even get me started with printf()) I would suggest that you then begin playing around with SFML or SDL, since you&#39;re inclined to video games, but here&#39;s the fact: games is over-saturated, and they WILL treat you like crap. Unless YOU make a game, you will not be happy. I had these same dreams in high school and I quickly discarded it for a Computer Engineering degree for greater mobility and value.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You are correct. It took me three hours but I found the rogue parenthesis that was messing me up</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>One way to do this is to make use of a doubly-linked linked list, and then store the digits in reverse order (first is 1s, second is 10s, third is 100s) and then add them all together using a recursive algorithm:</p>

       a.remove(FIRST_DIGIT); b.remove(FIRST_DIGIT); //Remove the first entries of each list

</div><div class="md"><p>Will only get better in time to be honest but thank you very much.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can&#39;t store 50 digits accurately in a float, anyway. Use scientific notation.</p>

<p>Eg, instead of:</p>

<pre><code>double foo = 10000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000.0;
</code></pre>

<p>(which compiles perfectly fine in G++, by the way), use:</p>

<pre><code>double foo = 1e49;
</code></pre>

<p>Way more readable in the latter form, anyway.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You mean a <em>literal</em> with 50&nbsp;digits? Obviously you have to write it as a floating-point literal, not an integer literal, if it&#39;s too big for any of the integer types. Put a decimal point at the end. Clang and GCC both compile 50-digit floating-point literals without a hitch.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>To be honest, university is just a waste of time in my opinion. Could be because I put no effort in and got a 2.1 (UK grade) and learnt bad habits or just in general was not taught anything the way the industry does things. Come to think about it, I am no where near ready to be hired as I do not know any algorithms, design patterns or object orientation. I think I went to a shit university and got robbed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That is C++, not&nbsp;C.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I assumed I did use modulus in my code but I hadn&#39;t. I guess my mathematical logic is pretty poor along with my programming.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know about you, but I get compiler errors trying to create variables with 50 digits. Kind of a showstopper.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t feel stupid.  Interviews are high pressure, shit happens.  I&#39;ve bombed interviews before.</p>

<p>I think it would have helped you a lot to spend time to think about the program.  It looks to me that you just jumped right into coding it and then went with it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I feel very stupid looking at how I handled this test. But I understand that it really can be broken down into small pieces to make it OO. The coins being stored as a double was something I was relatively new to and thus I have learned from my mistake.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This. Reading documentation when starting out is a pain in the ass because we don&#39;t know how. Not to mention the usual scroll-to-the-bottom-to-copy-paste-this-code-and-not-actually-think-what-is-doing. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I hope you are programming everyday and have personal projects. If you aren&#39;t then you have no one to blame but yourself. I try to code everyday. Compared to when I started, I know a shit ton. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For one, you can handle the app class as an object itself.</p>

<p>The only method that needs to be static in your code is the main function.  Everything else doesn&#39;t need to be.  Within the main class, you can instantiate an &quot;app&quot; object and then starting your program from there.  You can completely get rid of the need for static methods if you do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    App changeApp = new App();
    changeApp.startProgram();  //or could be in the constructor of App class
}
</code></pre>

<p>You can also split up a lot of your code into multiple classes.  You can put a lot of IO code into a separate class, and anything involving change into another separate class.  The app class would be entirely focused on things like displaying a menu, and controlling the app logic.  Finally, you can also put your constants in another class.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think you need any regular expressions for the input.  You can just use the scanner class to get the necessary input.</p>

<p>Your giveChange() method can be simplified a lot, too.</p>

<p>The algorithm to work out the correct amount of coins can be simplified:</p>

<pre><code>changeOwed = amountPaid - productPrice;
int coinCount = 0;

while(changeOwed &gt; 0)
{
    if(coinStack.peek() &gt; changeOwed)
    {
        changeOwed -= coinStack.peek();
        coinCount++;
    }
    else
        coinStack.pop();
}  

return coinCount;
</code></pre>

<p>coinStack is just a stack of the possible coins.</p>

<p>another solution:</p>

<pre><code>changeOwed = amountPaid - productPrice;
int coinCount = 0;

for(int coin : coins)
{
    if(coin &lt;= changeOwed)
    {
        coinCount += changeOwed / coin;
        changeOwed %= coin;
    }
}

return coinCount;
</code></pre>

<p>The other big issue I see with your code is the usage of doubles for representing currency.  This is a <em>huge</em> no-no.  In fact, you could easily represent all of the values as ints if you wanted to.  Just multiply everything by 100 and now you no longer need to worry about decimals.  1p is now 100, and 1/4p goes from .25 to 25.  You actually did the opposite of that by handling 1p as .01.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The learning slope is different for everybody. I&#39;m in the learning phase as well, and sometimes I spend hours on a simple thing that people do in minutes.

<p>So if there&#39;s a part of the tree that looks like this, and you are deleting node b:</p>

<pre><code>a -&gt; b -&gt; c
</code></pre>

<p>You correctly assign the appropriate child pointer of a to point to c, but you never assign the parent pointer of c to point to a. Instead, it keeps pointing to b, and thus to garbage once b gets deleted.</p>

Instead, we should try to search for the underlying principle. <em>Why</em> shouldn&#39;t we class our verbs? If we took it to the extreme, what kind of anti-pattern would emerge?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Allows you to drag &amp; drop to design responsive HTML templates - <a href="https://www.klaviyo.com">https://www.klaviyo.com</a>. Export to HTML is available</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You are told that each row and column must have all of the values from 1 to n with no repeats. So you need some way to keep track of which values you have seen, and which values you have not seen for a given row or column. </p>

<p>I would start by first writing a loop to check all of the rows, then write a loop to check all of the columns. Once you have this implemented and working, then you might try optimizing it so that you check both in one loop. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The child shouldn&#39;t be modifying the parent.  Change <code>deleteMovieNode</code> so that it returns the root node of the child tree with the given node deleted.  The parent can then say something like...</p>

<pre><code>node-&gt;leftChild = deleteMovieNode(deleteStr, node-&gt;leftChild)
</code></pre>

<p>Your method signatures are weird, IMO, but hopefully you get the idea.  This will vastly simplify your code by removing any parent-related logic — the child no longer needs to know anything about the parent in order to do its job.</p>

<p>Also, your code would be much clearer if you had a separate classes for binary search tree-related things and movie-related things.  Your movie database would combine the two.  This is what C++ templates were made for.  Your code is overly complex in part because you&#39;re intermingling movie-related things with BST-related things.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can read in the file (into memory), modify it (by adding the new column), and then write the new contents back into the file (overwriting the original contents).  This can work if the file is small enough to fit in memory.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you can stream the operation -- read in a line of input, add the new column, and then write the line to a separate file.  At the end, delete the input file and rename the output file to the original name.</p>

<p>In general, the naive optimistic approach that immediately comes to mind is to somehow &quot;insert&quot; the new contents in the middle, but this is in fact very difficult or impossible, especially given the level of abstraction C# lives at.  Like a cassette tape, you can&#39;t just insert content into the middle.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hey Ford I found this post a month or so ago really good <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2tg8hm/my_advice_to_understanding_open_source_projects/">http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/2tg8hm/my_advice_to_understanding_open_source_projects/</a> just don&#39;t forget your towel! :P</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>sorry I forgot to include Node *newNode; in the code up top. </p>

<p>Also, what should I be pointing to the new node? Should I be creating another node that acts as the head ptr?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ok, that makes more sense. Problem is I can&#39;t seem to find the right order in which to check through the rows and columns. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What happens if the node you&#39;re trying to delete is the root? In that case, x-&gt;parent == NULL and x-&gt;parent-&gt;whatever is undefined behavior. Can you run your test session under Valgrind and post the output?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>IMO, whether he should use constants or not misses the forest for the trees.  The interviewer was almost certainly expecting some core logic along these lines (in Ruby):</p>

<pre><code>def give_change(amount, denominations)
  change = []

  denominations.sort.reverse.each do |denom|
    coins  = amount / denom
    amount = amount % denom

    change.push(coins)
  end

  change
end

# 7 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel, 1 penny
p give_change(184, [25, 10, 5, 1]) == [7, 0, 1, 4]

# 2 quarters, 2 dimes, 0 nickels, 4 pennies
p give_change(74, [25, 10, 5, 1]) == [2, 2, 0, 4]
</code></pre>

<p>Modulo the object-oriented-ness, specific denominations, etc.</p>

<p>I mean, what are you supposed to do, update your big ass list of constants every time you want to support different denominations?</p>

<p>(Yes, I realize this algorithm doesn&#39;t work in general, and that the OP might need a slightly different algorithm to minimize the number of coins depending on the list of denominations.  My point is that his use or non-use of constants are the <em>least</em> of the problems with this code.)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>thanks, I&#39;m going to study this one first.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In your structure, get rid of the &quot;name[20]&quot; and replace with just &quot;name&quot;. You&#39;ve declared it as a string, not an array of characters. Instead of:</p>

<pre><code>name[20] = {&quot;Superprogrammer&quot;} 
</code></pre>

<p>just do:</p>

<pre><code>name = &quot;Superprogrammer&quot;;

<p>Other than that the struct is fine.</p>

<p>When you&#39;re trying to read in a string, with cin you can just do:</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, I modified my code. I&#39;m getting an error on the line where I receive input from the user to be placed in TESCStudent.name. </p>

<p>new code: <a href="http://ideone.com/FmrhmV">http://ideone.com/FmrhmV</a></p>

<p>Is there anything obviously wrong with my code that would prevent the program from doing what I intend it to do?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Try doing a small example with pen and paper, following your algorithm exactly.</p>

<p>If you need a hint:
As you are doing the above, think about the list preceding the new node.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m rather curious as to how this code even compiles, considering that <code>newNode</code> is not declared. Surely it&#39;s not global?</p>

<p>You really need to rename the function. It&#39;s not clear from the name that you&#39;re trying to insert a value into a list while maintaining sorting (or at least you should have mentioned that in your post, since this isn&#39;t typical linked list behavior).</p>

<p>Note that you&#39;re &quot;inserting&quot; a node that points to the next node (if there is one) but nothing points to the node you just &quot;inserted&quot;! That&#39;s presumably not intended?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t quite understand your description, but if you just want numbers up to some value (e.g. 1 through 100,000) that don&#39;t contain digits above a certain amount, you could just iterate from 1 to that value in the appropriate base.</p>

<p>For instance, to obtain all integers from 1 to 100,000 that don&#39;t use the digits 6, 7, 8, or 9, you can iterate from 1 to 100,000 in base 6, and use their base 6 representation as the output.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C style, by passing a pointer instead of a reference.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In addition to what <a href="/u/zifyoip">/u/zifyoip</a> said, floating point <em>might</em> work for you. Floating point numbers (types <code>float</code> and <code>double</code>) store numbers in scientific notation. As a result, they can store very large numbers. An IEEE 754 compatible double can store approximately &amp;pm;2<sup>1024</sup>.</p>

<p>But that comes at a catch: precision. A large number isn&#39;t stored exactly, but rather to an approximation. There&#39;s usually something like ~15 digits of precision for double.</p>

<p>So you could, for example, add two 50 digit numbers together and you&#39;d get a result that is approximately correct. It wouldn&#39;t be exact, but it&#39;d be close enough for the vast majority of purposes.</p>

<p>Floating point numbers are faster to work with and easier to use than the &quot;big int&quot; numbers like those in GMP, especially for C, which lacks operator overloading and thus arithmetic becomes ugly -- it&#39;s a lot harder to read:</p>

<pre><code>mpz_add(result, number1, number2);
mpz_mul_si(doubled, result, 2);
</code></pre>

<p>Than:</p>

<pre><code>doubled = (number1 + number2) * 2;
</code></pre>

<p>EDIT: Why the downvotes? I&#39;ve made it perfectly clear that floating point is an approximation and may not be suitable for OP&#39;s purpose. I brought this up because if OP only needs an approximation (which would be sufficient if you were trying to solve some physics or chemistry equation with ridiculously large constants), floating point is the way to go. It&#39;s not a replacement for arbitrary precision integers, but it&#39;s a perfectly on topic from the limited information that OP gave.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Ok. Now explain how that logically translates to you having 20 strings (or rather, an array of size 20) in <code>struct StudentRecord</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The problem is that you see the if statement as :</p>

<p>With <code>paid &gt; product</code>, you have your boolean and it turns out this is what you want to return. So what do you need the <code>if</code> for.</p>

<p>Another common one you probably do (because we all did at the beginning, I did 20 years ago):</p>

<pre><code>if (some_condition == true) {
    // do stuff

<p>Remove the <code>== true</code>, it serves no purpose. At the beginning, it feels weird to remove it. That means you don&#39;t really understand the <code>if</code> statement yet.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>When I was a freshman, I had just taken a intro to CS class, so an example of a technical question they might ask is: Given an array of Strings, return all the unique strings in it. Something simple, but still tests your problem solving and coding skills.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Some feedback on your code:</p>

<ol>
<li>By convention, Ruby code is indented two spaces every indentation level.  Not 4 spaces, not 8 spaces, not with tabs set to a width of 2 — two literal space characters.</li>
<li>By convention, class names are singular, i.e., <code>Student</code> not <code>Students</code>.  That&#39;s because an instance of the class represents <em>a</em> student.</li>
<li>The variable assignment on line 18 is pointless; you can just return <code>@name + &quot; &quot; + @last</code> directly.</li>
<li>Use string interpolation to generate strings, don&#39;t use manual concatenation with <code>+</code>, i.e., <code>&quot;#{@name} #{@last}&quot;</code> instead of <code>@name + &quot; &quot; + @last</code>.</li>
<li>Use the public-facing methods where possible instead of instance variables, i.e., <code>name + &quot; &quot; + last</code> instead of <code>@name + &quot; &quot; + @last</code></li>
<li>Avoid class variables.  They&#39;re rarely what you want and don&#39;t behave how you think they do.  If you want, create a <code>StudentList</code> class that represents a collection of students.  It can be initialized with an <code>Array</code> of <code>Student</code> objects and hold that <code>Array</code> as an instance variable internally.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once you have that list, you can calculate the average as</p>

<pre><code>class StudentList
  def average_age
    total_age = 0

    students.each do |student|
      total_age += student.age
    end

    total_age / students.length.to_f
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Or more idiomatically:</p>

<pre><code>class StudentList
  def average_age
    students.reduce { |total_age, student| total_age + student.age } / students.length.to_f
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>If all you want to do is a one-off calculation of average student age, just define an <code>average_age</code> method and call it by passing in an <code>Array</code> of <code>Student</code> objects.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>First, I probably would have written the get money from customer as a recursive function.  That is a prime example of something that works better and is clearer recursively.   Then your return from that would be your change that was due to the customer which you would pass to a recursive give change function.  </p>

<p>Second Never use floating point for money because of rounding issues.  In something like this it would never be an issue but generally you should not ever use floating point for something that requires exact accuracy.  There are other options you can use that are better for that. </p>

<p>Generally I try to always avoid global variables, also the Static final variables are kind of sloppy.  The reason is that if I am reading your code and I see you call one I have to then scroll up to the top to see what it does or is.  Its just generally frowned upon.   </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s really what the rule is about -- see <a href="http://objology.blogspot.com/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html">http://objology.blogspot.com/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html</a> </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It seems like a few people are misunderstanding the intent behind this rule, so if this is the first time you&#39;re hearing about it, I would recommend you read <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/execution-in-kingdom-of-nouns.html">Execution in the Kingdom of Nouns</a> first -- it establishes the background and a lot of the sentiment and distaste people have for functions masquerading as classes. (The problem is that classes that end in &quot;er&quot; or &quot;or&quot; are very frequently verbs in disguise, pretending to be nouns). Then, read <a href="http://objology.blogspot.com/2011/09/one-of-best-bits-of-programming-advice.html">this</a> -- it talks more specifically about this particular rule.</p>

<p>Anyways, to answer your question, if the class that you&#39;re creating is blatantly a verb or an action, then it might actually be good to just make it a standalone function and not part of a class. Then, instead of having state, you&#39;d have each method take in some data, transform it or create a new version, and return it -- you&#39;d end up chaining and piping a series of functions together, acting on the bundle of data you&#39;re passing around. Sometimes, the functional paradigm will end up being a better fit for your problem then an object-oriented one.</p>

<p>However, if you genuinely need an object, then I suppose what you need to do is try and encapsulate and design your objects in such a way that each object represents a concrete thing. However, it&#39;s a little hard to give suggestions in the abstract -- if you can provide a few examples of the classes that you&#39;ve written that you&#39;re uncomfortable with, I can try and give some suggestions on some different ways you could try organizing your code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your code currently has this general outline:</p>

<pre><code>Loop
    if everything is right return true
end Loop

something wasn&#39;t right return false
</code></pre>

<p>It would be much easier if you changed it so that your loop would check for something wrong - i.e. it finds a duplicate, so it returns false . Then if your loops run to completion, you know that your array is a Latin Square meaning that you can then return true. So:</p>

<pre><code>Loop
    Found error, return false
End Loop

nothing wrong with array, return true

It&#39;s more that it&#39;s so specialized that it&#39;s hard to find the information that you need, especially in a closed source OS such as Windows. Are you trying to capture the whole screen, or only if OpenGL is used? OpenGL is probably not the right way to go if you want the whole screen under all conditions, though I&#39;m not sure.</p>

<p>Personally, I would look more towards native interfaces for something like that. There are tools in Windows that will trace the DLL calls an application makes. You can use that to try to reverse engineer how Fraps does it. Or, you can try on Stack Overflow.

<p>That&#39;s odd. The compiler must be selectively enforcing some warnings as errors. It is suppressable with a pragma though: <code>#pragma warning(disable:4996)</code> before the include, and then <code>#pragma warning(default: 4996)</code> after the include.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The issue with global variables is that <em>anything</em> can change them -- every single method, class, and line of code is capable of interacting and modifying those globals.</p>

<p>As a result, as your code grows larger and larger, the number of potential interactions (and therefore the number of potential bugs) will grow larger and larger.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, if anybody can modify globals, they probably will, causing your code to become hopeless entangled. It <em>is</em> possible to use globals correctly and not run into this issue, but it takes a lot of discipline so it&#39;s better to avoid tempting fate and avoid globals unless there&#39;s a compelling reason to do so otherwise (for example, if you&#39;re working on a memory-constrained device and need to manage your data very carefully).</p>

<p>In contrast, if you keep all variables scoped as tightly as possible, the number of potential interactions stays much more manageable, decreasing the number of potential bugs.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I got started by making games, you could too! Pick an old arcade game with a simplistic mechanic that is challenging -- something like asteroids. Break it down: draw the space ship to the screen, then make it move when you push buttons, then add the ability to shoot, then add simple square asteroids that move and disappear when shot. Now take a step back and go in a direction that interests you.</p>

<p>Want asteroids that look unique? Try to use randomness to make them different shapes. Now your collision detection is off, so you&#39;ve got to make that better. What if they break when shot? How could this be more realistic?</p>

<p>Want sound effects? Figure out how to add them! What about music and overall atmosphere?</p>

<p>Got tired of asteroids? Pick a different type of game, maybe a platformer... Then you could make a level editor!</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The only thing that I can think of is a screen recorder.  I tried to make one using OpenGL but I hit a huge brick wall and found out that there was much more to the puzzle than I was aware of.</p>

<p>My original idea was to use the glReadPixels() function and use FreeImage to export the frame it collected.  It was an early proof of concept and I was eventually going to rework it so each frame would instead be part of an AVI file.</p>

<p>The brick wall was that there is apparently a lot more involved than just exporting the frame from the buffer.  Each frame, no matter what, would export as a 1920x1080 grey image.  I posted to two subreddits and hardly got any responses. One person responded who had no idea about OpenGl and the other told me that what I was doing wasn&#39;t going to export and image.  I apparently needed &quot;DLL injection&quot; or something.  I had read about it, but was under the impression that it was used in only certain kinds of recorders to gain bette performance a la Fraps.</p>

<p>Basically, that&#39;s where I am now.  It&#39;s a neat idea but I don&#39;t have anywhere near the skill it seems to figure it out without reading really deep into the OpenGL documentation, which is above my level of understanding.  I did a lot of Googling on capturing frames and found hardly anything.</p>

<p>But anyways, that&#39;s my answer.  I wanted a no BS, free screen recorder but apparently lack the skill to do it.  Or maybe the idea isn&#39;t popular enough so it doesn&#39;t get much attention.</p>

<p>Once all the threads are spawned, I wait for them to finish. The final operation using them all together is quite trivial, but getting there isn&#39;t, so the threads speed up that process. I still can&#39;t continue until they all finish, so I must join them with the main thread.</p>

<p>For most simple tasks, you could even use Blueprint for that which is a node-based visual scripting system and allows designers to implement gameplay features with ease. You can implement full games with Blueprint if you really wanted.</p>

<p>There&#39;s <a href="https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/GettingStarted/FromUnity/index.html">this</a> page that shows you how C# code in Unity compares to the C++ code you would find in Unreal.

<p>If the company specializes in something - such as networking - they may ask you questions related to that. </p>

<p>Knowing your Discrete Math can also be very handy, I&#39;ve had interviewers that had me do some simple problems as a warmup. </p>

<p>Another good avenue is Ratios (basically, an object that keeps both the numerator and denominator, just like you did in elementary school). It&#39;s also heavier to compute than ints or floats but as long as you don&#39;t mix them with floats, it has infinite precision.</p>

<p>You also have repeated sections of code where you try to get a number in your main, and if that fails you call through to your method to get a double. Your method should do the initial first value, and use a do-while loop. The param you pass to it is entirely not needed as well.

<p>As soon as the first for loop (with d) finds values a[b][d] and a[b][c] such that they are not equal, your function returns true. So if you had the array: </p>

[ 2 2 2 2 2 ]
[ 2 2 2 2 2 ]
[ 2 2 2 2 2 ]

</div><div class="md"><p>Which is good! It means you fixed your first bug.</p>

<p>My bet is that your conversion of the input into a number is incorrect. For example, if I enter 4000, then code == 4000. Manually evaluating your code, I got:</p>

<p>static_cast&lt;double&gt;(code)/10 - code/10* 10;
static_cast&lt;double&gt;(4000)/10 - 4000/10<em>10;
4000/10 - 4000/10</em>10;
400 - 400*10;
400 - 4000;
-3600</p>

<p>Do you want the first digit? If so, then perhaps the following approach would work:</p>

<p>if (code &lt; 10)
  digit = code;
else if (code &lt; 100)
  digit = code / 10;
else if (code &lt; 1000)
  digit = code / 100;
else if (code &lt; 10000)
  digit = code / 1000;
else {
  cout &lt;&lt; &quot;I only want a 4-digit number!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
  continue; // or something else to reset
  }</p>

<p>There are a couple other solutions (e.g. converting to a string and getting the character, or using logarithms). It depends largely on what makes the most sense to you.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Your code is very confusing. For example why are you adding nodes inside a search function?</p>

<p>If I was doing this I would break the process into three distinct steps as follows.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Build the tree in memory</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Walk the tree an print the values to check step 1</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Create the required search function by using the walk code from step 2 and add a simple comparison check.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>On line&nbsp;2 of the pseudocode, W&nbsp;is initialized to&nbsp;{F}. So initially W contains a single element,&nbsp;F. The pseudocode is working with the DFA given by M&nbsp;=&nbsp;(Q,&nbsp;Σ,&nbsp;δ,&nbsp;q₀,&nbsp;F), so here F represents the set of accept states.</p>

<p>What question did I ignore?</p>

<p>The only question I actually asked.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s a bad idea to show off your programming skills by jamming shit into your code. Always make your code as simple as possible.  If a regex is the simplest way to do something, then use it. Otherwise do the simpler way.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>At this point, how do you make Y. Do you take the powerset of P and go from there or what?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, Y is an element of&nbsp;P. Like&nbsp;W, P&nbsp;is a set of sets; each element of&nbsp;P is a set of states. So &quot;for each set&nbsp;Y in&nbsp;P&quot; means to iterate through the elements of&nbsp;P; each single element of&nbsp;P is a set of states.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Is W the power set of all non accept states?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For this you would need the lowest denomination to be a quarter of a pence (qp), so 1p would be 4qp and £1 would be 400qp</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>From there I get a little confused. &quot;Choose and remove a set A from W&quot;. Can A have more than one member, and how do you go about selected A?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>W&nbsp;is a set of sets. Each single element of&nbsp;W is a set of states. So &quot;choose and remove a set&nbsp;A from&nbsp;W&quot; means to select and remove a single element of&nbsp;W; that single element of&nbsp;W is a set of states.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Strictly speaking, the <code>*</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>&amp;</code> symbols in a declaration are part of the <em>declarator</em>, not the type.</p>

<p>This distinction usually isn&#39;t important, but it becomes important if you say something like this:</p>

<pre><code>int *p, q;
</code></pre>

<p>This declares a pointer-to-<code>int</code> called&nbsp;<code>p</code> and an <code>int</code> (not a pointer-to-<code>int</code>) called&nbsp;<code>q</code>. The reason is that the <code>*</code>&nbsp;symbol is part of the declarator&nbsp;<code>*p</code>—it isn&#39;t part of the type.</p>

int &amp;foo = ...;     // this &amp; is NOT the address-of operator; it is part of the type (int &amp;)

</div><div class="md"><p>Yep, pretty handy for rushing through the early game. You&#39;re welcome.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you for your explanation, that makes a lot more sense! Would the best way to do this is to assign all the variables in new_node separately?</p>

<pre><code>Node *new_node = malloc(sizeof(TreeNode)); 
new_node -&gt; value = node -&gt; value;
new_node -&gt; left = node -&gt; left;
new_node -&gt; right = node -&gt; right;

<p>I also realized that when I add more than one value to my tree I get a runtime error, and the base node is returned. <a href="http://ideone.com/0kSEuB">http://ideone.com/0kSEuB</a> Is this a problem with not freeing the allocated memory?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think in this case we&#39;re actually talking about constants, not global variables.</p>

<p>Global variables are a nightmare because if you change the value in one bit of code, it&#39;s changed for everything.  And we&#39;re not talking in source, we&#39;re talking at runtime.  If method foo() changes your variable, then it&#39;s going to be changed for method bar() which may not be expecting that.  </p>

<p>Constants can be a good thing, as it gives you a single place to set values.  The concern here is that the name of the constant is so tied to the value of the constant, it might as well be a magic number.  I don&#39;t necessarily agree with that, as the constant makes it obvious everywhere in code that it&#39;s referring to the same thing, while just using &quot;0.75&quot; means that if you change it, you need to make sure every instance is <em>that</em> 0.75, and not some other unrelated 0.75.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The thing is, this work wouldn&#39;t be about building skills. . . for 2 people it would be a full time job for several months if not more than a year just to develop.</p>
