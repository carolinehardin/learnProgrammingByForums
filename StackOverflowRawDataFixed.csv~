"28347780","<p>Sci kit learn has an implementation of the Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator ( <strong>model = sklearn.covariance.MinCovDet()</strong> ).</p>

<p>As you fit the data ( <strong>model.fit(X)</strong> ) two different covariances are estimated, which are stored as attributes:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The first is <strong>model.raw_covariance_</strong> described in the documentation as ""The raw robust estimated covariance before correction and re-weighting "".</p></li>
<li><p>The second is <strong>model.covariance_</strong> described as ""Estimated robust covariance matrix"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>There are two methods that seem to compute two more different covariances:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>model.correct_covariance(X)</strong> is said to ""Apply a correction to raw Minimum Covariance Determinant estimates.""</p></li>
<li><p><strong>model.reweight_covariance(x)</strong> is said to ""Re-weight observations using Rousseeuw’s method (equivalent to deleting outlying observations from the data set before computing location and covariance estimates).""</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Can anyone explain the difference between all these?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

"28353187","<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>I've used Castle Windsor with Installers and Facilities according to the Castle Windsor tutorial with earlier versions of MVC (pre-6) and WebAPI. </p>

<p>ASP.NET 5 has included some Dependency Injection support but I still haven't figured out exactly how to wire it up, and the few samples I have found look a lot different than how I've used it before (with the installers/facilities). Most examples predate ASP.NET 5's recent release and some seem to have outdated information.</p>

<p>It seems to have changed quite radically from the previous versions composition root setup, and not even Microsoft.Framework.DependencyInjection.ServiceProvider can resolve all of the dependencies when I set it as the Castle Windsor DI fallback. I'm still digging into the details but there isn't much up to date information.</p>

<h2>My attempt to use Castle Windsor for DI</h2>

        {
            // ADDED app.ApplicationServices FOR FALLBACK DI

I would like to use the ready-made components of WordPress combined with my programming skills to create things a bit faster. 
There are plenty of resources and tutorials online of course. Literally hundreds of courses in Lynda.com for Wordpress only. 
I know there are some core concepts I need to understand. Obviously all the courses would be repeating themselves to some extent. I am looking for the best way to get the core of it.</p>

<p>Like, how to program FOR Wordpress? Me, I am almost never happy with what's already made, and many times would like to make modifications.
Do I need to learn how to develop plugins? can I simply modify existing plugins? For example if I want to use my own tables in the DB, are there any methods/plugins that make it more straightforward instead of writing my own code?

Other then a basic programming fundamentals Course that I took last year which we jumped right into visual basic(Which I understood the concepts like loops and arrays) But really struggled with the syntax as I had no previous programming skills coming into it. The way my community college operates is they like to cram as much advanced level concepts in the shortest frame possible(as this class only meets every other Saturday). They cram 3 hours worth of material and once I get lost I feel like a fish in water. I also understand that Rome was not built in 1 day and I need patients for concepts to click. I am good enough in html and css(with an ok understanding in javascipt) But really struggle understanding VB and have absolutely no knowledge in C#(which are definitely new skill sets I would love to put the effort to add to my repertoire).  My main professional goal is to land an intership in front end development(css, javascript, Html, Wordpress, PHP) where they are willing to teach me as I go. The school has no resources to get any kind of tutoring help so I have made an effort to hire a paid tutor(which I am starting on Sunday).  I am the kind of learner That I need things explained multiple times(and very slowly) but when it clicks it clicks.  The main question is does any experienced developers have any advice on the most efficient direction I should move.  Getting though the course is one priority but I also feel like I want to slow down a little bit(and really understand the concepts).  Would it be time efficient to really start cramming in hours and hours into both VB and C#(and just the .net framework so that asp.net starts to make a little more sense to me.)  I also understand that I am not going understand things till I start applying my knowledge and have people teaching me in the real world.

I'd like to do ""feature selection"" on my events to pick a subset of them which makes the distribution of <code>my_data['success']</code> as close to normal as possible in the sense of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_of_random_variables#Convergence_in_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">""convergence in distribution""</a>. </p>

<p>I looked at the <code>scikit-learn</code> ""feature selection"" methods <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and the ""Univariate feature selection"" seems like it makes sense. But I'm very new to both <code>pandas</code> and <code>scikit-learn</code> and could really use help on how to actually implement this in code. </p>

<p><b>Constraints:</b> I need to keep <i>at least</i> half the original events.</p>

<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated. Please share as many details as you can, I am very new to these libraries and would love to see how to do this with my DataFrame.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><b>EDIT</b>: After looking some more at the <code>scikit-learn</code> feature selection approaches, ""Recursive feature selection"" seems like it might make sense here too but I'm not sure how to build it up with my ""accuracy"" metric being ""close to normally distributed with mean...""</p>

"29179909","<p>I've been learning Python recently. As it's a relative joy to use, I've decided to start with that. I've done coding in college. Even though it was a decade ago, I still have knowledge of functions, flow control, scope, OOP, etc. (in languages such as Perl, Java, C, and C++) such that that should give me a jump start, even though I'll likely have to look up a bunch of stuff when hurdles present themselves. I was thinking about implementing a board game without AI (with a solitaire mode, or played exclusively that way).</p>

<p>Would it be a ""waste of time"" so to speak if my first program were completely text based? The advantage here is I can get down to coding right away. Is it worth going through this experience? OTOH, I'll want to learn to do GUIs at some point, as it makes it much more appealing and more true to the real deal.</p>

<p>I'll add to the list below as people reply, I apologise if I duplicate any entries.</p>

<p><strong>Pros I have so far</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Minimal money requirement (they already have a computer)</li>
<li>Will help them to think in new ways</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Great challenge, every day really is a fresh challenge in some way, shape or form. Not many jobs can truly offer that.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) I like the way it makes me think.. I look at EVERYTHING more logically as my skills improve.. This helps with general living as well as programming.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Money is/can be pretty good.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Its a pretty portable trade.. With collaboration tech as it is, you can pretty much work anywhere in the world so long as you have an Internet connection.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) It's an exciting industry to work in, theres massive amounts of tech to work and play with!</li>
<li>(Quarrelsome) Jetpacks. Programming is Technology and the more time we spend with technology the closer we get to having Jetpacks. (<em>Teifion: This is a really cool analogy!</em>)</li>
<li>(Saj) Profitable way of Exercising Brain Muscles.</li>
<li>(Saj) It makes you look brilliant to some audience.</li>
<li>(Saj) Makes you tech-smart.</li>
<li>(Saj) Makes you eligible to the future world.</li>
<li>(Saj) It's easy, fun, not in a math way..</li>
<li>(kiwiBastard) If the person likes problem solving then programming is no better example.</li>
<li>(kiwiBastard) Brilliant sense of achivement when you can interact with something you have designed and coded</li>
<li>(kiwiBastard) Great way to meet chicks/chaps - erm, maybe not that one (<em>Teifion: I dunno where you do programming but I want to come visit some time</em>)</li>
<li>(epatel) Learning how to program is like learning spell casting at Hogwarts . The computer will be your servant forever...</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Cons I have so far</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Can be frustrating when it's not working</li>
<li>Not physical exercise</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) There are a lot of people doing it just for the money. They have no love for the craft and just appear lazy, annoying and sometimes it can really grind my gears seeing an industry and workforce I enjoy so much being diluted with crap. Which can often reflect badly on all of us.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Not so sure about the initial cost.. Yeah you can get started with Java or something at low cost, but for me, locally, the vast demand is for .NET developers, which can be costly getting up and running with. However, this is rapidly/has not becoming the case with the amount of work put in by MS with releasing pretty damn good Express editions of their main development product line.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Its a lifelong career.. I truly feel you never really become a ""master"" by nature of the industry, you stop for 1-2 years. You're behind the times.. Some people do not like the pace.</li>
<li>(Rob Cooper) Some geeks can be hard to work with.. While I think the general geek movement is really changing for the better, you will always have the classic ""I am more intelligent than you"" geeks that can really just be a pain in the ass for all!</li>
<li>(Saj) Can cause virtual damage.</li>
<li>(Saj) Can make one throw their computer away.</li>
<li>(Saj) Can make one only virtually available to the world.</li>

"14837","<p>I'm really interested in speech-to-text algorithms, but I'm not sure where to start studying up on them. A bunch of searching around led me to <a href=""http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/HLTsurvey/download.html"">this</a>, but it's from 1996 and I'm fairly certain that there have been improvements since then.</p>

<p>Does anyone who has any experience with this sort of stuff have any recommendations for reading / source code to examine? Or just general advice on what I should be trying to learn about if I want to get into the world of writing speech recognition programs (sometimes it's hard to know what to search for if you don't have much knowledge about the domain).</p>

<p>Edit: I'd like to do something cross-platform, but for the moment I'd be targeting linux. </p>

<p>Edit 2: Thanks csmba for the well-thought out reply. At this point in time, I'm mainly interested in being able to create applications that allow automation, or execution of different commands through voice. So, a limited amount of recognizable commands being able to be strung together. An example would be a music player that took commands like ""Play the album Hello Everything by Squarepusher"", or an application launcher that allowed the user to create voice-shortcuts to launch specific apps.</p>

<p>I realize that it's a pretty giant problem, and that I have nowhere near the level of knowledge required right now to tackle implementing an entire recognition engine, although the techniques involved with doing so fascinate me, and it is something I'd like to work myself up to doing. In all likelihood, I'll probably end up picking up a book or two on the subject and studying up / playing with ""simple"" implementations in my free time.</p>

"24004","<p>Modern Databases systems today come with loads of feature. And you would agree with me that to learn one database you must unlearn the concepts you learned in another database. For e.g. each database would implement locking differently than other. So to carry the concepts of one database to another would be a recipe for failure. And there could be other examples where two database would perform very very differently. </p>

<p>So while developing the database driven systems should the programmers need to know the database in detail so that they code for performance? I don't think it would be appropriate to have the DBA called for performance later as his job is to only maintain the database and help out the developer in case of emergency but not on a regular basis. </p>

"27242","<p>I've had a lot of good experiences learning about web development on <a href=""http://www.w3schools.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">w3schools.com</a>. It's hit or miss, I know, but the PHP and CSS sections specifically have proven very useful for reference.</p>

<p>Anyway, I was wondering if there was a similar site for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a>. I'm interested in learning, but I need it to be online/searchable, so I can refer back to it easily when I need the information in the future.</p>

<p>Also, as a brief aside, is jQuery worth learning? Or should I look at different JavaScript libraries? I know Jeff uses jQuery on Stack Overflow and it seems to be working well.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: jQuery's website has a <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">pretty big list of tutorials</a>, and a seemingly comprehensive <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation page</a>. I haven't had time to go through it all yet, has anyone else had experience with it?</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: It seems Google is now hosting the jQuery libraries. That should give jQuery a pretty big advantage in terms of publicity. </p>

<p>Also, if everyone uses a single unified aQuery library hosted at the same place, it should get cached for most Internet users early on and therefore not impact the download footprint of your site should you decide to use it.</p>

<h2>2 Months Later...</h2>

<p><strong>Edit 3</strong>: I started using jQuery on a project at work recently and it is great to work with! Just wanted to let everyone know that I have concluded it is <strong><em>ABSOLUTELY</em></strong> worth it to learn and use jQuery.</p>

<p>Also, I learned almost entirely from the Official jQuery <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page"" rel=""nofollow"">documentation</a> and <a href=""http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials"" rel=""nofollow"">tutorials</a>. It's very straightforward.</p>

<h2>10 Months Later...</h2>

<p>jQuery is a part of just about every web app I've made since I initially wrote this post. It makes progressive enhancement a breeze, and helps make the code maintainable.</p>

<p>Also, all the jQuery plug-ins are an invaluable resource!</p>

<h2>3 Years Later...</h2>

<p>Still using jQuery just about every day. I now author jQuery plug-ins and consult full time. I'm primarily a Djangonaut but I've done several javascript only contracts with jQuery. It's a life saver.</p>

<p>From one jQuery user to another... You should look at <a href=""http://api.jquery.com/category/plugins/templates/"" rel=""nofollow"">templating with jQuery</a> (or underscore -- see below).</p>

<p>Other things I've found valuable in addition to jQuery (with estimated portion of projects I use it on):</p>

"191043","<p>The Separat*ion* of Layout and Content is the domain of CSS and HTML - so far well understood. Now about separat*ing*...</p>

<p>I'm looking for hints and Best Practices to get started with the task of providing a ""skin"" or ""theme"" for a content management system. </p>

<h2>Background:</h2>

<p>We are starting to embrace a Portal Server/Content Management System and are starting to change the look and feel to match our needs.</p>

<p>Our designer has so far mainly worked with full control over HTML and CSS, tweaking either one in order to get pixelperfect layout. With adoption of the cms there's a lot precreated HTML (very semantic, almost no tables :) that needs to be skinned with CSS and Images. Though it is possible to change the HTML fragments, I'd prefer to do so only as a last resort.</p>

<p>As this provides the challenge of ""how to get started"" my question is about any tipps how to proceed or articles that can help managing or organizing this task - e.g. best practices in designing, how to slice this task or what tool to use.</p>

<p>It seems bad practice to just save a dynamically generated page to disk and make changes locally. This would be somewhat ok for the css files but changes to html elements must be retrofitted to the fragments that they are generated from. I'd like to keep this out of the designers realm if possible. Also the thought of Dreamweaver (or any similar tool) making implicit tweaks to the HTML structure is frightening for me.</p>

<p><em>For the curious: The mentioned CMS/Portalserver is <a href=""http://www.liferay.com"" rel=""nofollow"">Liferay</a>, but the question is really language- and tool-agnostic.</em></p>

<p>We have a legacy application.  The 'infrastructure' is running just fine.  Business logic and data access layers written in VB calling SQL Server for the database.</p>

<p>I have a LOT of experience writing Winforms (desktop) application and have had no problems.  However, the last time I wrote any ASP.NET stuff was in 1.1 (VS.NET 2003).</p>

<p>Among other things, for ASP.NET 2.0 and up, the Grid layout is gone.  It's not just a simple case of dropping controls on a form, aligning them, ordering them and working with the code-behind anymore.</p>

<p>The new web-based application is starting out pretty simple.  Just a common header (already made a user control for that) and footer with your typical CRUD functions in the middle.  </p>

<p>I tried being 'intuative' in using a master page with content place holders but I couldn't get the placeholders to ""grow"", to say nothing of not being able to put a text box where I wanted one.  Oh, I found the option in VS2008 to allow absolute positioning but it only worked for SOME controls - others I had to manually edit the asp tags.</p>

<p>Then I saw examples using div's and tried to implement them but I ended up with results that had objects writing on top of each other.  The online help wasn't helpful to say the least.</p>

<p>Does anyone know of a good book, website or tutorial that can give the basics of what I'm looking for?  In practice, I'm looking to make simple pages where some objects may have to push others gurther down the y-axis (as in, several comments being made and that section would push the section listing the 'attachments' down further).  I have no trouble when it comes to all the other aspects of this application.  It just appears that my webforms skills are about 3-4 years out of date.</p>

<p>This isn't going to be some fancy flash/silverlight application - just simple 'data maintenance' to get rid of some ugly and bug-prone processes involving reading common mailboxes and decoding Word files.  The new goal is to have a nice weborm with proper validation.</p>

<p>Thanks for the help, I was very wary about editing the source code since this operation had been so easy on Ubuntu, but I'll be more willing to try that in the future. I'm really missing Ubuntu's ""apt-get"" command; it makes life very easy and simple sometimes. I already have an Ubuntu <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMware"" rel=""nofollow"">VMware</a> image running on my Mac, so I can always use that as a fallback (plus it more closely matches my production machines so should be a good test environment for debugging production problems.)</p>

"398579","<p>I have been programming in Python, PHP, Java and C for a couple or years now, and I just finished reading Hackers and Painters, so I would love to give LISP a try!</p>

<p>I understand its totally diferent from what i know and that it won't be easy. Also I think (please correct me if I'm wrong) there's way less community and development around LISP. So my question is: what's the best way to learn LISP?</p>

<p>I wouldn't mind buying books or investing some time. I just don't want it to be wasted.</p>

<p>The ""final"" idea would be to use LISP for web development, and I know that's not so common so... I know it's good to plan my learning before picking the first book or tutorial and spending lots of time on something that may not be the best way! </p>

<p>Thank you all for your answers!</p>

<p><strong>edit:</strong> I read Practical Common Lisp and was: ... long, hard, interesting and definitely got me rolling in Lisp, after that i read the little schemer, and it was short, fun and very very good for my overall programming. So my recommendation would be to read first the little schemer, then (its a couple of hours and its worth it) if you decide lisp(or scheme or whatever dialect) is not what you where looking for, you will still have a very fun new way of thinking about recursion!</p>

"401014","<p>I've been doing some WPF development for the last few months, and I've recently started Silverlight development.</p>

<p>Most of the time things go OK, especially for the simple stuff, but frequently I get stumped by seemingly simple things - especially in XAML. As an example, yesterday I was trying to use a Grid to lay out the items in a ListBox. This worked, but I couldn't get the grid to stretch to fill the width of the ListBox. Only after some hours of searching, forum posts, and experimentation was I able to get it working, but I can't say I have it figured out.</p>

<p>So, my question is how do you <strong>learn</strong> WPF or Silverlight? - XAML in particular, really. What techniques do you use to understand how controls achieve what they do on the screen, how they are structured, etc. Is there something I'm missing?</p>

<p>Really, this is a major sticking point, and something that Microsoft needs to address to get the hordes of developers up and running with WPF/Silverlight efficiently!</p>

"405078","<p>I'm writing a time management application and I have an idea for presenting timelines and todo items in 3D. Visually, I imagine this as looking down a corridor or highway in 3D, with upcoming deadlines and tasks represented as signposts - more important items are larger and upcoming deadlines are nearer.</p>

<p>I want to do this in Java, however I have no idea how to begin. For example, I would like to be able to render text and 2D graphics (dates, calendars etc) on the floor/walls of the corridoor, as well as on task items. The tasks themselves could be simple blocks. However examples of 3D code I have seen all look to operate on a very low level, and what I can't figure out are the appropriate co-ordinates to be using, or how the user would be able to interact with the view by selecting items with the mouse (for example clicking an expand or info button to get/edit task properties with the usual swing components).</p>

<li>an iPhone</li>
<li>a MacBook</li>

<li>Beginner's knowledge of object-oriented programming from going through simple Java and C# tutorials (Head Start C# book and my wife's intro to OOP course that used Java)</li>
<li>I have managed to display a 3D textured model and spin it using a tutorial in C# I got off the net (I didn't just copy and paste, I understand basically how it works) and the XNA game development library, using Visual Studio on Windows.</li>

<ul>
<li>Much about Objective C</li>
<li>Anything about OpenGL or OpenGL ES, which the iPhone apparently uses</li>
<li>Anything about XCode</li>

I found an OpenGL book but I don't know how much, if any, applies to iPhone development. And I find the Objective C syntax somewhat confusing, with the weird nested method naming, things like ""id"" that don't make sense, and the scary thought that I have to do manual memory management.</p>

<p>Where is the best place to start? I couldn't find any tutorials for this sort of thing, but maybe my Google-Fu is weak. Or maybe I should start with learning Objective C? I know of books like Aaron Hillgrass', but I've also read that they are outdated and much of the sample code doesn't work on the iPhone SDK, plus it seems geared towards the Model-View-Controller paradigm which doesn't seem that suited for 3D apps.</p>

"453141","<p>After reading quite some threads here at StackOverflow, 
I have come to the conclusion that I should adopt to some form of 
test driven development/unit test (or at least explore the area).</p>

<p>And since we are talking about c code under Linux, 
I decided to give <a href=""http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check.html/index.html"">check</a> a try 
(I don't know if this is the right choice but if it's no good I can always try something else later on).</p>

<p>But since this concept of unit test and unit test frameworks is totally new to me, 
I started out to do some unit test on a really small test code (but I was totally lost anyway and it felt like I was missing something).</p>

<p>This is what I have done so far, I created the following file:</p>

<ul>
<li>main.c, a main that only calls a function called my_pow and prints the result.</li>
<li>my_pow.c, contains the function my_pow.</li>
<li>my_pow.h  </li>
<li>my_pow_test.c, I figured that I should place the unit code for the my_pow function here.</li>
</ul>

<p>(So the ""normal program"" is the main.c, my_pow.c and my_pow.h.)</p>

<p>This is my_pow.c</p>

<pre>
<code>
#include ""my_pow.h""
int my_pow(int a, int b)
{
    return (a*b);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>Then I figured that in my_pow_test.c I put something like this:</p>

<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;check.h&gt;
#include ""my_pow.h""

START_TEST (test_my_pow)
{
    /* unit test code */
}
END_TEST

//do I need some sort off main here that calls test_my_pow?
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is basically the same as in <a href=""http://check.sourceforge.net/doc/check.html/index.html"">the check manual</a> chapter 3.1, 
but still not....</p>

<p>Could someone please push me in the right direction?</p>

<p>Thanks 
Johan</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Update: No reason why I tried to use check I just thought I should start somewhere,
maybe CUnit is a better choice (I think I would try that as well and then make a educated choice).</p>

<p>Update: Thanks @philippe for indirectly pointing out that the on-line documentation is only half of the truth, 
the example code that clarifies what the documentation talks about was already installed with the check package.
In the Ubuntu case /usr/share/doc/check/example/tests/</p>

<p>Update: The code example was created so that you started out by looking at his first version, 
then the second one etc etc. So that you could follow how he creates a very basic test case/code from nothing up to something that is useful in a traditional TTD way. </p>

<p>And since my code was broken and I wanted the unit test to prove this, 
I cheated a little and tested against the real pow function.
Something like this: </p>

<pre>
<code>
START_TEST (test_my_pow1)
{
    int resultat = my_pow(3,3);
    int math     = pow(3,3);
    fail_unless ( resultat == math,
           ""Error on 3^3 != %d (%d)"",math, resultat);
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>However in the future I will not reproduce what is already in the stdlibs :-)</p>

<p><strong>My personal opinion</strong> is still that it would be good to <strong>start from level zero</strong>, even if the language itself is not <em>directly</em> contributive to the things I make.

But then again, like said, my knowledge of these languages is quite limited, so I'd love to hear <strong>your thoughts</strong> on the matter aswell.</p>

"490990","<p>Often one of the main reasons given for learning C is that it brings you closer to programming at a low level which gives you insights into how things really work in higher level languages.</p>

"495823","<p>I'm new to grails. I'd like to give it a whirl by implementing a new feature or two into an existing Java EE application. The current Java EE app is a fairly standard Spring MVC/Hibernate app running on Tomcat.  Looking through the documentation, it looks like I should be able to leverage all of the current business logic that's written in Java.  </p>

<p>I've only been able to find tutorials on creating new grails applications.  Does anyone know of a tutorial for integrating with an existing Java EE app?  If not a tutorial, any recommendations or suggestions on where to start?  </p>

<p>Whether or not those features go live would depend on my experience with Grails and if I think it's worthwhile using it going forward.  The goal would to either:</p>

<li>Decide Grails isn't for me (and not deploy grails).</li>

<p>Unfortunately, the CS program I'm considering teaches C++ rather than Java, so C++ is what I'm learning.  (I'm sure learning C++ will teach me to code well, but so would Java, and then I could get a job.  It's frustrating that CS programs stick with languages they've used for 20 years instead of teaching languages that will help their students succeed.)</p>

<p>My question is whether it's a good idea to crack open the Java books on my shelf after I finish my C++ homework.  Will I just end up confused, or will I end up better at both?  Has anyone learned both C++ and Java simultaneously?</p>

<p>I'm almost done with my junior year as a CS major.  I sort of feel like a late comer because I didn't really get into computer science until sophomore year...   Through hard work, lots of credit hours during the year and summer school I am almost caught up to my peers but here come the worries:</p>

<p>All of my school work has taught me a lot about computer science but little about practical programing.  Although I have a lot of motivation, I simply have almost no free time to allow me to pick up side projects. This upsets me for 2 reasons, 1) I genuinely am becoming very passionate about the field and 2) I understand that many employers like to see students with some experience outside of school.  </p>

<p>So I recently had an idea:  what if I were to make Linux my primary OS but restrict myself to the terminal as much as possible in an attempt to naturally (with the help of google) become familiar with the command line and hopefully gradually pick up shell scripting using online tutorials.</p>

<p>How beneficial do you think this would be to an aspiring programmer?  How realistic is it?  Do you have any other suggestions for small projects a student with barely any free time can pick up outside of school?</p>

"554847","<p>Just would like some thoughts of what you think about my strategy to learn C++. While I understand that it takes years to master a programming language, I simply want to get to the point where I can be considered competent as quickly as possible. Why quickly? Well when I say <em>quickly</em> I'm really saying I'm committed, and that I don't want it to take forever where forever is never. If it takes five years to become competent, it takes five years. I'm not expecting 24 hours or 30 days.</p>

<p>About me: I don't have a CS degree, I have an anthropology degree and a Masters in library science. Learning the CS fundamentals such as Big O notation, and basics such as binary trees and linked lists, sort algorithms has been a challenge. Probably nothing substitutes a good CS degree. :( I do have many years programming experience, starting with PHP in 2001, ActionScript, 2003, JavaScript soon after. I have been writing programs in Python for about two years now and I have learned C (by reading the K&amp;R book and writing some programs), but I'm probably not going to get hired for a C job. Also recently learned Objective C. I work as a JavaScript &amp; Python, &amp; CSS developer at a website at the moment.</p>

<p>Anyhow, this is my strategy: Read the Stroustrup book (I just started on Part I) and at the same time start a simple C++ project, while also doing many of the Stroustrup exercises.</p>

"557948","<p><strong>Note:</strong> Anyone coming to this question now, mind the date. This question is nearly 4 years old and the information is relatively outdated. In my experience NHibernate now is relatively easy to use (with the fluent interface), Entity Framework is a legitimate contender, and MicroORMS such as Dapper and Massive are becoming quite popular.</p>

<hr>

<p>We are re-writing one of our core web applications and I finally got the all clear from management to replace the horrible tangle of stored procedures with an ORM framework for implementing our data access layer.</p>

<p>Hooray for me.  Now I have to choose one.</p>

<p>I have played around a little bit with the following</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.hibernate.org/343.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NHibernate</a></li>
<li><a href=""http://www.castleproject.org/ActiveRecord/"" rel=""nofollow"">Castle ActiveRecord</a> (We would use it to power our DTO objects)</li>
<li><a href=""http://subsonicproject.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">Subsonic</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Now I know that NHibernate is the true Alt.Netty choice but the problem is that I am working with contractors who as far as I know have never heard of it, and NHibernate has a reputation for quite a learning curve.  Subsonic in the meantime seems like a far more straightforward approach.  I also am aware of the <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa697427%28VS.80%29.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">Entities Framework</a> but am wary of its 'meh' reception and <a href=""http://www.codeplex.com/LinqToOracle"" rel=""nofollow"">Linq to Oracle</a> but am wary of the fact that I've hardly heard anything about it.</p>

<p>So the questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there any more frameworks I should be considering?</li>
<li>Which do you recommend for my situation?</li>
</ol>

<p>Some more considerations:</p>

<ul>
<li>When I say I have a played around a bit with these frameworks, I mean it.  I have configured them and used them to pull in some data to make sure it all works.  That's the extent of it.</li>
<li>This is an Oracle database (as you might have guessed from the inclusion of Linq2Oracle)</li>
<li>Since this is a re-write, the database already exists and has a stable schema</li>
<li>I am not too worried about performance.  Our application usually serves at most a couple people at a time.</li>
<li>You guys are the ones who are going to have to answer the torrent of questions I'm gonna have</li>

<p>The issue I run into though is that there are a fair bit of related technologies that are currently used in the Rails community, and I'm not sure if I should learn the whole shebang or focus on learning Rails with the defaults first, and then branch out into the additional stuff.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Templates.  I took a look at <strong>Haml</strong> and it looks really cool (shouldn't be hard to learn either).</li>
<li>Testing.  I've wanted to learn test driven development for a while now, but the ""next big thing"" in Rails-land seems to be behavior driven development with <strong>RSpec</strong></li>
<li>Javascript.  I'm not sure if I should stick with <strong>RJS</strong> or use something like <strong>jQuery</strong> which seems to be converting people.</li>
<li>I've never really used version control much.  Rails seems to be using <strong>Git</strong> for most of it's projects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Basically I want to learn Rails ""right"", but there seems to be a lot of different ways that I could go.  Should I ignore the ""variants"" and focus on the Core stuff until I've written an application or three (e.g. core, unmodified Rails; RJS w/Prototype and Scriptaculous for Ajax, regular Test::Unit for testing, ERB for templating, Git for version control), or should I try to pick up some of the variants along the way?</p>

<p>I want to write a web app which deals securely with relatively modest amounts of peoples private data, a few thousand records of a few Kb each but stuff that needs to be kept safe, addresses, phone numbers etc. I've done several web projects in PHP/MYSQL and have decided, handy though it is I really don't like PHP and don't want to do another large project in it...</p>

<p>As such I figure I'd best learn something new and so I am considering 2 options (although I'll happily entertain others if you have suggestions). I'm having terrible trouble deciding though. They both look quite involved so rather than just jump in and potentially waste days getting up to speed enough on both of them to make an informed choice I thought I'd come here and canvas some opinion.</p>

<p>So the two options I'm considering are...</p>

<p><strong>One of the PYTHON Web frameworks</strong> - TurboGears seems well regarded?
Advantage: Of all the languages I ever tried Python is by far and away my favorite. There's loads of frameworks to choose from and I have done quite a lot of non web python coding over the last few years. 
Disadvantage: There's loads to choose from so it's hard to pick! Need to run single server process? or mod_python? which I don't like the sound of. What I do like is the notion of process separation and compartmentalization, i.e. if one users account is compromised it gives an attacker no leverage against the rest of the system. I'm not clear to what extent a python solution would handle that.</p>

<p><strong>Writing it as a SEASIDE app</strong> Which I guess runs on a squeak app server?
Adv: From what I've heard it would permit good compartmentalization of users as each would have their own little private VM independent of all the systems other users which sounds wonderful from a security, scaling and redundancy standpoint.
Dis: I've not done any Smalltalk since Uni 15 years back and I never dug too deep into it then. I don't see much entry level help for seaside or that many projects using it. I suspect setting a server up to run it is hard for the same reason i.e. not because it's inherently hard but just cause there will be less help online and a presumption you are already rather au fait with Sqeak/Smalltalk.</p>

<p>So, what do people think? Would I be able to efficiently get the kind of strong separation and compartmentalization I'm after with a Python framework? Is Seaside as good as I think in terms of insulating users from each other? Might I be better off, security wise, sticking to the languages I'm most familiar with so I don't make any n00b mistakes or will Seaside be worth worth scaling the learning curve and prove more secure, comprehensible and maintainable in the long run? At the end of the day it's not a life or death decision and I can always bail if I start with one and then hate it so pls nobody get all holy language war and start flaming anyone! ;-)</p>

"733093","<p>According to this <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/06/rich-programmer-food.html</a>  article, I defnitely should.  </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Quote  Gentle, yet insistent executive
  summary: If you don't know how
  compilers work, then you don't know
  how computers work. If you're not 100%
  sure whether you know how compilers
  work, then you don't know how they
  work.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I thought that it was a very interesting article, and the field of application is very useful (do yourself a favour and read it) 
But then again, I have seen successful senior sw engineers that didn’t know compilers very well, or internal machine architecture for that matter, 
but did know a thing or two of each item in the following list :</p>

<ul>
<li>A programming paradigm (OO, functional,…)</li>
<li>A programming    language  API (C#, Java..) and at    least 2 very different some say!    (Java / Haskell) </li>
<li>A programming    framework (Java, .NET) </li>
<li>An IDE to    make you more productive (Eclipse,    VisualStudio, Emacs,….) </li>
<li>Programming    best practices (see fxcop rules for    example) </li>
<li>Programming Principles    (DRY, High Cohesion, Low Coupling,    ….) </li>
<li>Programming methodologies (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven%5Fdevelopment"">TDD</a>,    <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%5FDriven%5FEngineering"">MDE</a>)    </li>
<li>Design patterns (Structural,    Behavioural,….)  </li>
<li>Architectural    Basics (Tiers, Layers, Process Models    (Waterfall, Agile,…) </li>
<li>A Testing Tool    (Unit Testing, Model Testing, …)   </li>
<li>A GUI  technique (WPF, Swing)    </li>
<li>A documenting tool (Javadoc,    Sandcastle..)    </li>
<li>A modelling languague    (and tool maybe) (UML,    VisualParadigm, Rational)         </li>
<li>(undoubtedly forgetting very    important stuff here)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not all of these tools are necessary to be a good programmer (like a GUI when you just don’t need it)
but most of them are.  Where do compilers come in, and are they really that important, since, as I mentioned, 
lots of programmers seems to be doing fine without knowing them and especially, becoming a  good programmer is seen the multitude of knowledge domains almost a lifetime achievement :-) , so even if compilers are extremely important, isn't  there always stuff still more important?  </p>

<p>Or should i order 'The Unleashed Compilers Unlimited Bible (in 24H..))) today?</p>

<p>In this case, we need to pass some information that identifies a user to a 3rd party service which will then call back to a service on our website with the information plus a hash. </p>

<p>The 2nd service looks up info on that user and then passes it back to the 3rd party service.</p>

<p>What I have is a Code::Blocks C project in a folder on my laptop's hard drive. I opened Git and created a new repository on a USB hard drive. I figured, I could create a branch, which led to the already-existing directory of my project, and then commit all the code in it to the repository. Then every time I wanted to work on this project, I could check out my code, open up the Code::Blocks project and edit. And then get into different branches and stuff, you know, all that jazz.</p>

<p>So I created this repository, and went to create a branch from the menu. I got this dialog, which asked me for either a branch name, or to ""Match Tracking Branch Name (whatever that means)."" Then, under ""Starting Revision,"" it has a few options. One is ""Revision expression"" next to a text box, and no matter what I enter it is an invalid revision expression. So I tried the other options, ""Local Branch,"" ""Tracking Branch,"" and ""Tag."" These enable another text box, but even if ""Revision expression"" isn't selected, it still says I have entered an invalid one. What is a revision expression? How do I just, check out code, to a directory on my hard drive?</p>

<p>Oh, and then, there is an ""Options"" section with ""Update Existing Branch: [ ] No  [x] Fast Forward Only  [ ] Reset,""<br />
and two check boxes, ""Fetch Tracking Branch"" and ""Check Out After Creation (this one is obvious)."" What do all of these mean? What's a tracking branch? What does ""Fast Forward Only"" and ""Reset"" refer to? I have no idea what I'm doing or what I've gotten myself into.</p>

"997144","<p>I have been working with the Microsoft stack, and would like to get a little bit of experience with alternative stacks, like LAMP, in my spare time.</p>

<p>The P in LAMP, is usually ""PHP"", but can be Perl (or Python, but I am considering Perl or PHP above Python.). I am gravitating towards Perl, because it looks like it would be useful in other applications, and because Perl seems to have a reputation as 'smarter' and 'better' than PHP. </p>

<p>Pros for Perl:  </p>

<ul>
<li>Better reputation. PHP has a bad reputation for having bad design decisions and a lot of bad programs written in it.  </li>
<li>Can be used for non-web programs.  </li>
<li>More people seem to LOVE Perl, but even the PHP community is lukewarm to PHP.  </li>
</ul>

<p>Pros for PHP:  </p>

<ul>
<li>More webservers have PHP installed already than have Perl.</li>
<li>Easier to get started since some of the architectural problems having to do with the web are solved for you.</li>
<li>PHP is a popular language that is used for most sites currently on the internet.</li>
<li>Knowing PHP seems more likely to be of use in my job.</li>

Some of the reasons David mentioned: <br /></p>

<ul>
  <li>ASP.NET MVC was inspired by Rails and in order for me to be a smarter ASP.NET MVC Developer I feel like I need to know Rails.</li>
  <li>IronRuby is well on its way to being released which has got me excited about learning a new language, Ruby.</li>
  <li>I really, really like Cucumber and RSpec and would love to use them for BDD via IronRuby on my ASP.NET MVC C# Projects.</li>
<li>I think it would be cool to develop ASP.NET MVC Web Application using Ruby via IronRuby.</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think guys? Is it really important for ASP.NET MVC developers to learn Ruby on Rails? If we are evaluating this option on a scale of 5 degrees ( Urgent-Important, Urgent-Not Important, Not Urgent-Important, Not Urgent-Not Important, A Total Waste of Time), what would your choice be guys, hopefully you will mention some benefits resulting from your experience working with both. Some articles, blog-posts on that subject are totally appreciated. <br />

"1173539","<p>I am trying to design a script for the automation of a very tedious configuration process we had been doing by hand.

<p>There's also some Protege and MS SQL Server business involved, but that is not much trouble to do by hand.  I am more concerned with the endless copying and pasting that is prone to human error. The configuration process is mostly done in Windows XP, but there's also a fair number of scripts run on Red Hat Linux.</p>

"1177181","<p>Judging from my knowledge of the history of firmware engineering tools, practices etc.  It has consistently lagged behind the software engineering field by several years.  For example, as far as I can tell there is still a fair amount of debate in the firmware world as to whether C++ is actually worth using for our applications, and some C++ compilers are noticeably absent (microchip?!?).  I imagine that in large part this is due to the differences in requirements between firmware and software.  Again, judging from history, it seems its only a matter of time before the properly vetted tools and techniques make it into the firmware world.</p>

<p>What methods, tools, best practices etc that modern software engineers use regularly, could firmware engineers also leverage to improve their craft?</p>

<p>Specifically I'm thinking along the following axes (but don't let them limit you):</p>

<ul>
<li>Improving code cleanliness/maintainability</li>
<li>Reducing defect introduction and improving detection</li>
<li>Improving documentation</li>
<li>Requirements management</li>

<p><strong>UPDATE 2</strong><br />
I'm getting a lot of good general programming advice in the answers so far, which is great, but I'm really looking for more unconventional approaches that have proved successful for people.  I'm trying to tease out the Agile practitioners, the TDDers, and the rest of you who have tried stuff and seen it pay off in spades or fail horribly.  As a software engineer has there been a tool or practice that you've adopted in the past several years that has had a remarkably positive or negative impact?</p>

"1276356","<p>I'm trying to build a web application that is similar to Youtube (it's not a knock off), but I guess I don't know how video is served on the internet very well.</p>

<p>I know how to build regular database driven web applications, but nothing like the scalability of Youtube. All of the applications I have built before have all been run on one server with the files stored on the same box as the web server.</p>

<p>How does one decouple the application server from the file storage from the media server?</p>

<p>I would more or less want 4 machines (clusters of machines)</p>

<p>1.) Application servers
  -- Present the web page, handle user uploads, link the user's flash player to the correct media server etc.</p>

<p>2.) Database shards
  -- Store user information, check favorites, etc.</p>

<p>3.) File storage
  -- Store the media files</p>

<p>4.) Media servers
   -- Serve the media files</p>

<p>How do I hook all of this together? Which technologies should I leverage? Where do I go to learn more about architecting this?</p>

<p>How does Youtube's embeddable flash stuff work? I want to embed my flash player on other websites and have it tie into my architecture.</p>

<p>Note I have looked into: <a href=""http://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture"" rel=""nofollow"">http://highscalability.com/youtube-architecture</a></p>

<p>But I still don't get the overall picture of how this stuff ties together.</p>

<p>If someone can explain in high level terms how all of this stuff works?</p>

<p>Are there dedicated client servers running internally to shuffle around all of this stuff between the application servers, file storage, etc. Is it all via HTTP using JSON, what is going on here!</p>

"1279359","<p>I'm currently participating in a programming contest (<a href=""http://contest.github.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://contest.github.com</a>), which has as goal, to create a recommendation engine. I started coding in <strong>ruby</strong>, but soon realised it wasn't fast enough for the algorithms I had in mind. So I switched to <strong>C</strong>, which is the only non-scripting language I know. It was fast, of course, but I cringed every time I had to write a <code>for</code> loop, to go through the elements of an array (which was very often).</p>

<p>That's when it dawned: I wish I knew a fast, yet high-level language, to program all these intensive computations with ease!</p>

<p>So I looked at my options, but there are a lot of options these days! Here the best candidates I've found over the months, with something which bothers me about each of them (that hopefully you can clear up):</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Clojure</strong>: I'm not sure I want to get into the whole <code>lisp</code> thing, I like my syntax and cruft. I could be convinced, though.</li>
<li><strong>Haskell</strong>: Too academic? I don't really care for <em>pure</em> functional, I just want something which works. But it has nice syntax, and I don't mind static typing.</li>
<li><strong>Scala</strong>: Weird language. I tried it out but it feels messy/inconsistent to me.</li>
<li><strong>OCaml</strong>: Also wondering if this is too academic? The poor concurrency support also bothers me.</li>
<li><strong>Arc</strong>: Paul Graham's lisp, too obscure, and again, I'm not sure I want to learn a lisp. But I trust this man!</li>
</ul>

<p>Any advice? I really like the functional languages, for their ability to manipulate lists with ease, but I'm open to other options too. I'd like something about as fast as Java..</p>

<p>The kind of things I want to be able to do with lists are like (ruby): </p>

<pre><code>([1, 2, 3, 4] - [2, 3]).map {|i| i * 2 } # which results in [2, 8]
</code></pre>

<p>I would also prefer an open-source language.</p>

"1280243","<p>Hey guys, hope this isn't too much of a n00b question</p>

<p>I'm mainly a front end developer that has recently started to do some back end programming. The script I'm working on is pretty simple (in theory). I just don't know where to begin and was hoping for some advice that will lead me in the right direction.</p>

<p>-The script is essentially a simple data logger.<br />
-Everyday the user logs into the website, where it brings them to a single page.
-The user then checks an input box and enters a value into another input box
-That number is stored in the database</p>

<p>That's pretty much it.  It seems pretty simple, but the problem is that there needs to be one administrator account that can read all the inputs of all other users.</p>

<p><strong>My Question:</strong> 
What is the BEST way to start this project?  I have absolutely no clue on how to start it.  Should I create classes for each of the functions (user logging in, user inputting value)? Should I use a framework?  What would be the first steps you would take as a programmer.</p>

<p>I know this isn't a specific question, but like I said, I'm new to writing scripts that involve dealing with the backend and all that fun stuff.  Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggestions on where I can find information for a total beginner on how to use one of these services as the back end for updating my blog and have the posts show up in my own website at my own website domain?  ie have the url be www.mywebsite.com/blog as part of my website?  <br> </p>

<p>I really have no clue where to start.  To sum it up i need to learn how to do 2 things:</p>

<p>1) Skin my own blog using my knowledge of css and html and design skills - and know what service is best and why</p>

<p>2) How can i make this blog part of my website domain like the example url above.  Also what is this even called?  I'm not sure what the term would be to even search for it on my own.</p>

"1441319","<p>A developer I am working with is developing a program that analyzes images of pavement to find cracks in the pavement. For every crack his program finds, it produces an entry in a file that tells me which pixels make up that particular crack. There are two problems with his software though:</p>

<p>1) It produces several false positives</p>

<p>2) If he finds a crack, he only finds small sections of it and denotes those sections as being separate cracks.</p>

<p>My job is to write software that will read this data, analyze it, and tell the difference between false-positives and actual cracks. I also need to determine how to group together all the small sections of a crack as one.</p>

<p>I have tried various ways of filtering the data to eliminate false-positives, and have been using neural networks to a limited degree of success to group cracks together. I understand there will be error, but as of now, there is just too much error. Does anyone have any insight for a non-AI expert as to the best way to accomplish my task or learn more about it? What kinds of books should I read, or what kind of classes should I take?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> My question is more about how to notice patterns in my coworker's data and identify those patterns as actual cracks. It's the higher-level logic that I'm concerned with, not so much the low-level logic.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> In all actuality, it would take AT LEAST 20 sample images to give an accurate representation of the data I'm working with. It varies a lot. But I do have a sample <a href=""http://img23.imageshack.us/img23/678/150000004027crackmap.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, <a href=""http://img200.imageshack.us/img200/8981/150000200207crackmap.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>, and <a href=""http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/184/150001201297crackmap.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. These images have already been processed by my coworker's process. The red, blue, and green data is what I have to classify (red stands for dark crack, blue stands for light crack, and green stands for a wide/sealed crack).</p>

"1443634","<p>This question is inevitably subjective, but I will ask anyway.</p>

<p>I'm a PC. I've always been a PC. I have very little Apple expertise, although I'm completely happy in *nix. I've plenty of experience with development, and consider that I am able to pick up new languages and concepts faster than most of my colleagues (although ML/F# still hurts me on a regular basis). I'm reasonably familiar with C++, although haven't touched it since the nineties, work on a daily basis, and 100% confident with C#,  would consider myself advanced to expert with Java and have developed a reasonable amount of stuff in Lisp and Prolog back in the day.</p>

<p>We've had a recent request to develop an iPhone app, which sounds like quite an interesting proposition that we'd be quite interested in taking on. We have very little in-house experience with Apple platforms. Given our ignorance of most things Apple, little to no familiarity with OSX and the Apple UI paradigms and assuming we acquire the necessary hardware for development:</p>

<li>What one would need to learn?</li>
<li>How long would a good developer need to get up to speed?</li>
<li>Are there any non-obvious expenses that might arise from pursuing this route?</li>

"1506301","<p>I am interested in getting my feet wet in PDA/mobile development.
The only two drivers for me are the drive to learn cool (or at least, new) stuff, and may be to code some app that I felt I really needed but lacked. </p>

<p>As such, I would like to know what the comparative benefits/downsides would be for me as a developer in choosing one of the three platforms (iPhone vs Palm Pre vs. Android - I will have access to any of the 3 but not to Windows mobile). E.g. </p>

<ul>
<li><p>What exciting new technologies I can learn? </p></li>
<li><p>How good the available development environments are? </p></li>
<li><p>What existing frameworks/libraries are available or are under active development?</p></li>
<li><p>How well documented the platform and APIs are?</p></li>
<li><p>What neat features of the platform are accessible via the APIs vs. blocked off?</p></li>
<li><p>Any other developer-centric considerations I missed?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am pretty open to either the benefits of leveraging my existing skill-set to ease the learning curve, or the benefits of learning something entirely new and cool, so while I'm curious how the platforms' development relates to my current set (recently, Perl, SQL, web development, C++ and some Java, but I'm also quite comfortable with functional programming), so it will not be a deciding point.</p>

<p>NOTE: This is not a duplicate of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1092144/what-mobile-platform-should-i-start-learning"">this question</a>, since I do not care at all about that question's data points (cost of the handheld, popularity of the platform). Also, just to be clear, my goal is not financial at all - I don't plan to make money off of such development nor directly use the skills in the area I might obtain in my career (e.g. I work on stuff that has zilch mobile exposure and will remain so). So concerns such as ""installed user base"" are pretty irrelevant. All I care about are tangible (learning) and intangible (sheer joy of it) benefits to me as a developer.</p>

<p>Also, <strong>please be positive and don't put down other platforms or otherwise use this as a holy platform war excuse</strong>. I have edit privileges and will mercilessly edit any un-backed-up-by-facts attacks on any platform that aren't downvoted. </p>

"1535234","<p>There's a gap in my SQL knowledge I'd like to fill and I'm after recommendations on where to find resources, eg. websites, how-tos, books, etc.</p>

<p>I've been using SQL databases for a long time. I'm quite comfortable with: basic SQL and its syntax; creating tables and indexes; inserting data; and basic DBMS maintanenance.</p>

<p>Where I struggle is getting the data out for anything beyond basic SELECT statements. I've recently got my head around some basic INNER JOINs and GROUP BY so I can use commands like SUM and MAX. But the ""SQL way"", ie. set logic, eludes me. Is there a solid overview of this stuff so I can properly understand set logic, JOINs (all types), nested SELECTs, WITH, CROSS APPLY, ROW_NUMBER(), etc.</p>

<p>I've found a couple of good questions on SO (<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/201328/semi-advanced-sql-tutorial-ebook-video-something"">here</a> and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/343709/book-recommendation-for-advanced-sql-design-scripting-and-optimiziation"">here</a>). But the answers are a bit too general. I don't want a beginners guide to SQL or databases. I get that. I'm after stuff on the relatively narrow topic of smart queries. Vendor-agnostic stuff would be preferable. Many thanks.</p>

<p>In summary, my question is: can you recommend some good resources (online or print) to help me learn how to take my SQL queries beyond the basic level. That is, something other than introductory/basic texts. As I said, I'm comfortable with the basics, I need intermediate to advanced coverage of SQL queries.</p>

<p>UPDATE 2009-10-12 re Selected Answer: A wide variety of answers, mostly recommending books, rather than online resources, which was a bit of a surprise to me. Many authors were recommended (here and in other SO questions). The two most popular were Chris Date and Joe Celko. It was difficult to pick not having read either. What settled it in the end was DBA friend had a copy of <em>SQL for Smarties</em> I could borrow, but nothing from Date.</p>

"1560235","<p>I would like to say upfront that i am not a programmer. I'm 1 of 3 partners in a small start up. Two of us have a business and sales background, whilst the third guy is a very experienced Java Programmer/engineer (and a good friend). </p>

<p>As with most start ups we believe we'll be the next big website. We have found a opportunity that the ""Long Tail"" really describes well. By this i mean a product range that isn't currently being tapped into online. As with Amazon, our model is about offering every available product within the niche. Through the availability of everything outside the fast selling products, we hope to become best website for the niche. </p>

<p>We have placed a lot of focus on building the business/technology system that allows us to build our inventory information very quickly. This was because we knew that the size of our inventory would make or break our usefulness to end users.</p>

<p>So now i come to the problem that prompted me to seek your help.... (please help)... :)</p>

<p>In my (non-technical business) mind, we now have the ability to build our inventory quickly. This is just the start though, as a business we also need the following solutions before making money:</p>

<ul>
<li>A shopping cart application to<br />
allow buyers to search our inventory,
communicate with our business and<br />
make orders etc. </li>
<li>A CRM application would then
allow the effective management
of customers and orders.</li>
</ul>

<p>I found my way to Magento and SugarCRM both of which appear to be very impressive. The idea being to use Magento for the buyers (search,buy,interact etc) and Sugar for our staff (order processing, customer service etc). </p>

<p>In my mind the long term rewards of being able to update these core applications from the communities, would far outweigh the steep learning curve. Not to mention the time/money that would be required to even attempt to catch up with what already is stable and tested....</p>

<p>My friend and business partner is unwilling to consider anything in PHP and to a large degree opensource. He's of the belief it would be best to start from scratch. </p>

<p>From a language agnostic business person (non-programmer) - any opinions or advise on our situation would be much appreciated...</p>

<p>Our stock is currently held across 30+ different branches. Which means that we'd need a way for each branch to sign in and manage their own customers. </p>

<p>From our operational point of view, these seem to be the key challenges outside standard :</p>

<p>1) Our business has regions and each region has branches. In order for us to focus the various management levels of the business, it would be ideal if each management level could see the business relevant to them. For example National manager (can see everything), Regional manager (can see all branches in his region), Branch manager (can see everything for his branch with certain admin rights) and Customer service (can see everything in their branch with minimal rights). This is the only way we can have one umbrella site, which can be serviced by staff in branches nationally. </p>

<p>2) Over and above managing orders, it also makes sense that the messages are managed centrally through the application. This way any member of staff can easily see the past history with the customer and assist. I'm thinking that the questions would almost always come in through ""Ask a question about this product"" link, so incoming messages could be routed to the branch who has the part. If it's aftersales, then the branch who sold it. For general questions through contact us, we'll allocate a member of staff at head office.</p>

<p>3) I think it would be appropriate to show buyers upfront on the product page which branch has the part and the branch information.</p>

<p>4) Total inventory size is currently over 300,000 products. The business plan is to rapidly increase this to 10 times that figure.</p>

<p>5) The products are spare parts. Therefore the buyer would need to search by the orignal product that the parts fits... Each part can often be used on various products. </p>

"1575854","<p>I've been ""programming"" in <strong>PHP</strong> for about 3 or 4 years I think, and I think I'm pretty good at it already, so decided to move on to something more complex. I understand that PHP is too flexible (you don't have to declare the type of a variable, for example) and that I'll have to get used to code in such ways.</p>

<p>So basically I want to write applications where I could control many CPU cores and create Windowed applications. Being able to use a 3D library like DirectX or OpenGL would be plain awesome.</p>

<p>I really don't know much about languages that would be appropriate for this kind of applications. So, in your opinion, what language should I learn? And what book should I buy to learn it?</p>

"1569132","<p>I understand the concept of Unit Testing as coming up with simple ideas about what your code should output - then outputting it. So it's thinking about what you want a piece of code to do - then making a test to ensure it works.</p>

<p>At which point in learning programming should TDD (unit testing) be incorporated?</p>

<p>Edit: I liked the comment about unit testing as soon as the tools to do it stop becoming magical.</p>

<p>Originally the question came about because I realize I don't have the skills yet to develop a large program, but would like to learn by coming up with ideas for what some piece of code could / should do.</p>

<p>I'm wanting to get into learning by doing and I figure a structured way to do this would help. Python is the language I'm using. Thanks for all the input thus far.</p>

"1584897","<p>I've got some free time and I'm looking to learn a programming language or two that I can use for computational modeling (I'm in cognitive science &amp; psychology).

All I know is a little C, so I have a ways to go.</p>

<p>Could you recommend any programming languages that are commonly used in labs doing computational work? I'm hoping to use what I learn in graduate training in a couple of years. </p>

<p>I also need to pick up a little more math, like differential equations and basic linear algebra. Do you suppose I'd need anything else?</p>

"1592724","<p>What is the quickest/easiest way to learn Java for a seasoned .NET/C# (more than 7 years) and C++ (5years) developer.</p>

<p>When I say to learn Java - I mean being able to write applications in a ""Java way"" using base classes library + where needed using a popular Java libraries (it is great that so many of them are open source).</p>

<p>I know that Java development comes in a lot of flavors - enterprise applicatons (Java EE), mobile devices (Java ME), objects hosted in application servers (to my knowledge Java has a buch of these) - however at the moment I am interested in a general Java development - may be with a some emphasis on a integration projects/enterprise development.</p>

<p>So basically - I am a strong, passionate about technology, proud to be a senior C#/C++ developer with a dozen years of experience who wants to dedicate a month-worth (may be  more) of evenings to learn to effectively program in Java environment.</p>

<p>Having said that I don't mean I am switching from .NET/C++ to Java - but I would probably going have to spend 30%-50% of my devevelpment time developing/supporting/whateverstageintheSDLC in Java.</p>

"1636600","<p>Some background: My job involves maintaining a large multi-threaded multi-process C++ / C# application, and so I'm often tasked with understanding access violations, memory leaks, heap curruption issues and the like.</p>

<p>I quite enjoy this, and I've amassed quite a good understanding of various low level concepts, but the trouble is that <strong>I don't program in C++</strong>, and aside for the purposes of maintenance I don't really intend to.</p>

<p>What I mean by that is that if I ever need to develop something then at the company I work at the best choice is C# (more developers, other apps also in C# means better interops), so its not that I don't program in C++, it's just that whenever I do program in C++ it will be <strong>purely</strong> for the purpose of learning C++, and <strong>so I want to get the most out of it</strong>.</p>

<p>My view is that ""Teach yourself C++"" books and the like aren't very suitable as they focus too much on getting things done - there are usually many ways of doing things and so they tend to pick one method, so when I'm presented with some code that does things a different way I'm stuffed (e.g. a book teaches MFC, I then get presented with some ATL code and the book hasn't even taught me what ATL and MFC are, let alone how to recognise that what I'm looking at is different!)</p>

<p>Notes about each:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I would lean towards the whiteboard, but there are several drawbacks (e.g. cannot make automatic charts, time measurements, metrics, and sometimes I work from home - where I need it most - and it's not convenient to carry :-) </p></li>
<li><p>I don't want to remember another username/password (I promised to myself to signup only to OpenID-enabled services)</p></li>
<li><p>My employer has JIRA but my group doesn't use it - I might ask for an account (it shouldn't require another password) and maybe later involve the rest of the group. But I don't know if they are using greenhopper and if it's a big deal installing it.</p></li>
<li><p>I generally hate spreadsheets</p></li>
<li><p>maybe overkill?</p></li>
<li><p>I'd be happy to have a localhost instance, but it could be problematic to give access to the whole group (per network/firewalls) - not a deal-breaker but surely a concern</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What I'd like to get from this?</p>

<ul>
<li>being more productive</li>
<li>tracking how much time I spend in any given task, possibly discussing the issue with my supervisor</li>

<p><strong>1 -</strong> I've been reading books and drupal API but I'm still having a lot of trouble getting started with anything at all. Where does custom code go in respect to pages, modules, snippets...? How do I replicate form X that I did in ASP.NET into a new page in drupal? Etc. It is super hard to wrap my head around Drupal, it seems so large and easy and extensible yet also like it is difficult for me to code. <strong>What can you recommend for an ASP.NET application programmer to learn to work with/in Drupal?</strong></p>

<p><strong>2 -</strong> Sometimes we write complete ASP.NET applications for clients, and these applications are not indended for clients to go editing them. For example, we will have our entire website in drupal, but inside of that website we will have a place for users to use a special search for database information. We don't want simple website editors and content providers trying to edit this specially coded page(s). <strong>How do I handle not wanting clients to edit anything in a Drupal application?</strong> Is it handled via page/user permissions? Is the best thing to develop and host an application completely outside of drupal? Is the drupal application it's own drupal instance inside of a drupal website (nested drupals?) ? </p>

<p><strong>3 -</strong> Lastly, how do I handle databases? I understand Drupal and PHP are set to work best with MySQL. We have MS SQL databases that are used by multiple applications and would like to use them for new applications as we start using Drupal. For example, we have a Staff directory that feeds ASP.NET reporting application, ASP.NET Staff Listing application, and want to make a new Drupal PHP application that also uses (and perhaps inserts/updates more information into) that database. <strong>What is the best/easiest way to handle MS SQL databases and/or MySQL databases being used and updated by multiple Drupal and ASP.NET applications?</strong> Would it be easier to have all the applications use the MS SQL databases, or maybe to replicate the databases on MySQL for the Drupal/PHP apps and somehow sync the two databases?</p>

I'd always thought this would be a good idea, but the book has given me enough impetus to think about it seriously.</p>

<p>It also mentions (words to the effect of) ""learn object oriented design and you'll code pure C programs differently"".</p>

<p>I could go and (re)learn Java, but it seems perhaps an easy option given it's a language that follows a lot of the same principles as C#. I will probably still (re)learn Java at some point, but I'm quite interested first of all in what languages would be sufficiently different in their pattern of thinking that I would learn a different perspective - or just a whole different way of thinking about how to code a program.</p>

<p>(FYI -- I am working predominantly with the QT SDK and mingw32-make right now and I seem to have configured them correctly for my machine.)</p>

<p>I knew that there was a lot in the language which is compiler-driven -- I've heard about pre-compiler directives, but it seems like someone would be able to write books the different C++ compilers and their respective parameters.  In addition, there are commands which apparently precede make (like qmake, for example (is this something only in QT)).</p>

<p>I would like to know if there is any place which gives me an overview of what compilers are out there, and what their different options are.  I'd also like to know how each of them views Makefiles (it seems that there is a difference in syntax between them?).</p>

"1782607","<p>I need to design a new API which models networked devices which have a large amount of attributes which vary quite a lot based on the device's type. The attribute set is not totally arbitrary though, it is a big set of known attributes. That said, with new devices come new attributes so the situation is never totally fixed. </p>

<p>The network devices themselves come and go all the time so that's a central part of the API design. Also, it would be preferable to get updates on the attributes/attribute sets via some variant of the Observer pattern.</p>

<p><em>Note: I'm not talking about network management, although this might sound like that. That said, the APIs on those systems might very well be suitable/worth looking at.</em></p>

<p>So my question is, do you know any good APIs out there in the Open Source world from which I could learn and derive some inspiration from? </p>

"1782928","<p>I've been involved in several projects which basically involved replacing an ""old"" system with a ""new"" system.  Invariably, the pattern has been that practically no one on the team building the ""new"" system has any real knowledge of the ""old"" system.  Whenever I questioned this, I've been told that this is purposeful... by not knowing the ""old"" system, the team is able to think differently and not be limited by how things were done there.  So what happens is there is usually only 1 or 2 people on the team that know anything about the ""old"" system and they are consulted whenever a question comes up about how the ""old"" system did something.</p>

<p>But what always seems to happen is that after the ""new"" system is delivered, there are always questions from the user of the form ""How do we do X (which was easy in the old system) in the new system?""  For the developers, this is often the first time they have heard of X.  So they have to go and research what X is and often the answer they give back to the users is ""you can't"" or ""you can, but it's really awkward"".</p>

<p>This does not seem right to me... it seems to me that a lot would be gained by having every developer of the ""new"" system know the ""old"" system really well, and that wouldn't necessarily kill their creativity, if they have decent design and development skills.</p>

"1796481","<p>I'm a software developer interested in information retrieval. Currently I'm working on my 3rd search engine project and am <em>VERY</em> frustrated about the amount of boilerplate code that is written again and again, with the same bugs, etc.</p>

<p>Basic search engine is a very simple beast that could be described in a formal language consisting of two ""layers"":</p>

<ol>
<li><p>""Layer of primitives"" (or axioms, kernel language - don't know how to name them). They consist of several sets (as a set of resources - files, websites), relations on sets (as 'site A links to site B') and simple operations as 'open stream to resource A', 'read record from stream', 'merge N streams', 'index set of records by field F', etc. Also, there is a lot of data conversion, as 'save stream in YAML format', 'load stream from XML format', etc.</p></li>
<li><p>""Application layer"" - several very high-level operations that form a search engine lifecycle, as 'harvest new resources', 'crawl harvested resources', 'merge crawled resources to the database', 'index crawled resources', 'merge indexes', etc. Every one of this high-level operations could be expressed in the terms of ""primitives"" from 1.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Such a high-level representation could be easily tested, maybe even proved formally, and implemented (or code-generated) in the programming language of choice.</p>

<p>I'm currently working as a web developer and have knowledge of HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, JavaScript (mainly through <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery"" rel=""nofollow"">jQuery</a>) and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax%5F%28programming%29"" rel=""nofollow"">Ajax</a>.</p>

<p>My colleague has also used Perl to write a script to backup our MySQL databases every day and store them online.  He has moved on and I have been tasked to maintain the script. As such, I will need to learn Perl.</p>

"1836011","<p>It seems that many of the JavaScript questions are answered by the simple use of pushing a library, without taking into account the person asking the question. I think libraries are great myself, but sometimes I think that we're too quick to throw a library down someone's throat.</p>

<p>Imagine a person asks a question and it's apparent that they barely know JavaScript. They're just using code they found and piecing it together with other code, and really have no firm foundation to work on. To add a library on top of that flimsy foundation seems like a disaster waiting to happen.</p>

<p>With that in mind, what JavaScript / programming / web browser concepts do you think are necessary to understand <em>before</em> a library/framework is introduced to a person? Should a framework / library be part of the learning process?</p>

<p>I don't think someone has to grasp absolutely everything to use a library, I just think some people would be better served with a ""Library X might help solve your problems, but before you do that, you might want to read up on the following concepts"", rather than just a ""use library x"" answer. </p>

<p>My action is:</p>

<pre><code>public ActionResult Action(string text)
{
    ...
    return toInnocence;
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two distinct URL's that your action can map to:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>~/Controller/Action/textvalue</code> thanks to your route map {controller}/{action}/{text}</li>
<li><code>~/Controller/Action?text=textvalue</code> when submitted from a form</li>
</ol>

<p>My question is:</p>

<p>How can I differentiate between two forms and do a redirect in the latter case? The second form breaks RESTful principle. What's the best practice there? I don't want to query RouteData.Values collection because it breaks the whole purpose of mapping request parameters to function arguments in a natural, straightforward way. This is a very basic scenario I expect MVC to handle this nicely.</p>

<p>The second form doesn't map to ""text"" parameter in the controller action. Why? How can I create overloaded versions of the same action then? Do I have to create a new action and use it for form submissions? Of course I can workaround all these but at the same time I'm afraid of missing the big picture somewhere. </p>

<p>It looks like people are getting along with these at ease so I feel like I'm the only one who is confused by route values against query strings.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I looked at how Wikipedia does this. It uses separate actions for ""form getter"" and the actual restful URL and redirects from one to another as needed. I guess that would be the best way of doing it.</p>

<p>I've gone through archives of SO and found that there are ""ASP.NET Webforms"" (which seems to be the part of OFFICIAL Microsoft .NET) and something called ""ASP.NET MVC"" (which is not by Microsoft, some 3rd party library but very popular one). </p>

<p>So now, should I learn ""ASP.NET Webforms""  first and then should I go to ""ASP.NET MVC""? I'm confused with these two. </p>

<p>I found that the book ""Pro ASP.NET MVC Framework - Steven Sanderson"" is best book in the field. So, is it ok for me to jump into this and start reading?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>After reading the responses, I understood that ""ASP .NET MVC"" is more like WPF &amp; ""ASP.net web forms"" is like "".net winforms"" in desktop development. But why didn't Microsoft add ASP.NET MVC to .NET framework? like it added WPF even though Winforms existed in .NET fx stack. </p>

"2239782","<p>I've got some reasonable emacs-fu, and I know how to use the Flash Builder IDE to work in Flex/Actionscript, but I'd like to move to using Emacs to do most of my coding instead of the flash builder.  This poses some problems, though, namely that I'm not sure how to go about compiling my flex project from the fcsh-mode command line.</p>

<p>Here's an outline of my setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>My projects routinely depend on a combination of compiled third-party .swc files.</li>
<li>I use some internal libraries that I keep as Actionscript Library Projects in FB.</li>
<li>I occasionally recompile dependencies, but I can probably continue to do this in FB the rare time it's necessary.</li>
<li>Each Flex application project consists of a mix of MXML and ActionScript source.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've never used the command line compilers in this way, so I'm a bit stumped on how to start. I keep reading about <code>compile 1</code> when people talk about fcsh on the 'net, but that just gives me <code>fcsh: Target 1 not found</code> which I take to mean that I have to have run the 'right' compilation beforehand. But not a single web site touches on what exact mystical incantation that would be.</p>

<p>So, the basic question here is: What is the minimum complete set of steps starting with opening an actionscript or MXML file to a successful compilation of the file?</p>

"2287386","<p>Some time ago I've started with PowerShell that is really great. I can code almost everyting I know, I can use .NET framework, WMI, even WIN API. Features like piping help me a lot to write manageable and readable code. V2 added advanced functions, modules, background jobs, remoting (woow) etc.</p>

<p>As I said, I can do almost everything with PowerShell, but I'd like to learn a new language. The main reason is further self-education. Other reasons (not so important):</p>

<ul>
<li>some limitations (e.g. it's not easy to work with threads in PowerShell or generics support)</li>
<li>speed (it's probably costs of wrapping all to PSObjects and not working with objects directly)</li>
<li>cross-platform development (e.g. I can run Python on my Symbian, which probably won't be possible with PowerShell)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What language would you recommend me that can beat PowerShell in some areas?</strong> For example in readability, language consistency, documentation, usefullness, libraries, stability, WTF moments... <br/>
If it is able to deal with the limitations I pointed out, the better.</p>

<p>I prefer scripting language because of the REPL loop and because it's not too verbose as e.g. C#, but that's not a requirement.</p>

<p>I've had a quick look at IronPython. The main reason was hosting as presented at <a href=""http://microsoftpdc.com/Sessions/FT30"" rel=""nofollow"">PDC 2009</a>. However, I miss piping, it's too verbose and somewhat clumsy compared to PowerShell.</p>

<hr>

<p>My background: I've worked (at least as a beginner) with these languages: with c#, c++, javascript, tsql. I had a quick look at python, but that didn't convince me to give it a try (maybe a mistake).</p>

"2328230","<p>I'm a relatively new hire, and I'm starting on a small, fairly simple project. The language that this project will be implemented in is still to be determined. The question basically boils down to - Java or Python? </p>

<p>Here's the dilemma: My manager would prefer it to be done in Python. I don't object to that, but I have no experience in Python. I'd really love to learn Python and think I could manage it fairly quickly (especially as it's a small project). BUT the project is due at the end of March and must be ready by then. So they'd rather have it in Java and on time than in Python and late, and they don't want to pressure me to do it in Python if I think I can't make it on time.</p>

<p>Sorry about the background - but my question basically is, how long does it take, on average, to adapt to a new language? I know this is subjective and personalized, and depends on how fast the particular programmer is... but talking about an average programmer, or even a somewhat fast one that picks up things quickly, what percentage of an increase does programming in a non-native language (but with similar concepts) cause? As in, if this project would take me about 2 weeks in Java or a .NET language, how much longer can it take me in Python? Can I assume that having double the amount of time (i.e. a new, unfamiliar language causes a 50% increase in programming time) is adequate?</p>

<p>And included in this question - from what I've heard, it seems to be pretty easy/intuitive to switch over from Java to Python. Is this true...?</p>

<p><strong>Thanks</strong> everyone for all the answers! I didn't realize there are so many sides to this question... I will try to choose an answer soon - each response made me look at it a different way and it's hard to choose one answer.</p>

We're primarily building apps in ASP.Net, and do so in a very 2003-ish way.  It's like going back in a time machine.  Although two of the other developers are amenable to learning new things, one of the developers is not.

He also doesn't recognize agile development, TDD, or basically any non-Microsoft-blessed tool or method. He even considers source control from anything other than SourceSafe to be dangerous.  To his credit, he's a brilliant <i>programmer</i>, just not someone interested in <i>software development</i>. </p>

<li>Has a introduction for programmers for GUI (what are the differences from a script, examples of some simple interfaces)</li>
<li>A framework that would allow me to run my programs on the platforms I use most (Windows) but that can also run on Mac and maybe Linux, without too much modification.</li>
<li>Very shallow learning curve (easy to make first interfaces) but flexibility later on to customize the interface beyond what the typical OS allows (different colors, size and shapes of buttons, for example)</li>

<p>@Edit: I know the basics of JSP/Servlets (read Head First JSP&amp;Servlets) but I made only 1 project so far (a semi-decent hangman with JSP/Serlvets and JPA for persistance) that's about it. Flex - I'm just starting, I know really the basics of mxml and as3.</p>

<p>As for why: 1) because we need to do a project for the uni and well I was thinking bout becoming a web dev (yup - Java EE+flex) after graduation, this is the perfect opportunity to learn them.</p>

"2402989","<p>How do I get started designing and implementing a script interface for my .NET application?</p>

<p>There is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Studio_Tools_for_Applications""><code>VSTA</code></a> (the .NET equivalent of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications""><code>VBA</code></a> for <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model""><code>COM</code></a>), but as far as I understand I would have to pay a license fee for every installation of my application. It is an open source
application so this will not work.</p>

<p>There is also e.g. the embedding of interpreters (IronPython?), but I don't understand how this would allow exposing an ""object model"" (see below) to external (or internal) scripts.</p>

<p>Sub-questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the scripting interface story in .NET? Is it somehow trivial to do this in .NET? </li>
<li>E.g. can some .NET objects in my application and their contained objects be declared to be accessible from the outside at runtime?</li>
<li>How can <strong><em>external</em></strong> scripts access my application (through the object model)?</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p>Background:</p>

<p>I have once designed and implemented a fairly involved script interface for a Macintosh application for acquisition and analysis of data from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry#Time-of-flight"">a mass spectrometer</a> (Mac OS, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7"">System 7</a>) and later a COM interface for a Windows application. </p>

<p>Both were designed with an ""object model"" and classes (that can have properties). These are overloaded words, but
in a scripting interface context object model is essentially a containment hiarchy of 
objects of specific classes. Classes have properties, lists of contained objects and is not only data but can have verbs as well (actions/methods). E.g. in the Macintosh case the defined 
application object can contain an acquisition object that have properties for voltages used in the instrument and a <code>fireLater</code> verb - all as seen from the external script.</p>

<p>Note that in both cases the classes/objects in the programming language used to implement the application had nothing to do with the scripting object model. For the Macintosh case the mechanisms used to implement the scripting interface was defined by Apple. There were also some standards defined by Apple on how to design the object model. For instance standardised names for certain common properties in classes.</p>

<p>Or like in the COM interfaces exposed in Microsoft Office applications, where the application object can be used to add to its list of documents (with the side effect of creating the GUI representation of a document).</p>

<p>External scripts can create new objects in a container and navigate through the content of the hiarchy at any given time. In the Macintosh case scripts could be written in e.g. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript"">AppleScript</a> or <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UserLand_Software#Frontier"">Frontier</a>.</p>

<p>On the Macintosh the implementation of a scripting interface was very complicated. 
Support for it in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metrowerks"">Metroworks</a>' C++ class library (the name escapes me right now) made it much simpler.</p>

"2423469","<p>I came from a C, php and bash background, it was easy to learn because they all have the same C structure, which I can associate with what I already know.</p>

<p>Then 2 years ago I learned Python and I learned it quite well, Python is easier for me to learn than Ruby. Then since last year, I was trying to learn Ruby, then Rails, and I admit, until now I still couldn't get it, the irony is that those are branded as easy to learn, but for a seasoned programmer like me, I just couldn't associate it with what I learned before, I have 2 books on both Ruby and Rails, and when I'm reading it nothing is absorbed into my mind, and I'm close to giving up...</p>

<p>In ruby, I'm having a hard time grasping the concepts of blocks, and why there's @variables that can be accessed by other functions, and what does $variable and :variable do? And in Rails, why there's function like this_is_another_function_that_do_this, so thus ruby, is it just a naming convention or it's auto-generated with thisvariable _can_do_this_function. I'm still puzzled that where all those magic concepts and things came from? And now, 1 year of trying and absorbing, but still no progress...</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong>
To summarize:</p>

<ol>
<li>How can I learn about blocks, and how can it be related to concepts from PHP/C?</li>
<li>Variables, what does does it mean when a variable is prefixed with:
<ul>
<li>@</li>
<li>$</li>
<li>:</li>
</ul></li>
<li>""Magic concepts"", suchs as rails declarations of Records, what happens behind the scenes when I write <code>has_one X</code></li>
</ol>

<p>OK so, bear with me with my confusion, at least I'm honest with myself, and it's over a year now since I first trying to learn ruby, and I'm not getting younger..</p>

<p>so </p>

<pre><code>I learned this in Bash/C/PHP

solve_problem($problem)
{
  if [ -e $problem == ""trivial"" ];
    then
      write_solution();
    else
      breakdown_problem_into_N_subproblems(\;
      define_relationship_between_subproblems;
      for i in $( command $each_subproblem );
        do
          solve_problem $i
        done
  fi
}

write_solution(problem) {
  some_solution=$(command &lt;parameters&gt; ""input"" | command);
  command | command $some_solution &gt; output_solved_problem_to_file
}

breakdown_problem_into_N_subproblems($problems) {
  for i in $problems;
    do
      command $i | command &gt; i_can_output_a_file_right_away
    done
}

define_relationship_between_subproblems($problems) {
  if [ -e $problem == ""relationship"" ];
    then
      relationship=$(command; command | command; command;)
    elsif [ -e $problem == ""another_relationship"" ];  
      relationship=$(command; command | command; command;)
  fi
}


In C/PHP is something like this

solve_problem(problem)
{
  if (problem == trivial) write_solution;
    else {
      breakdown_problem_into_N_subproblems;
      define_relationship_between_subproblems;
      for (each_subproblem) solve_problems(subproblem);
    }

<ul>
<li>The need to make an additional layer.
It's more work, but it forces you
explicitly specify contract between
GUI and processing data. The border between GUI and algorithms becomes very clear.</li>
<li>It's more popular among employers. At least, in Russia where we live. It's rather common to write performance-critical algorithms in C++ and PInvoke them from well-looking C# application/ASP.Net website. Maybe it is not so widespread in the rest of the world but in Russia Windows is very popular, especially in companies and corporations due to some reasons, so most of b2b applications are Windows applications.</li>
<li>Rapid development. It's much quicker
to code in .Net then in C++ due to
many reasons.</li>

It's a fairly easy programming language considering that I learned Java in university, that I know php pretty well and that I already played around with python and ruby. The problem is that to properly learn a programming language I usually create a project. In javascript, I just don't know what kind of project I could create  - that is, a project that is not web-based or related to the web browser. Can I create javascript shell scripts? Where is javascript commonly used beside the web browsers?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To build [Cfront, the first C++

  ""C with Classes""-to-C preprocessor. ""C
  with Classes"" was a C dialect that
  became the immediate ancestor to C++...
  I then wrote the first version of
  Cfront in ""C with Classes"".</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I read this, it piqued my interest in the C preprocessor. I'd seen its macro capabilities as suitable for simplifying common expressions but hadn't thought about its ability to significantly add to syntax and semantics on the level that I imagine bringing classes to C took. </p>

<p>So now I have a couple of questions on my mind:</p>

<p>1) Are there other examples of this approach to bootstrapping a language off of C?</p>

<p>2) Is the source to Stroustrup's original work available anywhere?</p>

<p>3) Where could I learn more about the specifics of utilizing this technique? </p>

<p>4) What are the lengths/limits of that approach? Could one, say, create a set of preprocessor macros that let someone write in something significantly Lisp/Scheme like?</p>

"2792265","<p>Hey, I'm a relative newbie to programming. I've picked up some very basic Java (File I/O, GUIs, inheritance) and would like to take a look at functional programming - in particular, I would like to learn Scheme. I'm having some trouble finding a Scheme implementation I can understand. Interpreters are weird; I'm not sure how to save my programs and create executables. I've downloaded PLT Scheme, but I would prefer using something less condescending, something similar to NetBeans. Is there a plugin or tool that will allow me to quickly and easily create and manage Scheme programs? All help is appreciated!</p>

<p>And most articles I found was about test driven development, write tests first then write code to make the test pass. I'm not looking for that at the moment, I'm trying to write tests for already existing code with jMock. </p>

<p>The <a href=""http://www.jmock.org/getting-started.html"" rel=""nofollow"">official documentation</a> is vague to say the least and just too hard for me. Does anybody have better way to learn this. Good books/links/tutorials would help me a lot.  thank you</p>

<p><strong>EDIT - more concrete question :</strong></p>

<p><a href=""http://jeantessier.com/SoftwareEngineering/Mocking.html#jMock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jeantessier.com/SoftwareEngineering/Mocking.html#jMock</a> - from this article </p>

<p><em>Tried this to mock this simple class :</em></p>

    public class Cache {
        private Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; underlyingStorage;
        public Cache(Map&lt;Integer, String&gt; underlyingStorage) {
            this.underlyingStorage = underlyingStorage;
        }
        public String get(int key) {

        public void remove(int key) {
            underlyingStorage.remove(key);
        }
        public int size() {
            return underlyingStorage.size();
        }
        public void clear() {
            underlyingStorage.clear();
        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Here is how I tried to create a test/mock :</p>

<pre><code>public class CacheTest extends TestCase {

    private Mockery context;
    private Map mockMap;
    private Cache cache;

    @Override
    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        context = new Mockery() {
            {
                setImposteriser(ClassImposteriser.INSTANCE);
            }
        };

        mockMap = context.mock(Map.class);
        cache = new Cache(mockMap);
    }

    public void testCache() {
        context.checking(new Expectations() {{
            atLeast(1).of(mockMap).size(); 
            will(returnValue(int.class));
        }});

    }
}

<p>It passes the test and basically does nothing, what I wanted is to create a map and check its size, and you know work some variations try to get a grip on this. Understand better trough examples, what else could I test here or any other exercises would help me a lot. tnx</p>

"2908864","<p>A friend and I have been coming up with website ideas for a couple years, mostly just jotting them down whenever we come up with a good, useful idea when browsing the web.  For the past 6 months we've hired a couple different programmers to make a couple of the sites for us, but have been disappointed with how it's gone.  Been too slow and too many miscommunications for our liking.  So like the saying goes if you want something done right do it yourself, we're going to do it ourselves.</p>

<p>I know nothing about programming, I've never written a line of code in my life.  I consider myself very good with math and about as logical as you can get, but I have zero real-life programming knowledge.

<p>Is there a language you'd recommend learning first?  Something that is a good indicator how most other languages work?</p>

<p>What web programming languages do you recommend learning first based on popularity both now and the future.  I don't want to learn a language that's going to be outdated by the time I'm an expert at it.</p>

<p>Any specific books you'd recommend?</p>

<p>But IMO the best way to learn a new programming language—and more importantly, the idioms that come with it—is to read a good open source codebase written in that language. Naturally, <em>writing</em> code in that language is crucial, but in the beginning, you're basically struggling with your own ignorance about how things should be done. You could perform certain tasks one way or the other, but it takes experience to realize the flaws and virtues of each. Even after you've gotten a firm grasp of how things work, reading the code of people who have an even firmer one helps a great deal.</p>

<p>Most would agree that the most <em>insightful</em> parts of any learn-a-programming-language book are the code examples, and reading a well-written open source codebase is the next level of that.</p>

"2962908","<p>Ok here is my situation. I've studied Java in my college for 2 semesters. But you know they teach you jack in there, just the basics. We skipped half of our textbook and even then our professors don't teach from section to section of each chapter. I don't blame them. It's hard as it is for new students to understand even the basic concepts of programming. Now this is a <strong>community college</strong> we are talking about and not Stanford, MIT or Berkeley.</p>

<p>So like I said I've done 2 semester of Java. I really like our textbook because it has some challenging projects to do at the end of each chapter. This textbook is pretty clear and i have no problem understanding it (although 2-D and 3-D Arrays have given me some trouble). I have tried reading a few C# books such as Pro C# 2008 and .NET 3.5 and C# 4.0 in a  Nutshell. I found these books to be dry and overloaded with information that put me to sleep (No offense to the authors of those 2 wonderful, <em>according to amazon ratings</em>, books).</p>

<p>Would you suggest I finish my Java textbook, brush up my knowledge of Arrays, Polymorphism, and etc that are universal to most programming languages. And then switch to C#, plus the syntax is very similar so it should be easy to switch. Or should I just start learning C# right now from the very beginning? If it's the latter then could you recommend some free online resources that will keep me engaged and at the same time teach me everything I need to know about C#.</p>

<p>Someone has recommended me to learn .NET first, but I found it to be not the brightest idea. .NET is just a big monster full of libraries. How am I going to apply it if I don't even know the C# or VB!? Anyway back to my question: Master Java and switch to C# or just go with C#?</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER: I don't want to start .NET vs J2EE or C# vs Java flame war. I am going with C#. I've decided that I want to work in a Microsoft shop in the future. .NET is what I want to learn.</p>

"3026813","<p>Brief History: Just graduated high school, learned a bit of python and C++, have no friends with any helpful computer knowledge at all. Out of anyone i met in my school years I was probably the biggest nerd, but no one really knew. I consider my self to have a vast amount of knowledge on computers and tech then the average person. built/fixed tons of computers, and ability to troubleshoot pretty much any problem I came across. </p>

<p>Now that high school is over, Ive really been thinking about my career. Loving, living computers for the past 13 years of my life I decided to take my ability's and try to learn computer programming, why I didn't start earlier I don't know, seems to be big mistake on my part...</p>

<p>Doing some research I concluded that Python was the first programming language I should learn, since it was high level and easier to understand then C++ and Java. I also knew that to become good at what I did I needed to know more then just 2 or 3 languages, which didn't seem like a big problem considering once I learned the way Python worked, mainly syntax changed, and the rest would come naturally. I watched a couple of youtube videos, downloaded some book pdf's and snooped around from some tutorials here and there to get the hang of what to do.</p>

<p>A two solid weeks had passed of trying to understand the syntax, create small programs that used the basic functions and understanding how it worked, I think i have got the hang of it. It breaks down into what ive been dealing with all this time (although i kinda knew) is that, input,output, loops, functions and other things derived from 0's and 1's storing data and recalling it, ect. (A VERY BASIC IDEA). Ive been able to create small programs, Hangman, file storing, temperature conversion, Caeser Cipher decode/encoding, Fibonacci Sequence and more, which i can create and understand how each work.</p>

<p>Being 2 weeks into this, I have learned alot. Nothing at all compared to what i should be lear
ning in the years to come if i get a grip on what I'm doing. While doing these programs I wont stop untill I've done doing a practice problem on a book, which embarresing enough will take me a couple hour depending on the complexity of it. I absolutly will not put aside the challenge until its complete, WHICH CAN BE EXTREMELY DRAINING, ive tried most problems without cheating and reached success, which makes me feel extremely proud of my self after completing something after much trial and error.</p>

<p>After all this I have met the demon, alogrithm's which seem to be key to effiecent code. I cant seem to rap my head around some of the computer codes people put out there using numbers, and sometimes even basic functions, I have been able to understand them after a while but i know there are alot more complex things to come, considering my self smart, functions that require complex codes, actually hurt my brain. NOTHING EVER IN LIFE HURT MY BRAIN....... not even math classes in highschool, trying to understand some of the stuff people put out there makes me feel like i have a mental disadvantage lol... i still walk forward though, crossing my fingers that the understanding will come with time.</p>

<p>Sorry if is this is long i just wish someone takes all these things into consideration when answering my question. even through all these downsides im still pushing through and continuing to try and get good at this, i know reading these tutorials wont make me any good unless i can become creative and make my own, understand other peoples programs, so this leads me to the simple question i could have asked in the beginning.....</p>

<p>WHERE IN THE WORLD DO I START ?
Ive been trying to find out how to understand some of the open source projects, how i can work with experianced coders to learn from them and help them, but i dont think thats even possible by the way how far people's knowledge is compared to me, i have no freinds who i can learn from, can someone help me and guide me into the right direction.. i have a huge motivation to get good at coding, anything information would be extremely helpful</p>

Anyway heres my question, I did Java at university and I was always told I am a good programmer. However I never pursued it as a career - I went into support and management instead. Im pretty much bored with my job, I have therefore started to learn Objective C so that I can develop apps for the iphone. I am currently watching several different Videos / Books.</p>

<p>My problem is that when I go through the Apple documentation, although I understand most of it, sometimes I stumble. I believe that because you/we have the Apple documentation (i.e. Framework references) , everything should be clear, and therefore you should have no need to refer to a book or video (in order to learn how to use a particular class). But I alway do refer to a book and video and subsequently feel guilty as I believe the framework reference should be enough. (I therefore feel I am not up to being a programmer)</p>

<p>I also believe that you shouldn't need example code in order to learn how to use a particular class because Apple provides documentation for each class, but AGAIN I find my self googling example code and I find my answer like that - again I feel guilty for doing this.</p>

<p>Am I right in saying that Apple documentation is simply not clear? and that its ok to refer to a video/book or google? or forums for that matter?</p>

<p>I have proffesional programmers who tell me that I am worrying too much and that I should get on with it and use all the resources that I have. I just cant seem to get round this mental block that I have in my head.</p>

<p>When I start a programming project I am able to use the excellent search skills that I have to find the code I need, copy and paste it (yes I do understand it) BUT then I feel guilty telling myself that why didn't you think up the code yourself???? Therefore your not a real programmer, your just good at googling.</p>

<p>Currently I am going through 20+ books so that I can learn most of the frameworks, syntax etc to develop iphone apps. I believe if I do this, then when I think of a project I can make it quickly. Should I read a few books, like 2-3 and then just start a project /app , and if I get stuck just google it and get the code I need?</p>

<p>Can anybody please answer my questions?</p>

<p>Absolutely BRILLIANT answers and comments received from everyone. I am most grateful. </p>

<p>From now on I will use all the forums, books, documentation and example code I need without feeling guilty! As some people have said, Apple docs are not clear (and YES, I am very familiar with Objective C Syntax). I'll give you an example: In order to make the keyboard go away on the iphone, you have to use a method called <code>resignfirstresponder</code>. I learned how to use this method from a Video tutorial! </p>

<p>There is no way in hell that you can learn that from Apples docs, and sometimes not even from the best of books (the method is rather weird the way it works, the Apple docs are not clear). </p>

<p>Thats my gripe - Apple docs should be clear (at least with some example code). It seems people who are good programmers (but not good at googling) lose in this arena. And it seems not so good programmers can still get by - just by googling or watching a few videos (which a professional programmer does/cannot have access to for whatever reason). The whole affair seems rather unjust and imbalanced if you ask me.</p>

<p>Thanks for your replies people.</p>

"3078043","<p>I'm familiar with web programming, both client and server side, and I'd like to expand a bit my knowledge in order to be able to write some desktop programs.</p>

<p>My problem is that I'm not really familiar with the desktop way of managing widgets. As far as I understand, in a typical desktop programs, widgets have their own life, sending signals to each other and reacting to signals with callbacks. So every widget is an object with lots of methods. This adds a further complication with respect to what I know now, and I'm not sure I want to learn this at the moment.</p>

<p>On the web you tipically describe the elements on the page with a markup language, usually some version of HTML, and when an event is fired you modify the elements with Javascript. I'm trying to understand if there is a way to use the web paradigm in a desktop program. I'd like to be able to describe widgets via a markup language (these will be static) and alter them based on events. If I understand correctly, XUL based applications work this way.</p>

<p>The problem is that the documentation I can find about XUL seems a bit outdated. Is learning XUL a good idea? Can I expect to be still using it a few years from now? Or is it becoming already an old technology?</p>

<p>In case XUL is not a good idea, what are the alternatives? For the most simple applications, where the widgets static, or are only slightly modified, there are some <a href=""http://buc.billeragroup.net/"">easy</a> <a href=""http://autoglade.sourceforge.net/"">tools</a>, but what about a more complex program?</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Few times I heard people saying things like ""Every programmer should know Haskell"", ""You aren't a programmer if you don't know haskell"" and so on.
However, I'm not exactly sure if I should bother trying to get a brief understanding of that language or not. Playing around with interpreter (to get intuitive understanding of basics) will take at least few days (if not weeks), and I""m not exactly sure if the result will be worth it.</p>

<p>A bit of background (to get idea of my knowledge)<br>
I've started programming as a kid (somewhere between 10 or 13 years ago) with programmable calculator, moved to basic, then onto non-x86 assembly (reimlementing multiplication and division, and writing self-modifying mouse driver was fun), pascal, delphi, now I'm using C++ almost exclusively. Know my way around unix shell, can write software in python and probably in anything (if I have a reference book nearby) that remotely resembles C++ or Pascal (i.e. blocks, similar flow control, etc). Specialization is 3D programming and shaders. ""Fish in the water"" with low-level operations (C-style memory allocation, pointers), less comfortable with extremely OOP approach (i.e. when classes are made for the sake of having classes). Almost completely self-taught. I.e. definitely not a newbie, but there are areas where I could improve.</p>

<p>So... what could I possibly gain from studying Haskell at this point? As far as I know, this language is not really widely used, as a result there probably is less libraries it can interface with (as it was with Delphi programming - you can do DirectX programming in delphi, if you really want, but you can't write 3dsmax/maya plugin with it (well, it is probably theoretically possible, but it certainly won't be easy)). I also don't think that I'll be easily able to plug a piece of Haskell code into game engine. </p>

<p>So, what kind of useful knowledge I can get from it?</p>

<p>P.S. I won't buy ""if you learn another language, you'll probably learn something that will be probably useful"" argument.</p>

"3195458","<p>I've taken a course in C++ in my freshman year in undergrad. However once it was over I never employed it in any project or use. I am familiar with some average topics in C++ prior to where 'link list' starts. Once I got the opportunity to do my first project after Sophomore year, I was suggested by my prof. to learn Matlab which is widely used in mathematical and engineering projects. Now I am pretty comfortable with using Matlab for my research. But I often hear from people that Matlab is not a language and that it can't take the place of any programming languages like C++, Java, Fortran etc. I am also concerned that Matlab is hardly used in industry (any!) because of its costs and its inability to run using executable files unlike Fortran, C++ etc.</p>

<p>I am wanting to learn a programming language:</p>

<p>1) Which takes care of the above, and other, issues which Matlab lacks in many aspects. </p>

<p>2) Which is widely used and available in industry and research centers.</p>

<p>3) Which is relatively easy and quick to code, and powerful in its capabilities.</p>

<p>Also please:</p>

<p>1) Give the advantages and disadvantages (over Matlab) for the language you suggest. </p>

<p>2) The best way to learn it.</p>

<p>3) The proper sequence of topics to learn knowing that I am familiar with the programming concepts.</p>

<p>4) A source, which is easy, good and interesting, to learn from.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> My area is not software development or computer engineering. My purpose of learning a new language is based on engineering and mathematical projects.

"3208168","<p>So a couple years back I took some time to grok <code>make</code>, and it's paid off enormously.  Writing little makefiles for building my projects and automating tasks is fun and productive.</p>

<p>The downside is, of course, that my makefiles are overspecific, especially when it comes to platforms and library locations.</p>

<p>So this is the point at which people tell me ""autotools to the rescue!""  And they certainly seem to do the trick when other people do them (I love downloading something and running <code>configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; sudo make install</code> and watching it just work), but I can't wrap my head around them.</p>

<p>I've looked in some <code>configure.ac</code> and <code>Makefile.am</code> files, and I just don't understand what's going on.

If you are a Technical Manager, you SHOULD invest in retraining your key staff in multi-threaded programming.

<p>I reject the idea that one cannot learn parallel programming ""right"" on their own. So what's the most responsible way to teach oneself parallel programming? What books and other resources are recommended?</p>

<p>Edit: Here are some more details. I would be mostly applying these to scientific computing, but I was looking for general, language-agnostic material/advice. I am also looking for a heathy dose of practical theory. Imagine you have an excellent developer who loves math and computer science, but never took a course on parallel programming. Now imagine he has a deadline for a problem (say 1 year), and you have to give him the materials to figure out whether parallelization would be helpful, and how to implement it right. What resources would you give him? That is how I (and I hope other developers) would be interested in learning parallelization/multi-threading. </p>

<p>What I don't feel like I know are some practical projects I can work on to help me learn how the language is used. There's a lot of examples in the books I'm reading, and they're absolutely useful as far as reinforcing knowledge gained about the language itself.

I know obviously I'm not going to become an expert right away and start doing amazing things. I just want some ideas for things I can do to help me become better but that feel like more than just exercises.

I just think I'd get more excited about learning if I was doing something that seemed more practical in nature.)</p>

"3645333","<p>Yes, I <em>am</em> using a profiler (ANTS). But at the micro-level it cannot tell you how to fix your problem. And I'm at a microoptimization stage right now. For example, I was profiling this:</p>

<pre><code>for (int x = 0; x &lt; Width; x++)
{
    for (int y = 0; y &lt; Height; y++)
    {
        packedCells.Add(Data[x, y].HasCar);
        packedCells.Add(Data[x, y].RoadState);
        packedCells.Add(Data[x, y].Population);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>ANTS showed that the y-loop-line was taking a lot of time. I thought it was because it has to constantly call the Height getter. So I created a local <code>int height = Height;</code> before the loops, and made the inner loop check for <code>y &lt; height</code>. That actually made the performance worse! ANTS now told me the x-loop-line was a problem. Huh? That's supposed to be insignificant, it's the outer loop!</p>

<p>Eventually I had a revelation - maybe using a property for the outer-loop-bound and a local for the inner-loop-bound made CLR jump often between a ""locals"" cache and a ""this-pointer"" cache (I'm used to thinking in terms of CPU cache). So I made a local for Width as well, and that fixed it.</p>

<p>From there, it was clear that I should make a local for Data as well - even though Data was not even a <em>property</em> (it was a field). And indeed that bought me some more performance.</p>

<p>Bafflingly, though, reordering the x and y loops (to improve cache usage) made zero difference, even though the array is huge (3000x3000).</p>

<p>I am having trouble to just do certain things.  For example. make a UserControl to be used by a central control that also controls another UserControl while having a database layer.</p>

<p>I would really like to learn how to structure logically programs and what best design is (for example, I hate having a program filled with if/else statements)  The problem is, the books I find only have basic examples that don't really deepen my overall undestanding of how all the pieces need to work together.</p>

"3684105","<p>I was wondering is learning Python and Django a hard/time consuming process for someone who's already rather familiar with OO programming (C++/Java) and some web dev (Java EE)?</p>

<p>I'm starting to look for a technology to implement a part of my master's thesis and since it will be a web app I'm considering Java EE (since I'm already familiar with it), Python/Django (since my professor suggested it and I'd really like to learn Python), Ruby on Rails (also my profs suggestion but somehow I don't feel like learning it) and PHP (the last suggestion but I despise PHP). Oh he also said he heard something about Scala, but from what I know Scala/Lift isn't all that mainstream yet and it might be problematic to work with it?</p>

<p>My greatest concern is time since for the next 4-5months I'll be attending my normal courses, go to work and work on my thesis (then I'll have 4-5months for only work+my thesis) and I'm not sure will I find the time to learn a new language.</p>

"3770774","<p>As my first programming language, I decided to learn Haskell. I'm an analytic philosophy major, and Haskell allowed me to quickly and correctly create programs of interest, for instance, transducers for natural language parsing, theorem provers, and interpreters. Although I've only been programming for two and a half months, I found Haskell's semantics and syntax much easier to learn than more traditional imperative languages, and feel comfortable (now) with the majority of its constructs.</p>

<p>Programming in Haskell is like sorcery, however, and I would like to broaden my knowledge of programming. I would like to choose a new programming language to learn, but I do not have enough time to pick up an arbitrary language, drop it, and repeat. So I thought I would pose the question here, along with several stipulations about the type of language I am looking for. Some are subjective, some are intended to ease the transition from Haskell.</p>

<ul>
<li>Strong type system. One of my favorite parts of programming in Haskell is writing type declarations. This helps structure my thoughts about individual functions and their relationship to the program as a whole. It also makes informally reasoning about the correctness of my program easier. I'm concerned with correctness, not efficiency.</li>
<li>Emphasis on recursion rather than iteration. I use iterative constructs in Haskell, but implement them recursively. However, it is much easier to understand the structure of a recursive function than a complicated iterative procedure, especially when using combinators and higher-order functions like maps, folds and bind.</li>
<li>Rewarding to learn. Haskell is a <em>rewarding</em> language to work in. It's a little like reading Kant. My experience several years ago with C, however, was not. I'm not looking for C. The language should enforce a conceptually interesting paradigm, which in my entirely subjective opinion, the C-likes do not.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Weighing the answers</strong>: These are just notes, of course. I'd just like to reply to everyone who gave well-formed responses. You have been very helpful.</p>

<p>1) Several responses indicated that a strong, statically typed language emphasizing recursion means another functional language. While I want to continue working strongly with Haskell, camccann and larsmans correctly pointed out that another such language would ""ease the transition too much."" These comments have been very helpful, because I am not looking to write Haskell in Caml! Of the proof assistants, Coq and Agda both look interesting. In particular, Coq would provide a solid introduction to constructive logic and formal type theory. I've spent a little time with first-order predicate and modal logic (Mendellsohn, Enderton, some of Hinman), so I would probably have a lot of fun with Coq.</p>

<p>2) Others heavily favored Lisp (Common Lisp, Scheme and Clojure). From what I gather, both Common Lisp and Scheme have excellent introductory material (<em>On Lisp</em> and <em>The Reasoned Schemer</em>, <em>SICP</em>). The material in <em>SICP</em> causes me to lean towards Scheme. In particular, Scheme through <em>SICP</em> would cover a different evaluation strategy, the implementation of laziness, and a chance to focus on topics like continuations, interpreters, symbolic computation, and so on. Finally, as others have pointed out, Lisp's treatment of code/data would be entirely new. Hence, I am leaning heavily towards option (2), a Lisp.</p>

<p>3) Third, Prolog. Prolog has a wealth of interesting material, and its <em>primary</em> domain is exactly the one I'm interested in. It has a simple syntax and is easy to read. I can't comment more at the moment, but after reading an overview of Prolog and skimming some introductory material, it ranks with (2). And it seems like Prolog's backtracking is always being hacked into Haskell! </p>

<p>4) Of the mainstream languages, Python looks the most interesting. Tim Yates makes the languages sound very appealing. Apparently, Python is often taught to first-year CS majors; so it's either conceptually rich or easy to learn. I'd have to do more research.</p>

<p>Thank you all for your recommendations! It looks like a Lisp (Scheme, Clojure), Prolog, or a proof assistant like Coq or Agda are the main langauages being recommended.</p>

"3834875","<p>I installed WiX 3.5 with Visual Studio 2010, as I've read lots of people saying that WiX is a great alternative to that hellhole that is the Visual Studio Setup project, but it sure seems like it requires a lot more effort to make even the simplest installer.  Am I missing something?  </p>

<p>In a VS setup project, I can add a project output to my ProgramFilesFolder, and VS automatically sweeps up all the dependent dll's from the other projects in the solution, as well as 3rd-party libraries and such.  After reading <a href=""http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix3/authoring_first_votive_project.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> from the (apparently somewhat out of date) online docs, I thought maybe WiX finally had something similar, but it doesn't actually pull in dependent libraries--it just makes it easier to add that single project's output to a fragment without a lot of extra typing.</p>

<p>So the best I can see to do is manually add to my WiX setup project every single project in my solution that I want in the installer (and set Harvest to true, since that doesn't seem to be the default).  I'd probably write a little perl script to do that.  Then I have to determine all the non-project dependent dll's somehow (probably easiest to look at the VS setup project for that) and add by hand some wxs code to include them (since apparently the WiX project only handles references to projects, not raw dll's).  Then edit in a simple UI, for which there are samples on the web I can work from.  And code for shortcuts.</p>

I know that communities hate n00b questions but can you point me to some n00b xInput programming tutorials that include gestures.

<p>But at the begining i'd like to know which technologies should i use. Now i'm ASP.NET (MVC2) + WPF and a bit Silverlight programmer and after about 3 months, while i's developing asp.mvc website, i've learnt many interesting things about building modular and extensible applications (MEF and Prism), about architecture (DI, IoC frameworks (ninject, Castle WIndsor, StructMap), EntityFramework as ORM, NHibernate)... I wish i'd know them all before i've started my adventure with .NET, now my website would be quite different :)</p>

<p>So here i'd like to ask You- advanced java/Flex programmers what should i know if i want to start develope really good, enterprise and flexible application...</p>

<p>Right now i've read some informations about Hibernate as ORM, Java Spring as web framework, BlazeDs to connect spring and Flex, and... I have no idea how good programmers cope with IoC Containers in Java/Flex world. Are there any frameworks? Something like mentioned above Ninject, Castle Windsor etc?</p>

<p>Where should i start if i'd like to build extensible applications. Divided on modules which can be developed by separated programmers' groups. Is there something like MEF or Prism for Java? Or mayby there are some other, better ways. I read something about OSGi (used in Eclipse) but i don't know is it a good way to create extensible application?</p>

For example, I started the rails sever using the <code>:&gt; rails server -d</code> command and I couldn't figure out how to stop it.  Ctrl-c, as mentioned in the tutorials, didn't work since it was a detached process using the -d switch.  After searching google, I found the <code>lsof|grep ruby</code> helped me locate the running process and <code>kill -9 pid</code> stopped it.  I've spent the last twelve years developing on Windows and I've never used or seen any of these linux commands before. It makes me nervous attempting to develop is such an unfamiliar environment.

My assumptions are to copy VsPerfCLREnv and VsPerfCmd to the server that hosts my wcf service and perform some configuraiton steps that I'm not quite sure on. I'm also not quite sure how I would be able to see the call stack to evaluate the performance of each call.</p>

<p>clrprofiler seems a bit simpler. I assume I would copy clrprofiler.exe to the server, <code>File-&gt;Profile Service</code> and add the name and start/stop commands. (is this a friendly name or filename or the service display name?) I assume I would then run my tests against the service and I could see the call stack in clrprofiler. Does that sound correct?</p>

I'm not so interested in testing the network since this is on a test server, and this is a large wcf project with multiple devs on it and I am unable to make changes to the project for the sole purpose of monitoring the performance.

"4081942","<p>I understand that apple no longer allows me to send ""device data"" to third-party services. As a result of this, Flurry and presumably every other analytics company no longer collects OS/hardware version data. However, this data is very valuable to anyone trying to target development toward the people who are actually using the apps.</p>

<p>I can imagine a few different ways to collect this data.</p>

<p>1) Send a custom event indicating the hardware/os version to Flurry. This, of course, is in direct violation of the agreement with Apple. However, I suspect plenty of people are doing this, and just not getting busted. Still, not an ideal solution. Even if Apple didn't notice that we were sending this data, I'd rather not have the possibility of the app getting pulled hanging over my head.</p>

<p>2) Use an analytics package which allows me to collect data on my own server. Localytics is one company which seems to offer this. However, I don't think they offer this with their free plan. Is anyone aware of any free (or cheap) analytics tools which will allow me to send data to my own server?</p>

<p>3) Roll my own solution. This could either be an entire replacement for Flurry, or I could continue to use flurry, but send only the device data to my own server. This is a little clunky. I'd much rather have all my analytics data in one place. And would much rather not have to deal with building my own tool if I don't have to</p>

<p>So, is anyone else collecting device data? Are you using one of the above techniques? Or maybe something different I hadn't thought of?</p>

"4328271","<p>This might be one of those questions that are difficult to answer, but here goes:</p>

<p>I don't consider my self programmer - but I would like to :-) I've learned R, because I was sick and tired of spss, and because a friend introduced me to the language - so I am not a complete stranger to programming logic. </p>

<p>Now I would like to learn python - primarily to do screen scraping and text analysis, but also for writing webapps with Pylons or Django.</p>

<p>So: How should I go about learning to screen scrape with python? I started going through the <a href=""http://doc.scrapy.org/"">scrappy docs</a> but I feel to much ""magic"" is going on - after all - I am trying to learn, not just do.</p>

<p>On the other hand: There is no reason to reinvent the wheel, and if Scrapy is to screen scraping what Django is to webpages, then It might after all be worth jumping straight into Scrapy. What do you think?</p>

<p>Oh - BTW: The kind of screen scraping: I want to scrape newspaper sites (i.e. fairly complex and big) for mentions of politicians etc. - That means I will need to scrape daily, incrementally and recursively - and I need to log the results into a database of sorts - which lead me to a bonus question: Everybody is talking about nonSQL DB. Should I learn to use e.g. mongoDB right away (I don't think I need strong consistency), or is that foolish for what I want to do?</p>

Like either the regular expression will always match more words if it should match an infinite amounts of words and I only give it a finite number of words. Or I will need some more compact representation of the input. Or I am also thinking about giving me some regular expression as input and a list of additional words and I want to get a regular expression which matches all of them together (and maybe more).

<p>Hello,
I am a junior .NET/C# developer and wanted to gauge how fellow developers learned .NET. I've been learning ASP.NET but am having some trouble remembering the members of the .NET library. So for example, I'm doing a training on ASP.NET and we do an example in the System.IO namespace then we jump to something in System.Collections. I know everything is supposed to tie together but we are zipping through it so fast that if I want to use it tomorrow I would still struggle. So any suggestions on how to best learn in a manner that will be more real world and practical? I was thinking about studying each Namespace by itself...so one week do System.IO, the next week System.Collections and so on. Just so I can see a relationship between items. Thanks.</p>

"4742565","<p>I'm accustomed to writing desktop applications in C#.NET. Where I have a nice little solution folder which is also under version control. So at any time, on any computer I can check out whatever version of my software I want run the compiler and have a working copy of my program.</p>

<p>Now I'm looking into developing websites, where the files and data are a lot more dispersed. I'm using ASP.NET, but really my question is more general and could apply to any website framework. </p>

<p>I'm trying to understand the proper work-flow between developing my website, a version control server, and the actual live website that users will see. Obviously this can vary a lot depending on the type and scale of the website, but I'm only considering a pretty simple site. I'm just getting started with this stuff.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows my current idea. All the source files for the site would be stored on a subversion server, which I would check out onto my local computer. My local computer would have a local database which I would use for development of the site. Next I would publish to a test version on my hosted server, which would point to a separate test database. This test database may periodically be replaced by a copy of the live database. </p>

<p>If all goes well I would then publish to a beta version of the site which points to the live data. Users could then check out the beta version to provide feedback. Finally if there are still no problems the source files for the live site would be updated.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/8mFEH.jpg"" alt=""alt text""></p>

<p>Does this make sense? Does anyone have any comments on how this could be improved? Are there any good books or online tutorials available on developing these kind of workflows? </p>

<p>Also the one thing that I'm really not sure about is how to manage changes to the actual schema of the database. I figure with each version I could generate a SQL script that can be use to update the Test and Live databases on the host. However, I'd also like to be able to easily setup a new database for any version of my site with out having to run every update SQL script for every version up to the desired version. Is the best solution to use an ORM like NHibernate or Subsonic so I could always generate my database schema directly from my code? </p>

<p>The question is not how to do that but <strong>which methods of MonoTouch are involved</strong>? My guess would be to override <strong>LayoutSubViews()</strong> and in there implement my logic to align the controls - is that correct? Do I have to call base.LayoutSubViews()?
Do I have to override anything else? It should of course realign as buttons get removed or added and also if the view itself changes in size.
Do I have to touch <strong>SizeToFit()</strong>, too?</p>

I'm starting to feel like I have no idea what I'm doing, and I really don't get any of the concepts like movie clips and the stage and so forth.

<p>void setup()
{
size( 400, 400 );
}</p>

<p>void draw()

for( int i = 0; i &lt; ballArray.length; i++ )
{
ballArray[ i ].display(); //Run each ball's display code every time step

{
PVector location; //Vector to store this ball's location in
Ball( int x, int y )
{
location = new PVector( x, y );
ballArray = ( Ball[] ) append( ballArray, this ); //Add this ball to the array

void display()
{

ellipse( location.x, location.y ); //Display this ball at its location
}
}</p>

"4999195","<p>Hi I have been playing around with MDX and need some very high-level getting-started type guidance. I already have a SQL-Server 2008 R2 DB up and running with data in it. I want to try something very simple in MDX to get familiar with the flow. I am not a DW or Cube expert so I need to start slow. (Facts/Dimenions are new to me)</p>

<p>I have a view from my relational DB that I wish to use as the single source for MDX. It's simple:</p>

<pre><code>TABLE WEEKLY_GAIN
  PCTGAIN (DECIMAL) -- The pre-calc'd pctg gain in price from day x to day x+1  
  DATE (DATE)       -- The date the stock pctgain was generated  
  WEEK(INT)         -- Contiguous/Consecutive integer that is keyed to the last trading day of each week.  
  YEAR (INT)        -- The year of the current PCTGAIN from the DATE column
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Sample Data:</strong>   </p>

<pre><code>PCTGAIN          DATE           WEEK   YEAR  
0.01709791       2011-01-14     2      2011  
0.01102063       2011-01-07     1      2011  
0.0006922469     2010-12-31     52     2010  
0.01033836       2010-12-23     51     2010
</code></pre>

<p>I would like to use MDX to generate a cube and some functions (MEDIAN, MEAN, STDEV, etc). I have successfully identified the above view as a source in MDX. However I need help defining the (MDX) dimenions, keys, cube definitions, and whatever else needs to be done, etc.</p>

<p>I believe this should be straight forward (the date, WEEK, YEAR would be dimensions?) but I am not sure.</p>

<p>One ""Cube"" I would like to generate is...All of the years (1950-2011) are rows, all of the weeks (1-52) are columns and then generate some MIN, MAX, MED, aggregates of PCTGAIN for each week number across all years. I recognize there are ways to do this with T-SQL. However, I wish to do this in MDX to get the hang of setting MDX up and becoming productive with it.</p>

"5059317","<p>So here's the story: I currently work as a C# developer doing ASP.NET.  While I like C# I don't like the overall quality of the .NET community; most of my past experiences have been that many .NET developers are totally ignorant of actual software engineering (e.g. design patterns, code separation, etc.).  The Java area seems a lot better in this regard even if you do have to put up with the occasional ""architecture astronaut"".</p>

<p>My actual question is this: I can pick up the Java syntax easy enough since I already know C#.  However, I've only worked with the full Microsoft stack for web development (WebForms, although I've looked a bit at MVC and I've done some Ruby on Rails demo stuff so I know MVC fairly well).  If I want to learn enough marketable skills to be able to apply for junior-level Java development positions at companies, what stack should I look at? There are dozens of Java web frameworks out there; what would be the most common one used in companies?  It seems that Hibernate is the default standard for persistence (I've done a little bit with NHibernate) so I'm okay with that.  I've also seen several new Java web frameworks that seem interesting, but learning them won't give me a leg up in applying for a job at a company because I'm bettering they're untested in the corporate world and aimed at startups and similar like most new frameworks.</p>

<p>Which framework would be the most likely to be used at a typical company that I should start to learn in order to begin a transition to a better quality community?</p>

<p>However, there is something I am missing. I need instruction a step back from anything I have seen in those projects. They assume some basic knowledge that I apparently don't have, and I am unable to deduce what each line of code in the examples is actually doing.</p>

<p>I want to do four things:</p>

<p>1) Make the forward button work like it does in a non-AJAX app.<br />
2) Make the backward button work like it does in a non-AJAX app.<br />
3) Reflect the url in the address bar so that it can be bookmarked.<br />
4) Generate deep links so that the AJAX stuff can be crawled.<br /></p>

<p>And that is all. Anything else is overkill. This is a Rails 3.0.4 application, and I have links that all have an href of ""#"". Clicking on one of the links activates a function from application.js that replaces the html in a div on the current page with more links created from a partial that is rendered from a .js.erb file.</p>

<p>I have a breadcrumb trail that works just fine, but using the back button will take you to whatever website you were looking at before you looked at the application.</p>

<p>So some of my questions are:</p>

<p>1) Do each of my links need a unique href value instead of a simple ""#""?<br />
2) Should I be replacing that div each time, or simply hiding it and creating a new one. If so, should each new div have a new id?<br />
3) Since currently the url in the address bar doesn't change, and these AJAX requests are all POSTS, do I have to do anything in Rails to make it respond to one of these new URLs which will invariably trigger a GET request when accessed via browser history or back button?<br /></p>

<p>These are the barriers that are keeping me from running with the existing questions out there. Thanks a lot for any help you can offer!</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>My application is not tab based. Not all the anchors are available when the page loads. Here is what happens when a user clicks a link:</p>

<p>1) A field in a hidden form is filled in with the text value of the link that was clicked.<br /></p>

<p>2) The hidden form is serialized and delivered to a controller action with POST.<br /></p>

<p>3) The controller action determines who made the request, figures out what data they have access to, and uses the form values (now params) to retrieve a list of objects.<br /></p>

<p>4) Those objects are passed to a .js.erb view template that in turn render a partial with the values that were passed.<br /></p>

<p>5) The new links are rebound via js in the .js.erb template.</p>

<p>Basically, since my data is not static, I need to figure out how to re-generate that POST request with the forms state AS IT WAS in order to really ""go back"". Or can the form state, and the screen be cached somehow?</p>

"5276559","<p>I've been doing server-side development for several years, and have not had much (read - practically no) web development experience.  My current employer is flush with ca$h at the moment and is offering to pay for training, so I thought it would be a great opportunity to learn.  I seem to learn best in a classroom setting with practice at home, so I was wondering if anyone had suggestions as to where would be a good place to learn this stuff.  There are some national firms that offer all kinds of training courses (e.g., LearningTree), but I have no idea how good they are.  Local college classes are an option too, as long as I don't have to go through a whole degree curriculum (I'm based in NYC/NJ).  </p>

<p>Stuff I'd like to learn includes Servlets/JSPs (starting at a very basic level but quickly moving through advanced), Tomcat, MVC, and integration with frameworks such as Spring.  I realize not all of that may come bundled together in one neat little package, but if got 70% of the way there that would be a win too.</p>

"5383486","<p>First, is it possible for when I insert a record onto my mysql table, a page is automatically generated using the new record in some way. EXAMPLE: My column ""image"" is on autoincrement, so my image names are always numbers. Furthermore, is it possible for when I insert a record, I automatically generate a page with my image name. So basically, I submit record 367, the image name is 367, and my site will automatically generate mysite.com/367? I want to go in more details but you get the point. Is it possible? If not, what's the closest thing possible?</p>

<p>Also, is there someway to automatically update my page periodically. Such as I set it so at 5pm, it'll automatically insert a code. 5:30pm, it'll insert a different code, which I preprogrammed to do. This is useful, for say I'm on vacation but I still want to update my site regularly.</p>

"5605610","<p>I have learn ruby almost two weeks. (I am working on java for two years, two years ago I do not know what's java and what java can do.) But now I can use java in my work(though I am not a java experter yet.)</p>

<p>But when I try to use ruby,I found it is so difficult!!!</p>

<p>After two weaks,I still can not write a ruby code.</p>

<p>The following problem confusing me most:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the ruby syntax</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is too flexible,I can not find any rule when I try to write the ruby code. For example the iterator in ruby. And too flexible means too many choices,but sometime too many choices is not a good idea.</p>

<p>In fact,maybe it is my own problem,I do not like javascirpt's syntax(also the perl,python..).  I just think the syntax of java is the best for reading and understanding....</p>

<p>So many people say ruby is simple and fast,but what do you mean simple???</p>

<p>In my opinion it is difficult to learn than java.</p>

<p>Everything in java is subject to the rules,so it is easy to start(though hard to be a experter).</p>

<p>I post here just want to know if some of you guys have the same problem with me? </p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the best tool out there to program shaders with? I've only used visual studio and <em>SOME</em> FX composer - read: enough to open it up and look at it.</p></li>

"5739133","<p>I'm preparing for an exam concerning languages, grammars, parsing and compilers. It's not really my cup of tea and most resources I find use the language of mathematics to define the different terms of the trade and explain the different concepts I need to know rather than stick with English or French, which I would very much prefer. Therefore, I'm having some trouble both with finding the motivation to continue studying and with simply understanding the theory.
So here is my question: Do any of you know where I could find a ""fun"" way of learning all this? Or at the very least, maybe a more ""concrete"" and less ""mathematical"" way of handling this subject.</p>

<p><strong>This is what I would like to do (objectives)</strong></p>

<p>I am trying to parse a newspaper sites article about politics</p>

<p>The url is <a href=""http://politiken.dk/politik/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://politiken.dk/politik/</a></p>

<p>The final project should</p>

<ul>
<li>1) each day (maybe each hour) visit
the above URL</li>
<li>2) for each relevant
article, I want to save the url to a
database. The relevant articles are
in a <code>&lt;div class=""w460 section_forside
sec-forside""&gt;</code>. Some of the elements have images, some
dont.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to save the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>a - the headline (<code>&lt;h1 class=""top-art-header fs-26""&gt;</code>)</li>
<li>b - the subheader (<code>&lt;p class=""subheader-art""&gt;</code>)</li>
<li><p>c - if the element has corresponding img, then the ""alt"" or ""title"" attribute</p></li>
<li><p>3) visit each relevant URL and scrape the articles body and save it to the database.</p></li>
<li>4) if each relevant URL is already in the database, then I skip that URL (the relevant articles as defined above are always the latest 10 published)</li>
</ul>

<p>The desired result should be a database table with fields:</p>

<ul>
<li>art.i) ID</li>
<li>art.ii) URL</li>
<li>art.iii) headline</li>
<li>art.iiii) subheader</li>
<li>art.iiiii) img alt</li>
<li>art.iiiiii) article body.</li>
<li>art.iiiiiii) date and time (a string located in <code>&lt;span class=""date tr-upper m-top-2""&gt;</code>) </li>
</ul>

<p>The above is what I would like help to accomplish. Since screen-scraping is not always benovelent, I would like to explain <strong>why I want to do this</strong>.</p>

<p>Basically I want to mine the data for occurences of 
members of parliment or political parties. I will not republish the articles, sell the data or some such thing (I have not checked the legality of my approach, but hope and think it should be legal)</p>

<p>I imagine I have a table of politicians and a table of political parties.</p>

<p>for each politician I will have:</p>

<ul>
<li>pol.i) ID</li>
<li>pol.ii) first_name</li>
<li>pol.iii) sur_name</li>
<li>pol.iiii) party</li>
</ul>

<p>For each political party I will have:</p>

<ul>
<li>party.i) ID</li>
<li>party.ii) correct-name</li>
<li>party.iii) calling-name
-party.iiii) abbrevation</li>
</ul>

<p>I want to do this for several danish newspaper sites, and then analyse if one newspaper
gives prefrences to some politicians / parties - simply based on number of mentions.</p>

<p>This I will also need help to do - but one step at a time :-)</p>

<p>Later I would like to explore NLTK and the posibilities for sentiment mining.</p>

<p>I want to see if this could turn in to a ph.d. project in political science/journalism.</p>

<p><strong>This is basically what I have (i.e. nothing)</strong></p>

<p>I really have a hard time wrapping my head around lxml, the concept of elements, the different parses etc. I have of course read the tutorials but I am still very much stuck.</p>

<pre><code>import lxml.html

url = ""http://politiken.dk/politik/""
root = lxml.html.parse(url).getroot()
# this should retur return all the relevant elements
# does not work:
#relevant = root.cssselect(""divi.w460 section_forside sec-forside"") # the class has spaces in the name - but I can't seem to escape them?

# this will return all the linked artikles headlines
artikler = root.cssselect(""h1.top-art-header"")

# narrowing down, we use the same call to get just the URLs of the articles that we have already retrieved
# theese urls we will later mine, and subsequently skip
retrived_urls=[]
for a in root.cssselect(""h1.top-art-header a""):
    retrived_urls.append(a)
# this works. 
</code></pre>

<p><strong>What I hope to get from the answers</strong></p>

<p>First of - as long as you don't call me (very bad) names - I would continue to be happy.</p>

<ul>
<li>But what I really hope is a simple to understand explanation of how lxml works. If I know what tools to use for the above tasks it would be so much easier for me to really ""dive into lxml"". Maybe because of my short attention span, I currently get disillusioned when reading stuff way above my level of understanding, when I am not even sure that I am looking in the right place.</li>
<li>If you could provide any example code that fits some of the tasks, that would be really great. I hope to turn this project into a ph.d. but I am sure this sort of thing must have been done a thousand times already? If so, it is my experience that learning from others is a great way to get smarter.</li>
<li>If you feel strongly that I should forget about lxml and use eg. scrapy or html5lib then please say so :-) I started to look into html5lib because Drew Conway suggests in a blog post about python tools for the political scientist, but I couldn't find any introduction level material. Alsp lxml is what the good people at scraperwiki recommends. As per scrapy, this might be the best solution, but I am afraid that scrapy is to much of a framework - as such really good if you know what you are doing, and want to do it fast, but maybe not the best way to learn python magic.</li>
<li>I plan on using a relational database, but if you think e.g. mongo would be an advantage, I will change my plans.</li>
<li>Since I can't install import lxml in python 3.1 I am using 2.6. If this is wrong - please say so also.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Timeframe</strong></p>

<p>I have asked a bunch of beginner questions on stackoverflow. Too many to be proud of. But with more then a fulltime job I never seem to be able to burry myself in code and just absorb the skillz I so long for. I hope this will be a question/answer that I can come back to regualy and update what I have learn, and relearn what I have forgot. This also means that this question will most likely remain active for quite some time. But I will comment on every answer that I might be lucky enough to recieve, and I will continuosly update the ""what I got"" section.</p>

<p>Currently I feel that I might have bitten off more then I can chew - so now it's back to ""head first python"" and ""learn python the hard way"".</p>

<p><strong>Final words</strong></p>

<p>If you have gotten this far - you are amazing - even if you don't answer the question. You have now read a lot of simple, confused, and stupid questions (I am proud of asking thoose questions, so don't argue). You should grap a coffe and a filterless smoke and congratulate your self :-)</p>

(b) Fair skills in computational programming (though that might not be of great help).
I want to generate the Utah teapot for which I have the data set. I have read the NeHe tutorials, but I really want to get my hands dirty. So could you please tell me how to use OpenGL with Dev C++. I know Visual C++ (suggested by NeHe) is far more convenient, however, as I have mentioned earlier, I want to rough it a bit.
Thanks a lot and have a nice day.</p>

Finally, it would be nice to have a simple way to package the whole thing up (deb, rpm, etc). Ideally my application should work on any Linux platform, and in Gnome or KDE.</p>

"6024826","<p>I'm just starting to get into backbone.js. It looks like it's pretty involved and won't be something you can just look at one example and say, ""Well, that's easy!"" and start being productive with it. It does look good though.</p>

<p>The documentation is okay, but I find myself not understanding the 'big picture' very well, and how all of these components work together. The way events are bound and rendered in the various views actually seems like a lot of entanglements. I understand the need for separation of concerns, but I am actually wondering if it's just a tad over-engineered.</p>

<p>Essentially... I won't be able to be immediately productive with backbone.js. There is going to be a a day or two learning curve I think.</p>

<p>What is the best way to get into backbone.js? Just keep chugging along, or are there some larger sample applications to download somewhere to look at?</p>

<p>Are there better alternatives that might be easier to learn and offer the same sort of benefits? For me, productivity and intuitiveness are pretty important. I sort of feel like the way backbone.js works is a little foreign. That could just be me.</p>

<p>Put another way, would it maybe be better to develop my application without a library like backbone and sort of organically create a framework like backbone.js but more like something that is intuitive to me and something more inline with the resultant code base?</p>

<p>I've been trying to get simple examples to work with my own code, and I get no Javascript errors... but it doesn't work. There's a good chance that ""one minor thing"" is wrong... but I'm beginning to feel that debugging my backbone applications might be a problem... so perhaps organically growing my own might actually be a better option for my own sanity. Debugging in the dark is a real productivity killer... and honestly, I'd rather do my own framework and write my own code if it spares me hours of endless debugging.</p>

<p>I don't know what to do - hence why I am asking.</p>

<p>For a language as flexible as Clojure, how can a beginner learn the idiomatic ways without having somebody else hand holding along the way?</p>

<p>An example of my mess:</p>

  (when-not (empty? (first lset))
    (if (reduce #(and %1 %2) (map #(stars/member* (front lset) %) (rest lset)))

        (intersectall (cons (rest (first lset)) (rest lset))))))

<p>In case you're wondering, the function <code>intersectall</code> merely returns a list of the common elements in all sub-lists of input.</p>

<p>So for:</p>

<pre><code>(def lset '((6 :pears :and)
        (3 :peaches :and 6 :peppers)

"6105010","<p>I'm asking for help so my life, and more importantly my user's lives will not be ruined by me not knowing how to use Services and Threads correctly.</p>

<p>I'm not asking for a long explanation, but more of a confirmation. It's fine if I'm dead wrong. I'm here to learn.</p>

<p>If I understand correctly:
1. a service runs in the background (no UI).
2. a service theoretically will run forever until it kills itself (I'm taking a big guess here)
3. a service will continue to run even when the main Activity is not visible (how about even destroyed?)</p>

"6416280","<p><strong>Note: Skip ahead to the bold &amp; italic paragraph down there if you don't like tl;dr.</strong></p>

<p>Alright, so I'm a huge computer geek, have been making websites since I was kid, etc. I am now moving to a dedicated server solution with Ubuntu, but for me, Linux user administration in particular has always been a very foreign concept.</p>

<p>But, probably because everyone thinks it's too simple and everyone knows about it already, I haven't been successful at finding a complete reference for the user system in Linux. The best I've had is a few concepts here and there and maybe a few poorly explained shell commands, but never anything that made me grasp the subject.</p>

<p>Here's what I'm trying to do: I'm trying to make a VPS (with Linode, it's already done and all) with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS, with a few users that may only have limited shell access or none at all, but still require it to do SFTP.</p>

<p>Here are a list of things I have been trying to do/comprehend without ever finding good written resources for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get an overview of all the users currently on the system (for management purposes)</li>
<li>Disable root and enable administration through another user</li>
<li>Create users with limited sets of permissions (such as only being able to see their own home folder)</li>
<li>Create users that can FTP in over SSH but not login through an SSH console</li>
<li>Manage folder and file permissions</li>
<li><strong>Understand all this</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>The last part is especially important. The problem is most guides explain things in ways that are incomprehensible from a total stranger's perspective. The commands work, but I still don't understand what's happening, which is not good.</p>

<p>Example of what I mean (from Linode Library):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To create normal users, use the
  adduser command in the following form:</p>
  
  <p>adduser [username]</p>
  
  <p>With the adduser command you can also
  be more specific with regards to what
  the user's home directory and default
  shell will be.
  The following command creates the user
  ""squire"" in the groups ""morris"" and
  ""leader"":</p>
  
  <p>adduser --home /home/squire \         ## specify a conventional home directory<br>
          --shell /bin/bash \              ## specify bash as the default shell<br>
          --ingroup morris leader squire   ## specify to which groups this user should belong</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While this all alright, there's a staggering lack of information for a newbie like me, like, what happens after running the adduser command, why /bin/bash, what's the syntax for he ingroup command, where is the username in the second list of commands, etc.</p>

<p>Well, you get the picture. The typical Linux system admin will tell me to RTFM without telling me how to do even just that. I need something that explains to me what's happening. Having a list of definitions and then jumping in is just no good because these definitions are totally out of context.</p>

<p><strong>The Actual Question</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>Does anyone know about a Linux Administration Book/Article/Whatever that would provide enough details on user administration as to do the equivalent of a teacher answering most of the questions students could possibly come up with during a course.</em></strong></p>

<p>I'm usually not that helpless, but for some reason, the Linux user system is very cryptic to me and 100% of the help available I have found has proven cryptic as well. Anyone care to light up my path of learning?</p>

"6526072","<p>Swing can be a frustrating beast.  Especially if you are trying to design an application with it that goes ""against the grain"" of the assumptions that the Swing designers used in designing Swing.  We have requirements that assign functionality to keystrokes that are way out of the normal.  Yesterday, the issue was that <code>JComboBox</code> and <code>JScrollPane</code> considered keys like PageUp and PageDown ""navigation keys"" and grabbed these in spite of our attempts to remap them to other uses when such components had focus.  You might say, that's poor design, but those are our requirements.  There are even special keyboard that have labels indicating these functional remappings and we have to meet those.  Such is life.</p>

<p>Today, another issue has popped up that a <code>JTextPane</code> seems to be grabbing the F6 key when it has focus.  When other components have focus, not a problem.  WTF?</p>

<p>And so, my question is simply this:  Is there any documentation on what keystrokes each type of Swing component is grabbing and placing outside the normal <code>InputMap/ActionMap</code> system that application level programmers are urged to follow?  I know this depends further on the <code>LookAndFeel</code>, and that what happens in <code>Motif</code> may be different than what happens in <code>Metal</code>, etc.  Still, even drilling down to this level, is this stuff documented anywhere?  I would like to know this so I might know at the start where my problems are going to lie instead of learning this one at a time.  If I know where the problems are I know how to work around them.

"6646244","<p><strong>Short version of my questions:</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Can anyone point me toward some good, detailed sources from which I
can learn how to implement testing in my MVC 3 application, using
NUnit, Ninject 2, and Moq?</li>
<li>Can anyone here help clarify for me how Controller-Repository
decoupling, mocking, and dependency injection work together?</li>
</ol>

<hr>

<p><strong>Longer version of my questions:</strong></p>

<p><strong>What I'm trying to do ...</strong></p>

<p>I am currently beginning to create an MVC 3 application, which will use Entity Framework 4, with a database first approach. I want to do this right, so I am trying to design the classes, layers, etc., to be highly testable. But, I have little to no experience with unit testing or integration testing, other than an academic understanding of them.</p>

<p>After lots of research, I've settle on using </p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NUnit</strong> as my testing framework</li>
<li><strong>Ninject 2</strong> as my dependency injection framework</li>
<li><strong>Moq</strong> as my mocking framework.</li>
</ul>

<p>I know the topic of which framework is best, etc., could enter into this, but at this point I really don't know enough about any of it to form a solid opinion. So, I just decided to go with these free solutions which seem to be well liked and well maintained. </p>

<p><strong>What I've learned so far ...</strong></p>

<p>I've spent some time working through some of this stuff, reading resources such as:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://www.asp.net/entity-framework/tutorials/implementing-the-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-in-an-asp-net-mvc-application""><strong>Implementing the Repository and Unit of Work Patterns in an
ASP.NET MVC Application</strong></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd942838.aspx""><strong>Building Testable ASP.NET MVC Applications</strong></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://nerddinnerbook.s3.amazonaws.com/Part12.htm""><strong>NerdDinner Step 12: Unit Testing</strong></a></li>
<li><a href=""http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2009/06/16/using-repository-and-unit-of-work-patterns-with-entity-framework-4-0.aspx""><strong>Using Repository and Unit of Work patterns with Entity Framework
4.0</strong></a></li>
</ul>

<p>From these resources, I've managed to workout the need for a Repository pattern, complete with repository interfaces, in order to decouple my controllers and my data access logic. I have written some of that into my application already, but I admit I am not clear as to the mechanics of the whole thing, and whether I am doing this decoupling in support of mocking, or dependency injection, or both. As such, I certainly wouldn't mind hearing from you guys about this too. Any clarity I can gain on this stuff will help me at this point.</p>

<p><strong>Where things got muddy for me ...</strong></p>

<p>I thought I was grasping this stuff pretty well until I started trying to wrap my head around Ninject, as described in <a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd942838.aspx"">Building Testable ASP.NET MVC Applications</a>, cited above. Specifically, I got completely lost around the point in which the author begins describing the implementation of a Service layer, about half way into the document.</p>

<p>Anyway, I am now looking for more resources to study, in order to try to get various perspectives around this stuff until it begins to make sense to me. </p>

<p>Summarizing all of this, boiling it down to specific questions, I am wondering the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Can anyone point me toward some good, detailed sources from which I
can learn how to implement testing in my MVC 3 application, using
NUnit, Ninject 2, and Moq?</li>
<li>Can anyone here help clarify for me how Controller-Repository
decoupling, mocking, and dependency injection work together?</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> </p>

<p>I just discovered the <a href=""https://github.com/ninject/ninject/wiki"">Ninject official wiki</a> on Github, so I'm going to start working through that to see if it starts clarifying things for me. But, I'm still very interested in the SO community thoughts on all of this :)</p>

"6814332","<p>I'm a relativly newcomer to Java and Android, so far it's been a truly enlightening experience. The biggest nuisance is simply setting up my projects in the first place. </p>

<p>I've noticed that I seem to be spending a lot of time downloading source-code of dependancy projects, manually building jars and then manually adding them to my eclipse project. <strong>I'm spending a lot of time sorting out my dependancies and I've not yet written a single line of code!!!</strong></p>

<p>When I write programs in Python which have complex dependancies I use setuptools: There's a really easy way to specify dependancies in the setup.py build file, and a correspondingly simple way to add those egg dependancies to my eclipse configuration. Despite Python's flaws it's remarkably easy to get up &amp; running with a new project. Projects with large dependancy trees are never a problem.</p>

<p>I wander if there's something I can do as a Java developer that's this easy. Even better I'd like something which takes a very casual approach to adding project dependancies - for example if somebody says ""Hey... try out this neat library for doing blahblah..."" - I want to be able to quickly add it to my project and run with it without having to think to hard about where the component comes from or how to compile up that dependancy.</p>

<p>What I want to do is start up a new project and simply select a bunch of dependancies. Preferably this should be via some kind of GUI tool. I'd like this to be as pain-free as possible: For example if I add a dependany to the project I'd like all that dependancy's dependancies to be automatically added to the project and my eclipse configuration.</p>

<p>I've no particular dislike of Maven - I just dont want to have to spend ages learning how to use it. I need to use the time to get to developing. If there was a way to make maven configuration a lot easier (e.g. no direct editing of XML files) then I'd probably go with that.</p>

<p>FYI, I'm running the latest version of Eclipse on both Ubuntu Linux &amp; Win32. I'm open to almost any solution which will take the pain out of setting up my Java developer envirobnment. I'm interested in solutions which will allow me to create android applications, however I'm also interested in more generic Java technologies but please be sure to note if the technology is not applicable to Android.</p>

"6841286","<p>There's a risk that this either comes across as a language-troll or a failure to do a basic Google search; rest assured it's not the former, and hopefully not the latter. Anyway, as a big-corporate Java developer (SE and EE) i'm feeling my skills go a bit stale, and i'm aware that for many years there's been some excitement about Python so it's been on my list of things to look into. I've read the first few chapters of O'Reilly's Learning Python, can hack some code together, and, fine, i'm getting the syntax.</p>

<p>But what i'm missing so far is the <em>why</em></p>

<p>There are plenty of lists of cool stuff about Python and why you should learn it, e.g. </p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Why_learn_Python"">http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Why_learn_Python</a></p>

<p>or here on SO there's some great discussion, e.g.</p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/203862/why-should-i-learn-python"">Why should I learn Python?</a></p>

<p>and </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/371966/are-there-any-good-reasons-why-i-should-not-use-python"">Are there any good reasons why I should not use Python?</a></p>

<p>to pick just a couple, but so far i've not found one that quite hits it. I'm looking for that lightbulb ""<em>ah, I see</em>"" moment where something useful that's maybe tricky in Java is solved by a few lines of Python, but i'm not quite there yet. E.g., from those links</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything can not only be done, but it can be done fast. For example a program that takes you weeks in C++ might take you a day in Python.</p>

<p>Sounds like me, i'm well aware i'm hitting everything with my Big Java Hammer. But what exactly is the kind of problem that suits a Python wrench rather than a Java Hammer? </p>

<p>There's lots more free/portable/lots of libraries/powerful etc. justifications, but all of these arguably apply to Java as well. You might quite reasonably respond that it all depends on what I want to do; i'm really looking for maybe another tool in the toolbox for usual development activities, from coding, testing (from unit to integration), through to log/trace parsing and troubleshooting in production. And, ultimately, if it's there i'll probably use it - and, heck, there are a fair few jobs out there that require Python. But to persevere up the learning curve I really need that <em>why</em>.</p>

"7007644","<p><strong>What I <em>think</em> I want:</strong></p>

<p>A language that would run persistently on a server to run recurring events that would be able to respond to html requests and give them tailored data.  The scheduled events would be dynamically timed and occur frequently.  The events would almost always be changes to database information, and the results would be viewed through a web application.</p>

<p><strong>Why I <em>think</em> PHP isn't going to work for me:</strong></p>

<p>Since I can only get my PHP to run when a user requests a page, or through a fixed rigid schedule, I'm having to look at the request time versus the last time it ran and fill in the gaps that should have happened. For example, if I had something that needed to occur every 15 minutes and no PHP scripts ran for several hours; then it would have to check how many were missed a run catch up to simulate what I believe should have happened in that time.</p>

<p><strong>Real world examples and specifics:</strong></p>

<p>I'm going to point to a really stupid example in this section because it's actually really pretty close in real-world concept to what I'm trying to explain.  The online game neopets has shops that restock every so often with randomly generated goods.  It restocks more if the store is emptier during every ~15 minute restock but the old items remain.  </p>

<p>This isn't what I want exactly, but I recognized that at it's basic concept was extremely similar.  I'll be extrapolating some odd additions to this system as I think it makes more sense than what I'm actually doing.</p>

<p>What should I do to recreate this shop but with the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
<li>Restock times are dynamically derived from other events occurring (set time since another item sells perhaps), therefore the schedule isn't a rigid ""every quarter hour"" that I can run through scheduled PHP scripts.  Instead it could be exactly at 5:46:23PM</li>
<li>The ""restocking"" is derived from other time specific information.  I am unable to just simulate all restocks that should have occurred once a new customer checks the page.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What direction should I go?</strong></p>

<p>I have no idea what I'm talking about so assume the following is shit:</p>

<p>I suspect I am wanting a persistent running program on the server that performs these tasks and puts the results into a database which is then accessed and delivered through php to the end user.  I'm really just getting started though and I know I'm very likely making a very stupid assumption.  Is there something that is both the persistent program and PHP together that I should learn?  </p>

<p>I'm doing this as a hobby and just want to learn more so I can make more fun toys for myself.</p>

"7016885","<p>Which is the easiest Python web application framework to get started with, for general use?</p>

<p>Referring to easiest - I mean one which a short learning curve / time, at least in order to be able to use it for fairly simple apps. I have worked on non-trivial Ruby on Rails projects earlier, so it is not that I can't learn a more complex framework, it's just that for this particular app, I do not want to spend a lot of time learning the framework that I use - since this is more of an experimental app to test the idea - see below for more on that. If it turns out that the app idea is useful, I have no problem about later changing to a different framework and rewriting the entire app in that, after learning that framework properly.</p>

<p>I want to create a small web app - a personal productivity tool. Initially at least, it will be only for my personal use, though later I may consider opening it up to use by others, under whatever terms. Right now, I just want to prototype the idea and then use it some, myself, on a day-to-day basis, for a while, to get a feel for whether the app is actually useful or not for my productivity. By ""general use"" (in the title of this question), I mean that the suggested Python web app framework should not be specialized to any particular area, such as, say, Zope <em>may</em> (not sure) be more suited for creating CMS's (Content Management Systems). Also, the framework preferably should not put restrictions on what I can do, except for any restrictions that may be inherent in, or common to, all web app frameworks. (As an example of that last statement, the HTTP request/response cycle is, I guess, common to all, so all web app frameworks, whether in Python or not, put that restriction on the user/developer, that they have to implement their app in that style. Oh yes, and the framework should support creating database-backed web apps (which I guess most do, but mentioning it anyway). I should mention that I have tried out CherryPy (with SQLite) a little - not enough yet to decide whether it is suitable or not, also had some errors which I am working on resolving, but am anyway looking for other suggestions as well.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I do understand the value of learning for its own sake and I am genuinely <em>curious</em> and <em>interested</em> in learning Rails 3.

<p>Or to put it another way, if I invest a week or two on Rails 3 tutorials, will it pay off in huge times savings later because Rails 3 development is way more efficient?</p>

<h2>Other question</h2>

"7224823","<p>I am a C++ programmer trying to learn Common Lisp. I have looked at some books like Land of Lisp and read numerous online articles about the various virtues of Lisp. However, I need some advice.</p>

<p>Almost everything I have read about Common Lisp has to do with how amazing it is and how amazingly fast you can get stuff done with it and how it amazingly solved many problems with modern programming languages 30 years ago. Also how amazing macros are, and how every every programming paradigm (OO, functional, actor based or whatever, etc) can be used in Lisp, and how lists are the ultimate data structure. Basically treating Lisp like a research language and saying how different and revolutionary it is.</p>

<p>And all that stuff is probably true, but the problem is I haven't seen much stuff how to do practical things like read a file and split it into words and do some processing on it. I'm not interested in learning Common Lisp for the sake of learning Common Lisp, but for the sake of getting thing that I used to do in C++ done faster and with fewer errors.</p>

<p><strong>So my question is</strong> what is the best resource (be it a website, book, anything) that <em>focuses on teaching how to use Common Lisp to do common programming tasks</em> like</p>

<ul>
<li>How to read files</li>
<li>How to read a file, replace words in the file, and write the result back to the file</li>
<li>Iterate the files in a directory and other filesystem stuff</li>
<li>Interact with an SQL db</li>
<li>Do communications over sockets</li>
<li>Threading for stuff like a webserver</li>
<li>Create GUIs</li>
<li>Perform operations on binary files</li>
<li>Write a parser (not an interpreter for Lisp in Lisp, which as I understand is like 5 lines of Lisp)</li>
<li>Interact with the operating system (i.e. stuff written in C or C++) to do stuff Lisp can't do natively</li>
<li>How to write Lisp extensions in C (is that possible?)</li>
<li>Embed a lua interpreter (is that possible?)</li>
</ul>

<p>And also on a less immediately practical note, how to implement common data structures in lisp such as an heap, stack, binary search tree, etc. However that may be just using Lisp's list operations like <code>car</code> and <code>cdr</code> in the right way. I don't know.</p>

<p>I highly doubt that any of this (with the unlikely exception of the last two in the list) is impossible with Lisp or people wouldn't love it so much. And the aforementioned stuff that I've read mentions plenty of real world software written in Lisp (Yahoo! web store comes to mind).</p>

<p>However, having programming in a (<em>the?</em>) imperative language before, I am anxious to get to using what new knowledge I get to write real-world applications. So what's the quickest way to learn writing practical software with Lisp?</p>

<p>By the way, I have seen Peter Seibel's <em>Practical Common Lisp</em> but, judging by the TOC, it only touches on <em>some</em> of the things I would like to learn to use Lisp to do.</p>

<p>One more question if I may (sorry if this is combining two questions into one), where can I find a reference to Lisp's functions and stuff?</p>

<p>And I <em>really</em> want to like Lisp.</p>

<p>After I successfully got a hello world in Google App Engine, I followed all the instructions from the Facebook Example. However, when going to localhost port 8080 (Getting Started, step 8) I'm prompted with the annoying ""Please Update Your Secure Canvas URL"" error; pressing Continue doesn't do anything but to prompt me again to update my URL.</p>

<p>I read that the dev_appserver.py doesn't have SSL support, so I guess that's why when I put localhost port 8080 with SSL in my Secure Canvas URL, I get a ssl_error_rx_record_too_long error. So that's a dead end.</p>

<p>Now, I read that maybe my personal security settings as an admin of the app was messing things up. So, I tried with a test user; using localhost with SSL as a Secure Canvas URL pops the same error than before, but leaving it in blank gets me to the running with friends homepage; just before I was going to claim victory, I noticed that the refresh icon was going crazy, so by opening firebug I saw that the site was going GET requests like crazy; I opened the headers of the queries and got this:</p>

<pre><code>Reload the page to get source for: https://apps.facebook.com/facebook-skuiz/

<p>as long with other GET request that does other GET request that... well, you get the drill.</p>

EXTERNAL_HREF = 'http://facebook-skuiz.appspot.com/'

# Facebook User IDs of admins. The poor mans admin system.

I can do it, but it takes me inordinately long, and even after this excessive effort, I'm never sure that the grammar I've come up with is good (by any reasonable measure of ""good"").</p>

<p>I don't expect that there is an algorithm for automating the process of specifying a grammar, but I hope that there ways to structure the problem that will let me get rid of much of the guesswork and trial-and-error of my current approach.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where can I learn how to specify a formal grammar for a given syntax?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: I don't expect that an answer to this question will teach me how to how to translate a syntax into a formal grammar.  The topic is too big to be adequately addressed in a reply in SO.  I'm looking for a pointer to the literature.  Any references to a good how-to on this would be appreciated.  An ideal reference would be the something in the spirit of Friedl's <a href=""http://books.google.com/books/about/Mastering_regular_expressions.html?id=NYEX-Q9evKoC"" rel=""nofollow"">book</a> on regular expressions, but devoted to the problem of specifying an entire grammar.</p>

<p><strong>Further clarifications, etc.</strong></p>

<p>My attempts to learn this skill has been to read stuff on parsers, but everything I've read on this subject so far takes the grammar for the parser as a given (or trivial enough that one can specify it easily by inspection), and focuses instead on the problem of implementing a parser for this grammar.  I'm interested in the problem immediately before: how to specify the grammar in the first place.</p>

<p>I'm using the term grammar somewhat loosely to include not only the grammar, but also the corresponding specification for the lexical analyzer.  In other word, the ""grammar"" I'm thinking of is one whose ""atoms"" are not tokens, but rather characters (or unicode characters if you prefer).  (I gather that this would correspond to the two-part problem of writing an input file for lex or flex, specifying the ""grammar"" for the lexical analyzer/tokenizer, and an input file for yacc or bison, specifying the grammar proper.  The distinction between the lexical analysis and parsing stages seems to me a bit artificial, and I gather that some parsing packages abolish it altogether, but I admit that my grasp on all this is very tenuous, so these parenthetical remarks may very well be all hogwash.)</p>

<p>One more clarification: As the example I began this post with already makes clear, I am not concerned at the moment with the problem of designing a syntax (as language designer would have to do, for example) although I'm sure it is an interesting problem of its own right.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>[I originally asked this a version of this question in programmers.SE, but learned that questions that ask for a reference to the literature are frowned upon in that stack, because they don't lend themselves to extended, discursive replies, so I'm trying my luck here.]</p>

"7746938","<p>I have been fighting with zend framework for quite some time now. The issue is not PHP itself but these myriad of classes and the relationships between them. for example: i started reading this :http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/learning.layout.usage.html
Well everything is fine until the author mentioned the following:
To initialize Zend_Layout, add the following to your configuration file </p>

<pre><code> resources.layout.layoutPath = APPLICATION_PATH ""/layouts/scripts""
    resources.layout.layout = ""layout""
</code></pre>

<p>I am like wow!!! wait a minute where is this layout() method located and i kept chasing these methods and classes until i get dizzy and give up.</p>

"7827128","<p>I'd like to see C++ in action by macroing trigger actions in closed-source video games.  For example, there's a game on every Windows machine called Space Pinball.  I would like to macro in some key-bound targeting by figuring out the physics of the ball and the force of the flippers.  Another game that would be fun to play would be something like Final Fantasy VII.  I have some simple math that I do in my head as I play FFVII on an emulator on my machine.  I usually play in the underground submarine to level up, and I want to have my characters burn the appropriate spells or items based on their hp and what-have-you.  I also want to include an autobuy function.  Similarly, getting the Gold Chocobo takes forever.  I wonder if I could automate this as a coding project....</p>

<p>The two main parts of macroing/botting, I imagine, would be:
A) Receiving info from the games, and
B) Sending latency-free keystrokes to the games.</p>

<p>I anticipate many other troubles, of course.</p>

<p>Now, someone told me a good way to get started would be to build my own text-only versions of the games and try to mess around with the code there to get everything right.  Since I'm starting to get pretty good at that, I think I'm ready to tackle the barriers I've listed above.  How can I start to get to the point where I can macro games? :D</p>

"8032413","<p>Please exuse my ignorance but SQL Server is not my strong point and I start to get lost when going past the basic Create Table, Select from Table etc.</p>

<p>I am attempting to set up a database syncronisation scenario with an Microsoft SQLCompact 3.5 database being Synced through a Proxy to and SQL 2008 R2 database. It is being synced through the Microsoft Sync Framework 2.1.</p>

<p>I got everything set up and working fine through the proxy when the user account is the db_owner of the database. </p>

<p>Of course this now needs to be locked down - so I have been trying to restrict the permissions to the bare minimum required for Syncronisation.</p>

<p>According to the Microsoft articles, I need to do the following...</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Use the principle of least permission. Do not grant more permissions than are required to perform a specific task. For example, do not grant INSERT permissions for server database tables that are involved in download-only synchronization. Synchronization operations require the following permissions:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>EXECUTE permissions on all the stored procedures that Sync Framework uses to read and write to metadata tables and base tables.</p>
    
    <p>SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE permissions for metadata tables and any base tables that will be updated during a synchronization session.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>When you provision SQL Server databases that use SqlSyncProvider, be aware of the following permissions requirements for provisioning:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>CREATE TABLE permissions to enable creation of the metadata tables: scope_info and scope_config, and the tracking tables that are created for each base table.</p>
    
    <p>ALTER TABLE to add triggers to the base tables.</p>
    
    <p>CREATE PROCEDURE permissions to create the procedures that Sync Framework requires.</p>
    
    <p>SELECT and INSERT permissions for scope_info and scope_config tables.</p>
    
    <p>SELECT permissions for base tables.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>I allowed the wizards in Visual Studio 2010 to create the Sync database and proxy for me.</p>

<p>As such - I am unable to find the scope_info and scope_config tables in SQL Server databases, and I am also unable to find the metadata tables so cannot set permissions on these tables. Also - where would I find the stored procedures that the Syncronisation framework is trying to use - I have looked but cannto find them.</p>

<p>Where would I find these and how would I go about setting the appropriate permissions? </p>

<p>I have granted datareader and datawriter, Insert, Update, Delete and Select as well as Execute permissions on the SQL Server database but the sync fails. I have also granted Create Table, Create Procedure and  ALTER permissions on the database for the user as well- but still it fails.</p>

<p>If i enable the db_owner role for the user - it works.</p>

<p>The error I receive is...</p>

<p>Unable to initialize the client database, because the schema for table 'tblApplications, tblApplicationConfiguration, tblApplicationInstallProperties, tblApplicationPreRequisites, tblApplicationTypes, tblComputerApps, tblComputers, tblComputerTypes, tblDriveHWSerials, tblDrives, tblDriveTypes, tblFunctions, tblLocationApps, tblLocationComputers, tblLocationIPAddress, tblLocations, tblLocationUsers, tblPermissions, tblRegionLocations, tblRegions, tblRegisteredModules, tblRequestFormats, tblRequestStatus, tblRequestTypes, tblRoles, tblRoleUsers, tblSecurity, tblUsers, tblVehicle, tblVehicleLocationMap, tblVehicleMake, tblRequestProcessingStatus, tblDriveStatus, tblVideoViewTypes' could not be retrieved by the GetSchema() method of DbServerSyncProvider. 
Make sure that you can establish a connection to the client database and that either the SelectIncrementalInsertsCommand property or the SelectIncrementalUpdatesCommand property of the SyncAdapter is specified correctly.</p>

<p>Any help on what I am missing would be much appreciated. I am not able to use the db_owner role when its released.</p>

<p>Cheers</p>

"8221077","<p>Well, everything is in the question but let's explain.</p>

<p>As a student in web development, I work with PHP, mainly through CMSs.</p>

<p>I already know the basic knowledge on the famous MVC design pattern, but now would like to work with a framework.</p>

<p>I've just discovered RoR and Django (respectively Ruby &amp; Python Frameworks) and my first experiments with these frameworks, coupled to the amazing syntaxes of their languages, completely blown me away.</p>

<p>I've already made my choice : Django. (Just to explain : Throughout my researches, I learnt that Django's philosophy is : ""There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it."", and that RoR's motto was exactly the opposite. As a noobie, I think it would be better to work on an app that naturally leads me to the best practises. I can also add that Django seems to be far more transparent and easier to understand, compared to the weird ""magic"" of Ruby).</p>

<p>The problem is that learning the language and the Framework will may be a difficult task.</p>

<p>My objectives are :
   - Mastering Python + Django.
   - Learn the right way to develop MVC applications.
   - Become productive as fast as possible.</p>

<p>And considering that Django and Cake PHP are quite ""similar"", should I first learn ""MVC in the real world"" with Cake PHP before trying to begin directly with Python + Django or not ? What would you do, according to your experience ?</p>

<p>Pros for learning Cake Php first :
Some of my friends already work with Cake and they could help.
Learning something new is always a nice line to add on the CV.</p>

<p>Cons :
Learning something new is always a bit stupid when you are 95% convinced you won't use it anymore in the future.</p>

<p>I am a newbie in the programming world. I barely know the basics of C(and am lacking quite a lot). 
I wish to start coding games with C, not with C++ because I have found out that C++ is much harder than i assumed it was.
I checked out the recently disclosed source code of Doom3 and it was written in C++, I didn't understand the code as it was quite OOP(ish).</p>

<p>I did not find the entry point of the game, however I found multiple int main in the source and was baffled.</p>

<p>I read up on game engines, however I still cannot understand them even after multiple reads.
I actually don't want to do 2D games, 3D is what i want to do, but I do not know how. How are the graphics made,when you walk how come an object is still there and not disappearing to be redrawn again,how is gravity simulated, and much more.</p>

"8316446","<p>I'm have developed a couple of apps in iPhone and Android, and am now looking to understand how Phone Gap fits into the mobile picture. Since I have an existing database-driven (mySql) web application coded in php, css and javascript, I'd like to convert to an iPhone and/or Android app using PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile. </p>

<p>What I'd like to do for now is find some tutorial to code a simple PhoneGap based app. Then graduate to another slightly more complex one which uses html5 for local data storage. I've started working through Jonathan Stark's excellent tutorial, ""Building iPhone Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript"" at <a href=""http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596805784/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ofps.oreilly.com/titles/9780596805784/index.html</a>. But jQtouch figures significantly in that tutorial, and I would prefer to use the more up-to-date jQuery Mobile library if at all possible. </p>

<p>Also, from what little I've been able to glimmer thusfar, it may be necessary to restructure the web app so the Javascript is separate from the PHP. This seems like a lot of work for something which I was hoping to just put a Phone Gap wrapper around.</p>

<p>So my two questions are 1) can someone please advise on good tutorial with examples to get untracked on PhoneGap and jQuery Mobile development? </p>

<p>And 2, confirm that ripping the PHP out of the app is my only option in order to get it to run as a web app?  </p>

But for different reasons javascript hasn't been in the priorities that I've been asked to do. Don't get me wrong I've developed dozens of websites and I've used my own snippets of javaScript and used also many Jquery plugins. But I think it's time to really learn and be able to do something better than the meaningless stuff that I usually do with this great language.</p>

<p>The problem is that I think it's quite overwhelming to study this language properly, I just don't know which approach I should give it. I keep reading books but either I feel that I already know some stuff or I feel completely clueles...</p>

<p>I know you're going to say, stop writing stupid questions and go on cracking them books. You are right but I do think you folks could give me some advice and some tips on how did you manage to master the language, what was that you find the hardest, what would you tell a beginner to focus on... believe me this is useful stuff for me and hopefully it is also for someone else out there.</p>

"8364547","<p>I'd like to build a restful service to return some JSON data to a mobile application. I've worked with Grails in the past - it's pretty much perfect for this - but I'd like to learn Spring for my own purposes, mostly because it's the dominant Java-based server technology. So, I'm thinking about building the service in Spring MVC 3 for my own edification. But, one problem already is my hosting service doesn't support Spring - nor Grails for that matter.  They do support Ruby on Rails and PHP. </p>

<p>My question - how heavy of a learning curve is it to get Spring up and running with a restful service? Is there a really good tutorial/learning resource to learn Spring in a short amount of time? Also, will it be difficult/expensive to find a hosting server? Or should I throw in the towel and go with Ruby or PHP? </p>

I'm complete newbie, only reached day 2 of an old book ""Teach yourself C++ in 21 days"" by Jesse Liberty and the program looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

using namespace std;

    int main()
    {
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Hello there.""; endln;
        cout &lt;&lt; ""Here is 5: "" &lt;&lt; 5 &lt;&lt; endl;
        cout &lt;&lt; ""The manipulator endln writes a new line to the screen"";

        cout &lt;&lt; ""Hampus is a C++ programmer!"";
        return 0;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Is MinGW C++ the same as GNU C++? Is there an official standard? any advice for newbie learning / teaching will be appriciated. The book I'm following is ""Teach yourself C++ in 21 days"" and it is and old edition of the book but I could modify the programs from the first exercise to run and I believe I can use the book since perhaps not many changes were made to the basic C++ since it was published (the edition of the book I own is maybe 10 years old).</p>

"8375643","<p>This is a topic that has been part of almost every application I've ever worked on and yet I don't have a good name for it.  I'd love to learn more about best practices and ideally find books/research on the topic but I don't even have a name for it to Google.  I'm hoping I can describe the topic here and people can point me towards a name, or even better, books, which discuss the topic.</p>

<p>What I've been calling it now is server-client synchronization.  It's the practice of sending notifications to clients to update them when the game state has changed.  The best way to describe it is with an example.</p>

<p>As an example consider a web-based game of Spades that is in progress.  The currently active player plays a card and takes the trick.  Several changes happen in the server side model as a result of this.  The trick is cleared, the player has a new trick, the game possibly ended, etc.</p>

<p>This information needs to be communicated with the clients and there is a whole slew of options.  Most likely the server is going to send events in some way (these events may even be sent by polling).  The events could simply say ""Player 3 played the 8 of Spades"" and force the client to figure out all the corresponding changes in the model.  The events could be as detailed as, ""8 of Spades moved from player 3's hand to the board, the trick was cleared, player 3 gained a new trick"".</p>

<p>So again, my question is.  What is this topic called and how do I find books/discussions on best patterns and practices?</p>

"8380288","<p>I'm working on a personal project. It's to recreate server software for the game ""Chu Chu Rocket"" for the Sega Dreamcast. Its' servers went down in 2004 I believe. My approach is to use dnsmasq to change the originl hostname that the game originally connected to, to my own system. With a DC-PC server set up, I have done just that, now instead of it looking up a non-existent dns record, it connects to my computer which will eventually run the server software. I've used tshark (cli wireshark) to capture what's going on between the client (dreamcast) and the server (my computer). The problem is, I'm getting data, but I'm not sure how to interpret it, I don't know what it's saying, but I'm sure it can be done because private PSO servers were created, those are far more complex.</p>

<p>Very simply, where would I go about learning how to interpret data packets, and possibly creating packets that will respond to such queries from the client?</p>

 accountinstance.provide_list('users', 'loginproblems')

"8656989","<p>Weird title, I know, let me explain.</p>

<p>I am a developer most familiar with C# and Javascript. I am completely sunk into those semi-functional worlds to the point that most of my code is about mapping/reducing/filtering collections. In C# that means I use LINQ just about everywhere, in Javascript it's Underscore.js and jQuery. </p>

<p>I have currently been assigned to an ongoing Java project and am feeling rather stifled. I simply do not think in terms of ""create an array, shuffle stuff from one to another"". I can (and did) create my own versions of the main map/reduce functions using anonymous types implementing interfaces but why re-invent the wheel? The project I am currently on already has commons-collections-3.1.jar and looking through the classes contained it seems like it likely can do everything that I want and more.</p>

<p>For the life of me, I can't find how to actually use it. Looking through the dozens of classes therein is not very helpful and the only thing I can google up <a href=""http://commons.apache.org/collections/apidocs/"" rel=""nofollow"">is the api doc</a> which is equally as helpful.</p>

<p>How do you use it to Map/Select, Filter/Where, Reduce/Aggregate? Is there anywhere that gives an actual tutorial on this library?</p>

<pre><code>class Human

    @noise = noise
  end

  def noise
    @noise

<pre><code>man = Human.new
man.noise=(""Howdie!"")
puts man.noise
</code></pre>

<p>This results in <code>Howdie!</code></p>

<p>Now what confuses me is that the instructor is saying without the getter method (the 2nd of the two methods), there is no way to interact with the instance variable @noise.</p>

<p>But when I remove the getter method, I'm able to still access @noise, see example:</p>

<pre><code>class Human
  def noise=(noise)
    @noise = noise
  end
end

man = Human.new
puts man.noise=(""Howdie!"")

<p>This works the same as when the getter method it used.</p>

They have 4 neurons, and each neuron activates movement in one direction (it's a 2D plane viewed from the bird's perspective, so there are only four directions, thus, four outputs are required). Their only input are four ""eyes"". Only one eye can be active at the time, and it basically serves as a pointer to the nearest object (either a green food block, or another organism).</p>

<p>Thus, the network can be imagined like this:
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gbpBg.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And an organism looks like this (both in theory and the actual simulation, where they really are red blocks with their eyes around them):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/inCNp.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>And this is how it all looks (this is an old version, where eyes still didn't work, but it's similar):</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FD9K0.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Now that I have described my general idea, let me get to the heart of the problem...</p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Initialization</strong>|
First, I create some organisms and food. Then, all the 16 weights in their neural networks are set to random values, like this: weight = random.random()*threshold*2. Threshold is a global value that describes how much input each neuron needs to get in order to activate (""fire""). It is usually set to 1.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learning</strong>|
By default, the weights in the neural networks are lowered by 1% each step. But, if some organism actually manages to eat something, the connection between the last active input and output is strengthened.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>But, there is a big problem. I think that this isn't a good approach, because they don't actually learn anything! Only those that had their initial weights randomly set to be beneficial will get a chance of eating something, and then only them will have their weights strengthened! What about those that had their connections set up badly? They'll just die, not learn.</p>

<p>How do I avoid this? The only solution that comes to mind is to randomly increase/decrease the weights, so that eventually, someone will get the right configuration, and eat something by chance. But I find this solution to be very crude and ugly. Do you have any ideas?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Thank you for your answers! Every single one of them was very useful, some were just more relevant. I have decided to use the following approach:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set all the weights to random numbers.</li>
<li>Decrease the weights over time.</li>
<li>Sometimes randomly increase or decrease a weight. The more successful the unit is, the less it's weights will get changed. NEW</li>
<li>When an organism eats something, increase the weight between the corresponding input and the output.</li>
</ol>

"9055437","<p>I learned php using just the website php.net, but I'm struggling to do the same with Java.
I would like to reach my php level with jsp and generally java, but I find the official docs way too much difficult to read, and if I have a task to accomplish it's quite impossible (to me) without googling and stackoverflowing.
I am wondering if it's normal, or I'm ignoring some secret about the APIs I should know.</p>

<p>I want to make an example: if I have to manipulate a string in a way, I look the PHP manuals for the string functions, and look for the ones I could use reading the brief description I find there.</p>

<p>But if I want to do the same with Java, ok, I know that there's the String class, but there are also an incredible amount of other classes, inherited classes, abstract superclasses, accessories, methods inherited from, interfaces, and I don't know what, that's impossible to read anything (if I'd try perhaps I'll learn Java in the following life).</p>

<p>So I have to rely to manuals websites and google, and find guides and tutorials which describe how to do a particular task (for example, connecting to a Tomcat server and manipulate a DB);</p>

<p>But I don't like to rely to external sources, I would like to find what I need at the source, as I had the experience of my php.net pages which are so precise and full of info and examples.</p>

<p>So? What am I missing?</p>

<p>I am quite sure there's a way to find the right info starting from the api. is it true? and how?</p>

I'm 5 fold cross validating with a  18x17 grid search on my training set then using the optimal parameters for my test set. the runs are taking a lot longer than I expected and I have noticed the following:</p>

<p>1) Some individual SVM training iterations seem to take only a minute, while others can take up to 15 minutes. Is this expected with different data and parameters (C and gamma, I'm using <code>rbf</code> kernel)?</p>

<p>2) I'm trying to use 64 bit python on windows to take advantage of the extra memory, but all my python processes seem to top at 1 gig in my task manager, I don't know if that has anything to do with the runtime.</p>

<p>3) I was using 32bit before and running on about the same dataset, and i remember (though I didn't save down the results) it being quite a bit faster. I used a third party build of scikit-learn for 64 bit windows, so I don't know if it's better to try this on 32 bit python? (source <a href=""http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/</a>)</p>

<p>Any suggestions on how I can reduce runtime would be greatly appreciated. I guess reducing the search space of my grid search will help but as I'm unsure of even the range of optimal parameters, I'd like to keep it as large as i can. If there are faster SVM implementations as well, please let me know, and I may try those.</p>

<p>Addendum: I went back and tried running the 32bit version again. It's much faster for some reason. It took about 3 hours to get to where the 64bit version got to in 16 hours. Why would there be such a difference?</p>

So, I have started to put together a very basic <a href=""https://github.com/barobba/RDF-SPARQL-Starter-Kit"">starter kit</a> for myself, but I wanted to see if there is anything else out there that might be better... something like the interactive command lines that many scripting languages offer, or like phpMyAdmin (but for triples).</p>

<p>I have seen:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Some Web front ends, attached to endpoints such as OpenLink (an example is <a href=""http://dbpedia.org/sparql"">http://dbpedia.org/sparql</a>), but the ones I have seen still require a lot of manual work (because they are intended for a general audience).</p></li>
<li><p>There are tools like the Tabulator (http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2007/tab/), but their focus is more on combining and visualizing datasets rather than creating new datasets.</p></li>
<li><p>A lot of work also goes into describing existing data in RDF.</p></li>
<li><p>Some tools that are paid online services (I would prefer to install my own)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Does anyone know of a system to help get started creating an initial RDF store, and setting user preferences, etc., to get started with new projects that use RDF.</p>

"9255360","<p>My primary interest in programming, my motivation and what keeps me going, is to be able to write a program using the Betfair API. My skills however are extremely basic.</p>

<p>I was reading a text regarding improving your reading performance, and it suggested an approach of reading headlines and summaries first before focusing on details. The principle is to keep yourself interested and motivated avoiding unnecessary information. The text suggested flexible reading on what you consider important skipping walls of text you are already familiar with or with little use.</p>

<p>The above got me thinking.</p>

<p>I found an introductory tutorial about Betfair API on their forums: <a href=""http://forum.bdp.betfair.com/showthread.php?t=112"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.bdp.betfair.com/showthread.php?t=112</a></p>

<p>I had a glance through it and I am not familiar with the syntax (yet)</p>

<p>The question to experienced programmers is:</p>

<p>a) should i skip the tutorial until I have finished reading a text book in VB.NET?<br>
b) should I focus on a textbook in VB.NET concurrently with the tutorial? To keep me interested and motivated?<br>
c) should I focus on the tutorial, perhaps using trial and error, asking questions in forums or searching online for things I don't understand?</p>

<p>I guess my ultimate goal is not to learn VB.NET but to be able to write a working application. If its not the goal its what motivates me.</p>

"9273729","<p>So, I am pretty confused on the below code. It its directly quoted from C++ for Dummies 5th ed, minus the comments I made. </p>

<pre><code>class student{
public:
    int semesterHours;
    float gpa;
    student valFriend; //I thought to use the name of the class as a data type
    student&amp; refFriend;
    student* ptrFriend; 
}; //then this line should read .. '}student;' to enable something like the above

int main()
{
    student&amp; student = *new student; //new student object 'student'
    student.gpa = 2.0;

    student&amp; studentFriend = *new student; //new student object 'studentFriend'
    studentFriend.gpa = 4.0;

    student.valFriend = studentFriend;

    student.pFriend = &amp;studentFriend;

}
</code></pre>

<p>Within the class 'student' are those objects of itself? How is that even possible? If I am looking at this correctly, are two new objects being allocated off the heap with the respective names 'student' and 'studentFriend' using the new function?</p>

<p>Then the object student.valFriend is being assigned all values that are of the object 'studentFriend.' </p>

<p>The last bit of code appears to me to be assigning some undeclared member object of the class 'student' the reference of studentFriend? Perhaps someone could explain this one a bit more explicitly. A simply fix is that possibly in the text it was meant to be 'student.ptrFriend,'  but would they not have saw that? Maybe I'm the one missing something. Otherwise, I don't understand the syntax of this line. </p>

<p>On top of all this, the code does not even compile. What is going on here? I suppose the reason for not compiling could be because it is just a bit of code in a section about referencing and pointers. Nonetheless, it is still confusing. </p>

"9569153","<p>I'm relatively new to JAX-RS, JPA, GlassFish, Java DB, and NetBeans, and I'd like to write unit tests for my code. [Version numbers are at the bottom.] However, I'm stuck on where to begin. I've done a good bit of searching, but I don't yet have a clear understanding of how to set up an embedded test of my code. I'm using NetBeans, but my question is general. I wish I could form my question more clearly, but this is the best I could do. So far I've found the following possible pieces (more like hints at this point). </p>

<p>o I want to set this up without Maven, but this means I must install the embedded jars manually. <em>Q: Where do I find them?</em></p>

<p>o Create versions of my config xml files (glassfish-resources.xml and persistence.xml) that specify embedded versions of GlassFish and Java DB. <em>Q: But how do you tell NetBeans to use those for testing rather than production ones that rely on the installed version of them?</em></p>

<p>I think persistence.xml would look something like this (from <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8459284/using-hibernate-with-embedded-derby"">using hibernate with embedded derby</a>):</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;property name=""javax.persistence.jdbc.driver"" value=""org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver""/&gt;
  &lt;property name=""javax.persistence.jdbc.url"" value=""jdbc:derby:test""/&gt;
  &lt;property name=""javax.persistence.jdbc.user"" value=""root""/&gt;
  &lt;property name=""javax.persistence.jdbc.password"" value=""root""/&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>o Create a custom Glassfish domain configuration file ( <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6739987/embedded-glassfish-ignores-maven-test-resources"">Embedded GlassFish ignores Maven test resources</a> ). <em>Q: What should this look like? I have domain.xml from the default domain1 that was created with my NetBeans install, but there's a lot to it.</em></p>

<p>o Once my project has access to the embedded files, and it is configured to use them, what should my JUnit harness look like? <a href=""http://jersey.java.net/nonav/documentation/latest/client-api.html#d4e759"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jersey.java.net/nonav/documentation/latest/client-api.html#d4e759</a> says:</p>

  ...
    glassfish = new GlassFish(BASE_URI.getPort());
    ScatteredWar war = new ScatteredWar(...);
    glassfish.deploy(war);
  ...
</code></pre>

<p>However, I've also seen EJBContainer mentioned, e.g., (from <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gkcqz.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/gkcqz.html</a> ):</p>

<pre><code>@BeforeClass
public static void initContainer() throws Exception {
  ec = EJBContainer.createEJBContainer(); ctx = ec.getContext();
}
</code></pre>

<p>o I'm using JPA, so I need access to the PersistenceContext/EntityManager. Currently I look it up via:</p>

<pre><code>new InitialContext().lookup(""java:module/&lt;jax-rs resource name&gt;"");
</code></pre>

<p>But I've also seen:</p>

<pre><code>    emf = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory(""chapter02PU"");

<p>I've spend the last 8-9 months self teaching myself C# and I have come along pretty well, I can build my own small programs. I asked some people from various different places what my next step should be, they mostly said to learn ASP.NET, so thinking it was easy I didn't press for further information. A few days later I go to search for some tutorials/practice vids and information for ASP.NET to find out there's so many versions and different types that I had no idea where to begin. I've heard a lot about ASP.NET 3.5 I think it's called, but then lots of people are talking about something called ASP.NET MVC.</p>

<p>So finally to my question, for web related things, what version/type/name of ASP.NET do I need to learn? My guess is the ASP.NET 3.5, but I really want to be sure before I put months of learning into it.</p>

"9622346","<p>I've been using Hibernate for the last 5+ years both as JPA2 and using Hibernate's own sessions (ie: without JPA2 annotations).  I've been reading up on JDO as an alternate technology, and would like to use it in an upcoming project.</p>

<p>I've looked through the DataNucleus site as it would appear that DataNucleus is the RI for JDO.  What I would love to find, however, is some good documentation that can help me learn best practices for JDO coming from a JPA/hbm background.</p>

<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction?  I've searched for tutorials and the like, but I mostly find comparisons between the two, without actually getting into implementation details.  Ex: how to best structure DAOs, Models, queries, etc.  Does all that remain the same?  I'm assuming that some of the attraction towards JDO is more than just DB independence (ie: can work with both RDBMS and NoSQLs).  Consequently, I'm looking to leverage more of those advantages.</p>

<p>Also, it would appear that JDO (or at least the DataNucleus implementation) is based on byte-code enhancement rather than reflection (hibernate), which I can only assume speeds things up somewhat.</p>

<p>Are there any special techniques required to use JDO within a Spring app, or does one simply declare the DN PersistenceManager and TransactionManager as a Spring bean the same way one would with Hibernate?</p>

"9985257","<p>Here come a few newbie questions on using Cassandra with JSF 2.0. I'm in the start of a web application and want to use Cassandra as a backend. My app should be deployed in different regions and hence the same data should be available/replicated in/to all regions.</p>

<p>I would like to have general information about best practices.</p>

<p>I have the following setup:</p>

<ul>
<li>Maven2</li>
<li>JSF 2.0 (currently using Managed Beans and JPA)</li>
<li>Glassfish 3.2.1</li>
</ul>

<p>Which driver would you recommend?</p>

<ul>
<li>cassandra-jdbc driver implemented with datastax community edition?</li>
<li>Or Hector, which seems to be the most advanced client?</li>
</ul>

<p>If Hector how would I use Hector properly within a JSF project?</p>

<ul>
<li>Hector JPA integration (could not find any information on how to use)?</li>
<li>Using Hector directly from Managed Beans without JPA?</li>
</ul>

<p>How would I use the driver best in a JSF 2.0 web application?</p>

<li>Singleton Bean?</li>
<li>POJOs?</li>
</ul>

"10054653","<p>I want to learn how to be able to use the Win32 API, since recently I've got a lot of tasks I need to do which requires functions from <code>user32.dll</code>, so I'm trying to learn and I Googled but the thing is: every tutorial there is about it, just tells you how to do a certain thing. like show a <code>MessageBox</code> through the Win32 API, but you can't actually learn Win32 framework.</p>

<p>So how do you actually learn it? How do you know all the functions? with managed libraries it's quite easy, especially with Visual Studio which provides IntelliSense, the Object Browser etc. but the Win32 API is so messy (at least from a C# developer standpoint).</p>

"10535576","<p>I've been trying to learn Python for about 6 weeks now. After reading a lot about TDD on this site I bought <em>The Art of Unit Testing</em> by Roy Osherove (great book!) to try and experiment with TDD while also learning Python. The book uses .NET but it doesn't seem to be a problem. Stubs are stubs, and mocks are mocks.</p>

<p>While I'm reading, and seeing TDD examples online, I really feel like I understand why the coder wrote the code as they did. But as soon as I sit down and try myself, I get nowhere.</p>

<p>Let me give you an example from yesterday:</p>

<p>I wanted to try TDD for a not-so-complicated project. Basically, what I want is a class that, by downloading and parsing an RSS feed, holds a list of tuples containing (name, date). I created a new py-file for my tests (no ""real code"" written yet) and wrote a test case:</p>

<pre><code>import unittest

from tv_schedule import TvSchedule

class TvScheduleTests(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_download_success_and_parse_failure(self):
        '''Successfully download RSS schedule for the specific user
           but fail parsing it'''
        self.tv = TvSchedule(""User123"")
        # Check if ParserException was thrown I guess


if __name__ == ""__main__"":
    unittest.main()
</code></pre>

<p>...and then I'm kind of stuck. I think (lol!). I really need some pointers on if this is just stupid and/or how I could do this better. My intuition says that I've done something bad.</p>

<p>I'd like to let the TvSchedule class do the downloading/parsing in the background (using <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/RssLibraries"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""feedparser"">feedparser</a>) so you just create a new instance of the class and then just use it. Maybe this is bad design and also making it hard to test? Also, how would I remove the dependency on retrieving the rss feed over the network? By stubbing it and always return an in-memory string containing a sample feed?</p>

<p>As soon as I leave the really simple calculator examples that TDD tutorials and books love to use, I get stuck. :(</p>

<p>Now I am curious on how it works and how I might go about building a similar, low level plugin to heroku, possibly in another langauge. </p>

<p><strong>A brief summary of What the program does:</strong> </p>

<p>Basically, this ruby program :</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Automatically deploys my heroku every time I push to github</p></li>
<li><p>Is configured by only 4 parameters (the main one being the heroku API key). </p></li>
<li><p>Works perfectly right out of the box : required no specific mucking with heroku. I simply deployed this application as a new heroku app, and added the post recieve hooks to github, and then found that heroku was automatically building my application for me everytime I commited it to github. </p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My questions on how this ruby script (https://github.com/ajlai/github-heroku-pusher/blob/master/web.rb) is working to drive this github to heroku auto deploy service</strong> </p>

<ul>
<li><p>It appears to run a shell command.  Is that even allowed in heroku ?</p></li>
<li><p>Where is does the actual ""git pull"" from github occuring ? I see a ""GitPusher"" object, but its not clear where that object is defined (I suspect that is it a ruby gem object that is statically imported into the class, but I don't see what gem it might come from). </p></li>
<li><p>I'm wondering where the brave soul who built this project found the documentation necessary for building such a low-level hook for Heroku.  Any hints as to how I could go about building custom worker hooks (preferably in a language other than Ruby) of the same ilk would be appreciated. </p></li>

"11224873","<p>I recently started to use Java for work, but I am mostly doing it using my early knowledge about java 1.4. I am aware that there are a great number of new Java features (which I know some, but not thorough enough). 
What is the most effective way to learn those new features, instead of reading those fundamental books with a lot of content I already know. </p>

"11228099","<p>Basically I need your advice my good stack friends :D</p>

<p>For the last six months I am exploring/learning/developing iOS apps with <a href=""http://www.appcelerator.com/"">Titanium Appcelerator</a> mobile framework. My experiences are mostly good or very good.</p>

<p><strong>Some negative parts</strong> of Titanium would be building time, especially when testing on a device. When using only Xcode (native), your app starts immediately on a device, while with Titanium you have to wait for a while (1-2 minutes) for your app to build and then to install it on a device (iTunes or iPhone Configuration Utility). </p>

<p>Basically everything that you can do natively you can do with Javascript + Titanium. If Titanium does not support some part of iOS framework, you can build a native Objective-C module and have those features in your Javascript code.</p>

<p>I feel really comfortable now using Titanium Appcelerator and building apps with Javascript. Also I learned some Objective-C while building a few modules for iOS. Eg. <a href=""https://github.com/Dino4674/Movement"">DeviceMotion</a> which I used in my first iOS app <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id517057897"">Spellery</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Now the question</strong>:</p>

<p>Most companies wants only native developers and are sceptic of Titanium. Titanium is different from other cross platform SDKs (Eg. PhoneGap) because here you actually use native components (buttons, labels etc) and your app is not running in a WebView. But if company wants native then you can't force them to use Titanium.</p>

<p>Since I would like to develop mobile apps as a job, should I just throw my last six months of intensive exploring of Titanium and learn programming those apps natively?</p>

<p>What are your thoughts on this because I see no point in learning/perfecting both of them?</p>

<p>I am a very big fan of Appcelerator Titanium now so this is a very heavy decision to make.</p>

"11501657","<p>This might sound like a silly question, because if you Google <code>""OOPS""</code> or <code>""OOPS in C#""</code> you get tons of results. But.<br>
I am aware of concepts of <code>OOP</code> like <code>abstraction</code>, <code>inheritance</code> and what not... But what I want to see is some ""<strong><em>practical usable example</em></strong>"" of it in programming. Like for <code>polymorphism</code>  you know a practical example is <code>Object.GetType</code> etc.  </p>

<p>Some times if not many, I find myself doing something like at a button click open a connection and do some stuff, this is not <code>OOP</code> oriented from what I know, I should have a particular entity/class, and it should have a method for the stuff I am doing at button click, and then I should call that method, instead of doing all the stuff at button click.  </p>

<p>Another example is that I just found myself loading all the projects that a employee works on, at <code>the txtEmployeeName.Leave</code> event and then fill the combo for the projects. This is not OOP oriented either, I should have class <code>Employee</code>, and a method in that which loads all the projects this employee works on, and then I should call that method at <code>txtEmployeeName.Leave</code>.</p>

<p>When I find or read somewhere (online or whatever) I see things like, <code>Vehicle</code> is a abstract class, and <code>Car</code> is a <code>Vehicle</code>, so it inhered from <code>Vehicle</code>, and this is <code>Inheritance</code>. We all understand that, but that's not a practical thing. Another example I found, that if we have a method <code>MakeSound</code>, and we call it an object <code>Cat</code>, it will <code>Purr</code>, but if we call the same method on <code>Dog</code>, it will <code>Bark</code>, this is <code>Polymorphism</code>.</p>

<p>Its good for understanding, but its not ""<em>practical</em>"" or you should rather say ""<em>real programming example</em>"". <strong>So what I need to know is that are there any good resources (online, books or whatever) where I can read about OOP but not like in exaples I gave in previous paragraph, but some ""real world programming example"" that would actually have me make my code more OO?</strong> </p>

However, my goal is to be able to develop WinRT applications ( using C# ) and I have already noticed some differences between WinRT ( WPF 4.5? ) and WPF 4 which is discussed in the book, such as WinRT doesn't have a DockPanel or Label controls and there is a some code in App.xaml.cs that basic WPF4 applications doesn't have.</p>

<p>So, I am just wondering if there are some other major differences between WinRT and normal WPF4 applications and if I should find a tutorial or a book which is about WinRT specifically ( by the way, feel free to suggest one ).</p>

"11597928","<p>I understand this question has been asked before, but I couldn't think of a simple definition of my problem to put in it's place.  I am learning to do this informally, so I'm not exactly sure how to phrase questions/search for answers yet.</p>

<p>I'm trying to build a simple checklist program as I learn javascript - I'm doing this by hand without using any libraries (so no jQuery, just basic javascript).  I have a functioning DOM interface getting formatted by CSS, all running in and editing the contents of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, so that side of things seems fine.<br>
I'm testing this off of my HDD and have no intention of hosting it anywhere.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm trying to solve my data storage problem without installing php/mysql/apache.  I'd like to have each task list nested ""subtasks"" when selected, with one level of nesting.<br>
To do this I'd like to create a new XML file every time I create a new task, and then append it's information to a list file (list.xml) so that I can navigate list.xml to dynamically display all the current primary tasks.<br>
I've since learned that you cannot simply create new .xml files with javascript alone, for security reasons.  While this makes sense, I'm now looking for other solutions.</p>

<p>What is the simplest way to store this information as it's entered?  One solution I've considered is having just one XML file (so I always know what to point the script to), and using ""<code>&lt;id&gt;</code>"" nodes to slave subtasks to their respective primaries.  This would, however, create a very long and disorganized XML file that would become cumbersome and annoying to traverse, forcing me to write a tricky method for looping through it.  </p>

<p>Should I continue as I am to simply complete the project and help lock in my skills (it will be my first complete ""program"" with a gui of any kind that wasn't dictated by a guide or lesson), or should I bite the bullet and go through the annoying php install (I did this on my last tower and it was a frustrating time-consuming mess) and learn php/mysql/apache for all the server-side nonsense?</p>

"11639684","<p>Right now I'm watching the Stanford's channel in youtube, and to be precise I'm watching the Java lectures by Professor Mehran Sahami. I already have some level of theoretical knowledge of Java but I find these lectures very interesting but there's one thing that confuses me and I want to clarify it before going any further.</p>

<p>In the examples there are a lot of differences from what I've seen so far in the books I've read and even in the original documentation of Sun. In these lectures the main method is as it seems <code>public void run()</code> insted of <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>. For console output he uses only <code>println()</code> instead <code>System.out.println()</code> and I suggest that going more deeply into the Java language there will be even more differencies from what I would call ""the standard syntax.""</p>

<p>From what I understand all this come from using the ACM package and I really don't know if keep watchng this will help me or just gonna confuse me more. Is this ACM package of some practical use? Does it make the Java syntax a lot more different than usual so I could end up with bunch of useless commands? Do you think it would be better to leave these videos for now and come back later when I can get use of the useful information and be more aware of the outdated stuff or the difference is not that big?</p>

<p>The above sets the second element of the vector a to the string 'a'.</p>

<p>The above constructs a vector from 3 to 9 with the step 2.</p>

<p>The above constructs a vector from 5 to 15 with the step 3.</p>

<p><code>t=0:0.05:10;</code></p>

<p>t becomes a vector between 0 and 10 with increments of 0.05. </p>

<p><code>f=t.*exp(2*t);</code></p>

<p>This is just like a regular function definition.</p>

I realize that one is a scripting language and the other is not, but my question is: for someone with my experience would this be too confusing? Or will I be fine learning them both at the same time?</p>

"11973090","<p>What are good ways to learn Android testing?
I'm interested in learning Android testing, I don't actually do TDD but write the tests and code together.</p>

<p>I read all the information at <a href=""http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/index.html"">http://developer.android.com/tools/testing/index.html</a>
and the 'Android Application Testing Guide' book and understand the basic concepts but there is almost no information or examples out there that I can find.</p>

<p>the book and examples are very basic and showing how to test a pretty simple activity with 2 EditText boxes,</p>

<p>I need to test more complicated stuff such as IntentService, AsyncTask, ResultReceiver, etc.. I'm interested in building my apps in a TDD or almost TDD way.</p>

<p>is there any way I can learn those things (books, blogs, examples, ...) or Android testing is something very uncommon ?</p>

"11994232","<p>I looked but an answer to this doesn't seem to be coming up...it appears that the window.fbAsyncInit in my js file isn't being called. This is a test app to familiarize myself with the API so pretty basic and is why the PHP snippit is in the HTML portion ;). A thought I had was the JS couldn't see the fb-root DIV so I tried loading the JS after and even stripped out everything except the Facebook stuff and still nothing...neither the innerHTML for the info DIV nor the console show anything. I do get the ""SDK loaded"" message in the DIV and console so I know the API is loading. I'm also not getting any errors. Does anyone have any ideas as to why this isn't working? Also tried FF, Chrome, Safari and IE (mac and pc) with the same result.<br><br>

"12063895","<p>**edit</p>

<p>What site/article/book would be a good place getting started writing software for servers to be accessed and controlled via web pages?</p>

<p>Apparently I didn't ask a real question in the beginning or something so I just asked a really simple question and if you want more details like what platform or languages would be preferable see below.</p>

<p>** original</p>

<p>First off I'm alright at programming. Just alright, I know how to use loops, text manipulation, arrays, etc. however I have only ever written applications that either a) sit in an html file and ajax call a server or b) send simple bytes to a server over a tcp socket. I've never written the server software that responds though.</p>

<p>I'd like to know where a good place would be to learn how to write the server software so that programs like this can send and receive information to and from. I have experience with python, java, and javascript as well as some bash.</p>

<p>I'm talking I lack the very basic tools of understanding here. For instance where do I put the files on the server so that I can make an ajax call to them? Do they all go into the cgi-bin or should those only be the gateways that forward information to a backend that isn't publicly accessible? </p>

<p>Basically I'm looking for a book or some articles that will teach me the very basics so that I can pick up on what most programmers think is a given when talking about this kind of server application. Preferably with a focus on making a back end for web applications using javascript.</p>

<p>I will most likely write the application backend in python as I find it is the fastest to develop on and I've been meaning to try out django if that makes a difference. (Reasons to use java over python would be cool if you find one better than the other for this)</p>

<p>Also it will be written on a Linux Amazon ec2 server.</p>

<p>I'm not asking you to explain it to me (although that would be nice of you if you did) I just want a good place to get started.</p>

<p>Thanks for any replies.</p>

"12076830","<p>I asked this the other day but it was closed, probably because I have a tendency to ramble so I'll get straight to the question.</p>

<p>I've written programs before so I'm not looking for an introduction to programming.</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone had a good site/article/book that they think would be a good introduction to designing a server application.</p>

<p>The server will be a linux based amazon ec2 server with apache. I would prefer to use python, I know Java as well though if you think that would be a better programming language for server technology. It will be accessed over the internet via a web browser. </p>

<p>Again, does anyone know of a good site/article/book that they think would be a good introduction to designing a server application?</p>

<p>**Edit</p>

<p>The end application will be for use with a web browser to access via ajax to return information from a database/maintain a database and add/delete files from the server. Right now though I'm just looking to write a simple app that will take an ajax call, do something simple with it, and return the manipulated data.</p>

<p>**Edit</p>

<p>For starters I would like to just integrate with a static HTML page that uses javascript to ajax and update the HTML. Later I'll move onto creating the pages dynamically based on database information and templates with ajax calls to have the server update a database when I get more comfortable.</p>

<p>**Final Edit</p>

<p>Ok, for all the people who voted to close this. Where in your mind is ""where is a good place to start learning to write a server application"" not a straightforward or vague question? Seriously it isn't vague or unanswerable. The only way it would be overly broad is if you assume that when I ask about learning how to write a server application you are assuming that I already have a working knowledge of how server applications work and just left out what should be assumed to your elite hacker mind as given. To summarize, you had to learn about server application theory somewhere. All I'm asking is where (outside of school) and how can I learn the same thing.</p>

<p>Outside of those guys thank you all for providing the information I was looking for. It changed my thinking about how applications run on servers and gave me some insights.</p>

<h3>What MCU should I choose?</h3>

<h3>Emulator</h3>

moment, but would like to be able to do some basic testing.</p>

<h3>Flashing</h3>

<p>I have a friend that helps out with the PCB, he and I would like to know, how
does one program such an MCU? Is there something similar to AVR's ISP or is it
done trough JTAG?</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Edit</strong>: I forgot to mention, I have an mbed with an LPC1768 on it, but I don't
like the mbed compiler. Is it wise to practice on that until I get a board with
an Cortex M0 on it?</p>

"12290358","<p>I am a 16 year Windows UI developer and am now researching Network Programming on Embedded Devices.  This is completely out of my realm of expertise.  I need to research network programming on 2 devices:</p>

<p>Device 1 will use Windows Embedded Compact 7 (WEC7) as its operating system.  It will need to auto-configure its network (plug and play) so that it can connect to Device 2 via Ethernet.</p>

<p>Device 2 will act as a switch to connect Device 1 with a PC or LAN.  Device 2 will use our custom operating system and will have 2 Ethernet ports.  We need to write our network code on that system from the ground up.</p>

<p>We want Device 1 and Device 2 to auto-configure themselves so the user doesn't have to do any configuration of the network.  They should just plug and play.</p>

"12327878","<p>In my class we have an assignment and one of the questions states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Memory fragmentation in C: Design, implement, and run a C-program that does the following: it allocated memory for a sequence of of 3m arrays of size 500000 elements each; then it deallocates all even-numbered arrays and allocates a sequence of m arrays of size 700000 elements each. Measure the amounts of time your program requires for the allocations of the first sequence and for the second sequence. Choose m so that you exhaust all of the main memory available to your program. Explain your timings</p>

<p>I have changed this up a few different ways, but the consistencies I see are that when I initially allocate the memory for 3*m*500000 element arrays it uses up all of the available main memory. But then when I tell it to free them the memory is not released back to the OS so then when it goes to allocate the m*700000 element arrays it does it in the page file (swap memory) so it does not actually display memory fragmentation.</p>

<p>The above code runs this 1000 times and averages it, it takes quite some time. The first sequence average took 2.06913 seconds and the second sequence took 0.67594 seconds. To me the second sequence is supposed to take longer to show how fragmentation works, but because of the swap being used this does not occur. Is there a way around this or am I wrong in my assumption?</p>

"12552027","<p>Although I am not a Perl guru, I use Perl and I can write object-oriented programs the ""good old"" way.</p>

<p>Now I would like to learn Moose. I've already (so-as) chewed the basic documentation, and my first Moose and roles are already working, but I'm miles away from understanding how Moose actually works.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1: Is it absolutely necessary to understand how Moose works to write ""pretty good"" programs?</strong></p>

<p>Honestly, I don't quite understand the old object system. Something I vaguely remember reading is that it's actually a reference to a data structure, but I never explored deeper. It was sufficient for me to know how and when I needed to use <code>bless</code>, <code>autoload</code> etc. and things simply worked. Maybe some of my old modules can be written more effectively. But for me, they work and work well.</p>

<p>Is this similar to Moose? Or does someone writing ""enough-good"" programs with Moose need to understand how it works ""inside""?</p>

<p>The question arises for the following reasons:</p>

<p>In the METACPAN are dozens of modules that help write Moose objects even more easier and simpler.</p>

<p>Examples at random:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::StrictConstructor"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::StrictConstructor</a> (ok, easy to understand)</li>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::HasDefaults"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::HasDefaults</a> (ok, easy)</li>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/Method::Signatures::Simple"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/Method::Signatures::Simple</a> (bump! haven't idea what are the signatures, and this Module is the ""easy"" one.)</li>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AlwaysCoerce"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AlwaysCoerce</a> /hmm.... :(/</li>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::LazyRequire"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::LazyRequire</a> /hmm... :(/</li>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AbstractMethod"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AbstractMethod</a> </li>
<li><a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AttributeShortcuts"" rel=""nofollow"">https://metacpan.org/module/MooseX::AttributeShortcuts</a> (Shorthand for common attribute options - so probably it is a helper - but, is it really useful to learn?)</li>
</ul>

<p>and many-many more (don't want cite here another 10-20 modules)</p>

<p>And now the main question:</p>

<p>Are there any good books with the instructions, examples and recommendations (good practices) for:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>what</strong> from the above listed <strong>modules are recommended to use routinely from the start</strong>?</li>
</ul>

<p>The above modules were surely not developed only because the author just hasn't what to do. Certainly they are useful and helpful. But learning (read: trying to understand) tens of many different modules (especially those who play with Moose internals) is an extremely long process. On the other hand, if they are not used, my programs will be unnecessarily complicated, and I will be dealing with things already resolved.</p>

<p>Moose should be (and probably is) a revolutionary system. Only I'm starting getting lost.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just found <a href=""https://metacpan.org/module/Reindeer"" rel=""nofollow"">Reindeer</a>. Probably this module is a partial answer to the question:
<strong>what modules are useful to use from the start (or most of time)</strong></p>

<p>PS: I'm not sure than this question is ok for SO. If not, please move it to somewhere or close it. I asked it here because the SO-perl community is a really helpful place, and I don't know how to continue to learn Moose.</p>

"12662896","<p>I am now several months into learning <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/"">F#</a> with the greatest asset for learning F# being translating the <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/"">OCaml</a> code in ""<a href=""http://www.cambridge.org/gb/knowledge/isbn/item2327697/?site_locale=en_GB"">Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning</a>"" (<a href=""http://www.worldcat.org/title/handbook-of-practical-logic-and-automated-reasoning/oclc/408024373&amp;referer=brief_results"">WorldCat</a>) by John Harrison, into F#. </p>

<p>With this being such an effective method of learning, I plan to translate the code in more books to F#, but books primarily focused on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming#Concepts"">functional concepts</a> or <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/realworld/"">real world applications</a> typically known for being written with a functional language such as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence"">AI</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler"">compilers</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_theorem_proving"">Theorem Provers</a> and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_assistant"">Reasoning Assistants</a>.</p>

<p>While one would think that translating a program from one language to another might be a trivial task, in reality when doing such one runs into differences not only in the language but the environment and tools that must also be learnt and understood to do the translation. One is required to explore the depths of both languages and their environments that are not typically considered when just reading about it. For example in translating Ocaml to F# I learned <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml-4.00/manual023.html"">top-level</a>, <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/manual030.html"">ocamldebug</a> and time travel, <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/resources/doc/guides/debug.en.html"">trace</a> and wishing F# had this, <a href=""http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/tutorial-camlp4/index.html"">camlp4</a> and how it doesn't exist in F#, <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12160390/ocaml-performance-of-exceptions"">exception handling performance differences</a>, and <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12341767/converting-ocaml-to-f-differences-between-typing-and-type-inference"">type inference</a> in a manner that forced me to understand the F# counterparts in ways I would not have by just experimenting or reading books with F#.</p>

<p>Do you know of any other books that use/include source code, preferably functional, that cover concept(s) of functional programming or are real world applications typically written in a functional language and that will help in learning functional programming by translating the source code to F#?</p>

<p>To keep this objective and not subjective, the answers must explain why it is important, and you must have used the book not just browsed the book. I am looking for answers from people who have been doing functional programming for years and have found working through such a book a key to their success with functional programming.

"12869910","<p>I have a small routing engine. It matches patterns and populates a dictionary of route-parameters. So <code>/blog/{action}/{id}</code> will match <code>/blog/view/123</code> and put <code>123</code> as the value to the key of <code>id</code> in a dictionary and so on. </p>

{
    [RouteParam(""action"")]

    [RouteParam(""id"")]

<p>How would I get started doing this? I've not used reflection hardly at all(though oddly very familiar with IL) and it seems a bit daunting and I'm afraid of doing it in a sub-optimal way since this is a bit performance critical.

<p>Later, I've been using Visual C++ for my research, building algorithms for my problems and so on. I am not able to create any GUI and I don't use objects but a classical procedural perspective, so in fact I use C with some characteristics from C++.</p>

<p>There was a moment when I tried to learn Python. It seemed so <em>friendly</em>, fresh, interesting, simple but powerful...  But at the end, I was a little bit confused, because of many different reasons, for example:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I was used to procedural languages, and Python is functional oriented, a little bit at least.</p></li>
<li><p>I was used to languages that can create <code>.exe</code> files (<em>compiled</em>), and Python is <em>interpreted</em>. Also, I learnt that for that reason C is ---generally speaking--- faster than Pyhton, when we talk about creating complex algorithms and so on.</p></li>
<li><p>There are different versions of Python, all of them stable and up-to-date! I mean, there is Python 2.x, and Python 3.x. And there are things that work in version 3 but not in version 2, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Maybe this is even more subjective than the previous reasons, but I find more, better and more <em>stable</em> or <em>reliable</em> libraries in C than in Python.</p></li>
<li><p>Also, I found it a bit difficult to choose between different GUIs for Python programming and different <em>flavors</em>, as Python IDE, Tkinter, IronPython...</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I <em>do</em> think that Python is a powerful language despite being interpreted. And also I still think it is more <em>beautiful</em> than C. I like Python, but I would like that I liked more!</p>

<p>So, finally, my question is, how can I truly learn and master Python, in a <em>sure</em> way, so that I am able to use it as my <em>main</em> choice for programming mathematical algorithms?</p>

<p>When I say <em>""sure""</em>, I mean, which are (in your opinion) the safest path and tools for learning and using Python in a reliable way?, which are the more mature and stable libraries, GUIs, and so on?</p>

<p>Sorry if this question is a little bit strange, but I guess there could be more people with the same kind of doubts about Python as me.</p>

"13103126","<p>I come from an engineering background but not a very good programmer and I managed to google some php login scripts and combine it with ajax/jquery to hack together a decent login script.  I also found a few commenting scripts that I plan on modifying.  If I am simply trying to create a website that won't be any more complicated than a site like formspring.me, would it be worth re-doing what I have with CakePHP?  I've read a little bit about frameworks, but it seems like there would be a bit of ramp up time for me.  Seems like the time I use to ramp up with cakephp would be similar to the time used to modify other php scripts I find online.  It also doesn't seem like CakePHP has commenting modules that I could simply plug and use right off the bat, so I would end up creating/making my own anyway.</p>

<p>For my purposes (creating a relatively straight forward site like formspring.me), would it be worth investing the time to learn/use CakePHP? </p>

<p>Any thoughts would help!</p>

"13127212","<p>I've asked a similar question before, about how to write an emulator, and when I saw the answers and looked up some open source gameboy emulators, I found that there was much more needed than an intermediate understanding of a ""low level"" language (i.e. C). What I actually want to know is, what do I need to know about HARDWARE to be able to program such an emulator. I'm closing in on being ""pretty good"" at Java, but that won't help me a lot. I've started learning C and I've come a long way now, but I'm interested in knowing what I have to study in hardware to be able to write such a console emulator. </p>

<p>The reason I'm asking this question is that I've been searching around the internet for books and sources on emulation, and whenever I come across an emulator tutorial, it's always like ""you need a basic understanding of C to be able to follow this tutorial"" and when I try to follow it I can't, simply because I don't know what the hell is being programmed. I've never known anything in the slightest about hardware. (my dad who struggles to connect his monitor to his PC probably knows more about it)</p>

<p>So my question is, what do I need to study (microprocessors, memory, etc?) and are there any good sources for this that can teach me about this stuff without me having to go to college for it or something (already doing software engineering)? </p>

<p>I apologize if this is not a real question, or not clear enough, or anything like that. I am just very interested in the subject. </p>

"13221044","<p>This is a supervised learning problem.</p>

<p>I have a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Each edge has a vector of features X, and each node (vertex) has a label 0 or 1. The task is to find a cost function w(X), so that the shortest path between any pair of nodes has the highest ratio of 1s to 0s (minimum classification error).</p>

<p>The solution must generalize well. I tried logistic regression, and the learned logistic function predicts fairly well the label of a node giving the features of a incoming edge. However, the graph's topology is not taken into account by that approach, so the solution in the whole graph is non-optimal. In other words, the logistic function is not a good weight function given the problem setup above.</p>

<p>Although my problem setup is not the typical binary classification problem setup, here is a good intro to it:
<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning#How_supervised_learning_algorithms_work"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning#How_supervised_learning_algorithms_work</a></p>

<p>Here are some more details:</p>

<ol>
<li>Each feature vector X is a d-dimensional list of real numbers. </li>
<li>Each edge has a vector of features. That is, given the set of edges E = {e1, e2, .. en} and set of feature vectors F = {X1, X2 ... Xn}, then edge ei is associated to vector Xi.</li>
<li>It is possible to come up with a function f(X), so that f(Xi)
gives the likelihood that edge ei points to a node labeled with a 1.
An example of such function is the one I mentioned above, found through logistic
regression. However, as I mentioned above, such function is non-optimal. </li>
</ol>

<p>SO THE QUESTION IS:
Given the graph, a starting node and an finish node, how do I learn the optimal cost function w(X), so that the ratio of nodes 1s to 0s is maximized (minimum classification error)?</p>

<p>This is only part of the code obviously, and as of right now I get a segmentation fault after I enter a name into the add name function. It loops to the menu one last time before quitting.

<p>I have experience only in making small simple apps in PHP, Java and ASP.NET. I had no idea what GET, SET etc <strong>exactly</strong> are and what REST services are. To try to use the Twitter API, I did some reading and got to know (I might be wrong here, because this is what I THINK that I know..) that you can make a GET request like this one:
<a href=""http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json"" rel=""nofollow"">http://api.twitter.com/1/statuses/user_timeline.json</a></p>

<p>Using, say, cURL (I haven't tried it yet), and you get a JSON object returned which contains the statuses on your timeline in a certain format. And I verified this from <a href=""https://dev.twitter.com/console"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a></p>

<p>But I don't understand how does Twitter know that it is ME and return only MY data? Where am I sending my account details?</p>

<p>What I want is for the use to come to my website, click a button to give my application the permission to access his/her Tweets and I do some processing in PHP and display the output. But I don't know where do I start from?</p>

<p>I am not asking you to give me bread, I'm asking you to tell me what should I do to learn to fish?</p>

"13774286","<p>I am almost finished with this game I have been making. It is a toy app and is only serving to teach me. So I call it toyapp. </p>

<p>I am trying to use what I learned about alarmmanager, intent, and broadcast to kill my application. I figured out how to get my alarm to go 10 seconds and then print a message to a widget. This was based on the following tutorial <a href=""http://justcallmebrian.com/?p=129"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. </p>

<p>It was my thinking that I could just call this up, warn the user I am about to kill this application and then close it out. However, it appears that the AlarmReceiver is not being called at all? My game just keeps playing. </p>

<p>The code I have modified is below for my toyapp. </p>

<pre><code>public void timingService(Context context, Activity activity){
    // get a Calendar object with current time
     Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();

 // add 5 minutes to the calendar object
 cal.add(Calendar.SECOND, 5);

 Intent intent = new Intent(context, AlarmReciever.class);
 intent.putExtra(""alarm_message"", ""Game will exit soon"");


 // In reality, you would want to have a static variable for the request code instead of 192837
 PendingIntent sender = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 192837, intent, PendingIntent.FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT);

 // Get the AlarmManager service
 AlarmManager am = (AlarmManager) activity.getSystemService(context.ALARM_SERVICE);
 am.set(AlarmManager.RTC_WAKEUP, cal.getTimeInMillis(), sender);

}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, put my Receiver code in my activity class. Which is as follows: </p>

<pre><code>public class AlarmReciever extends BroadcastReceiver{


        @Override
        public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
            try{
                Bundle bundle = intent.getExtras();
                String message = bundle.getString(""alarm_message"");
                Toast.makeText(context, message, Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show(); //Give message
                toyappActivity.this.finish(); //Exit the game

            }catch(Exception e){
                Toast.makeText(context, ""There was an error somewhere"", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

        }


    }//End of AlarmReciever
</code></pre>

<p>My inspiration for this approach was the following that I read <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10750034/kill-application"">here</a>. </p>

<p>What I eventually want to do is simple. I will have an option to play the game with or without the alarm. I plan on reseting the alarmmanager with the accelerometer sensor if movement is detected. Otherwise, it will just countdown and then cancel the game. </p>

<p>I suspect I am not understanding intents directly, but this is my crashing point. I am so sorry if this seems stupid, but I have a rather bad cold right now and this seems like it should work to me. However, computers never lie, only our minds. </p>

<p>As always, you are all the best group of coders and developers. I learn so much from you all and your help is so much appreciated. Any dumb mistakes are my own, but I hope you let me off on that technicality. </p>

"13888146","<p>I am wondering how to go about making a custom control for an application. So far, all that I know is how to utilize the controls that Visual Studio gives me (i.e. combobox, button, etc.). So how do I go beyond this? (I am primarily developing for Windows Phone 8)</p>

<p>Take for instance the gear gauges in this screenshot below :</p>

<p>To continue with that example, how do I go about this? In OOP terms would this just be a matter of creating a ""Gauge"" class and making it inherit from a controls class and having the image be the gauge? What is a good resource to learn about how to go about this?</p>

"13923142","<p>I have seen in opensource projects by big companies on github that they do the simple programs in as small steps as possible.</p>

<p>They try to minimize the lines of code by using advanced methods, which make even the simple function calls appear complex.</p>

<p>How can I understand these things. It is not about advanced concepts, but doing simple things in efficient way, and that makes the code look hard to understand.</p>

<p>As an example this is the code of crawlerSpider from scrapy</p>

<pre><code>def identity(x):
    return x

class Rule(object):

    def __init__(self, link_extractor, callback=None, cb_kwargs=None, follow=None, process_links=None, process_request=identity):
        self.link_extractor = link_extractor
        self.callback = callback
        self.cb_kwargs = cb_kwargs or {}
        self.process_links = process_links
        self.process_request = process_request
        if follow is None:
            self.follow = False if callback else True
        else:
            self.follow = follow
</code></pre>

<p>This is where they used the rule</p>

<pre><code>rules = ()
for link in links:
                r = Request(url=link.url, callback=self._response_downloaded)
                r.meta.update(rule=n, link_text=link.text)
                yield rule.process_request(r)
</code></pre>

<p>Now I am not able to understand what is the use of <code>identity function</code> there its doing nothing</p>

<p>and <code>process_request = identity</code> so it means</p>

<p><code>rule.process_request(r) = identity(r)</code>  whcih returns <code>r</code> so basically that line equals to</p>

<p><code>yield r</code>. why can't he write that simple line instead of identity.</p>

<p>There are many things like this, which I am not able to comprehend.</p>

<p>Is there any book which explains writing programs that way. I don't like books where they start with data types go chapter by chapter and in the end I still don't see even a single program like we have on github.</p>

<p>then once <code>int 0x80</code> occurs, the kernel services the call. So what exactly must the kernel do to implement getuid? Somewhere there must be some code which runs after <code>int 0x80</code>.

"14666625","<p>I want to use the <code>capture</code> module of <code>org-mode</code> to create a data base of new words that I want to learn, and then use the <code>drill</code> module to learn them (flash cards style).</p>

<p>In my <code>org-capture-templates</code> I added the following:</p>

<pre><code>(""v"" ""Vocabulary"" entry
               (file+headline (concat org-directory ""/vocab.org"")
                              ""Vocabulary"")
               ""* Word :drill:\n%^ \n** Answer \n%^"")
</code></pre>

<p>This is a rather naive template which I borrowed <a href=""http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-09/msg00924.html"" rel=""nofollow"">from here</a>. It works fine but it is too limited. Unfortunately I'm rather new to <code>elisp</code> and I don't know how to improve it.</p>

<p>I think the above template has to be improved in the following there aspects:</p>

<p><strong>Headline</strong> Currently the first input string is the (new) word and the headline is fixed. How can the headline be the same (input) word? I think that the following result is desirable:</p>

<pre><code>* Vocabulary
** Foo :drill:
Foo
*** Answer
What is foo
</code></pre>

<p>Actually an even better way would be to have 3 input strings.</p>

<ol>
<li>The new word (for example <code>foo</code>) which will be the headline.</li>
<li>If the second is empty, then it gets the same string as (1). Otherwise, concatenates the string to the one from (1). E.g. having as second input <code>bar</code> would yield <code>foo bar</code>. This will be the content of the entry.</li>
<li>The word's definition which should come in the <code>answer</code> sub-headline.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Duplications</strong> (see again <a href=""http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-orgmode/2010-09/msg00924.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>) If at some later point I try to capture <code>foo</code> again, I would like to know it, and be directed to edit the already existing entry - skipping all the inputs.</p>

<p><strong>Sorting</strong> After capturing I think it would be nice to sort the list of words. This should not be too hard given that the headline of each entry is the word itself. In this case one can probably use the <code>org-sort-entries</code> function.</p>

<p>I know this is a rather big questions but I also think that if it can be solved here it will be of great use to many users.</p>

"14826424","<p>its my first post on stack so I'm excited for each answer.</p>

<p>I have a really big problem in choosing the right javascript framework. Just some personal information, I know the basics of javaScript, I can write jQuery and of course I know HTML5 and CSS3. But I want to jump into server side applications, as many others too, I guess. I'm reading since months in the web about all the different frameworks but it's just so complicated to decide for one. </p>

<p>Some days ago I started to try angularJs, but for some reason I didn't really understand it, as it goes deeper, because I don't really understand the documentation and as far as I searched, there are not much videocasts out there. I can learn much better with videos. </p>

<p>Then I switched to meteor.js but their documentation is even more complicated and there are also not much videos out there. While reading about meteor I headed over to node.js, because it was said, its easier understandable if I understand node.js. But until I understand node.js there is much time lost. I know I have to learn it, but I just want to start with a client side framework which easily connects then with node.js.</p>

<p>My basic intention for now is, just to start with a real basic todo app, just for myself to learn it and maybe add more and more features later. Some day I want to go on and try another app and another etc. It's a long way. But I can't choose a framework for it. I want something, which is pretty open to different use cases, wether its a small or a big app. Just in case for the future. But mostly when I'm reading about a framework, they also say something about commonJS, underscore.js etc. and it just confuses me, because I always think I have to learn all that stuff. </p>

<p>So what's the best way to start? Should I just go back to Angular and try it further? Should I just try to write it on my own and look into the docs when I need something, or should I read the complete doc first? Same for meteor. And I also have backbone always in my mind, if its maybe a better one. This area is so overwhelming to start, so what's your experience? How did you start and whats the best way? I dont want to loose more time for senseless reading with no decision. </p>

"14902732","<p>I'm quite new to Python. I've downloaded the Pyramid Framework and have been trying to understand it. It uses many separate tools for its work. For example some <code>PasteDeploy</code>. I tried to read <a href=""http://pythonpaste.org/deploy/"" rel=""nofollow""><code>PasteDeploy</code>'s manual</a> but can't understand anything. There is almost no valuable examples and explanation. Just syntax. All I understood is that it uses <code>.egg</code> format everywhere. It is based on <code>.egg</code> format:</p>

<pre><code>[composite:main]
use = egg:Paste#urlmap

[app:home]
use = egg:Paste#static

[app:blogapp]
use = egg:BlogApp
</code></pre>

<p>At the same time I found that <code>.egg</code> format is going to be thrown away from Python's package's future. Here's <a href=""http://guide.python-distribute.org/future.html"" rel=""nofollow"">the source</a>.
And also at the same time the Pyramid is built around <code>eggs</code> too. Every component in its <code>env\Lib\site-packages</code> is an <code>egg</code> component:</p>

<pre><code>chameleon-2.11-py3.3.egg
distribute-0.6.31-py3.3.egg
pastedeploy-1.5.0-py3.3.egg
pyramid-1.4-py3.3.egg
... and so on
</code></pre>

<p>So I don't understand why it uses <code>.egg</code> format if it is considered as some sort of ""deprecated""? Why it uses <code>PasteDeploy</code> that itself uses almost deprecated <code>.egg</code> format? Should I learn <code>PasteDeploy</code> or there are some more progressive tools out there now but I don't know about them yet? Will <code>.egg</code> format be replaced in Pyramid in closest future? </p>

<p>I am thinking to let column be the citations, and the value to be 1 if that document has that citation. </p>

"15052183","<p>I know how to write some 100 lines C, but I do not know how to read/organize larger source like Rebol. Somewhere was a tutorial with hostkit and dll, but it seems R3 is now statically linked. So I do not know where to look.</p>

<p>How would I write a native which gets a value and returns another? Where to put it in the source? What to obey, like telling the GC I created something in C?</p>

<p>Also, how can I embed R3 in other programms, to call it from Python or Node? I ask for Python/Node part comes later. But my learning-main should access R3 in a similar way. Means dll. And are there some typical hooks for startup/shutdown etc in such ffi's?</p>

"15054397","<p>I have started learning Servlets, so I downloaded the apache tomcat 7.x zip file(core--> zip) from <a href=""http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. I extracted it to my directory (D:), then I have just set up the <code>JAVA_HOME</code> System variable to a value of <code>C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.6.0</code>(My computer is running on <strong>windows 7</strong> Home basic). </p>

<p>I have started up the server by <strong>startup.bat</strong> file in <code>bin</code> folder. When I just try to access <code>localhost:8080</code>, it always says <code>unable to connect</code> on the browser. So I changed the port number to <code>9999</code> in <strong>server.xml</strong> and restarted it. It again says unable to connect in my browser. When I start up the server it shows the following on the command shell. Can someone please help me solve this issue and make my server work? </p>

<p>By observing the following on the command shell, I could only find this line which seems to give some indication of the problem: <strong><code>Failed to initialize component [Standard Server[8005]]</code></strong>. I still don't know what it has to do with the unable to connect..</p>

"15292276","<p>I have recently been involved in using vectorization to improve performance of code segments which have a lot of inherent parallelism and along the way I have come across techniques/things-to-keep-in-mind like pointer aliasing, register spilling, cache blocking, CPU throttling, NUMA accesses, etc</p>

<p>However these have been mainly learnt in a scattered way, so my question is, to those who work in this domain, are there any comprehensive resources that you would suggest one should go through or one that have a good explanation of all these pitfalls/tricks in one place?</p>

<p>One resource that I have found useful is Ulrich Drepper's; ""What every programmer should know about memory"" and he has covered some such techniques in one section. So pointers to similar resources like this will be helpful for us who have just started in this field..</p>

"15307553","<p>I am not really new to Matplotlib.  I have made quite some figures with it, though I don't use it everyday (or every week, or even every month).  So I tend to forget some basic things, for example, how to add a legend, how to add a color bar, how to customize a colormap, how to change the font of a specific part of the figure, how to make some transparency effect, etc.  Of course, each time when I have a question, I can always google it and Google will most likely take me to stackoverflow or some other similar sites, or some blog articles, and I can almost always get a solution.  This gives me an impression that the ``official'' documentation is not as useful as it should be.</p>

<p>But I must be wrong, namely, the official documentation must be very useful, otherwise how do those people who answer the questions know the solutions?  Maybe they are ``insiders'' (developers of Matplotlib)?</p>

<p><strong>So my question is</strong>, in case you are not a developer (but you are welcome to answer this question if you are), and suppose you have answered many Matplotlib-related questions here, how do you learn those techniques by yourself without asking Google?  Where and how do you look for if the answer does not come to your mind immediately (not Google, because it is you who is answering that question, and before that maybe the answer does not exist in Google yet)?</p>

<p>Note that I am <em>not</em> complaining about the documentation.  I think I just haven't found an efficient way to make use of it.</p>

<p>Or maybe finding the solution to a specific request is inevitably not straightforward due to the intrinsic complexity of Matplotlib?  By intrinsic complexity, I mean in Matplotlib similar things can usually be done in many different ways, thus if one happens to choose one specific (and uncommon for whatever reasons) way in the beginning, and later comes across a problem, the solution to this problem may not have been listed explicitly in the manual, and maybe only those gurus who know how Matplotlib really works under the hood can come up with a solution.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To teach one how to fish is more helpful than to give one a fish.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: the specific problem I meet today is to add a color bar to a figure.  The slightly ``special'' thing in my case is that the main image is a collection of polygons, with the color of each one of them set individually.  So the simple colorbar function does not seem to work, at least not in a way as presented in the first Google result of ""matplotlib colorbar example"".  In this specific case it is indeed solved by the second Google result, but this is only discovered after many trials with the first Google result (and after searching with other keywords), which is kind of frustrating...  By the way, I used</p>

<pre><code>fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10,10))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, ...)
</code></pre>

<p>to set up the axis box (which is necessary because my polygons have to be added to a preexistent axis frame), so I have to use</p>

<pre><code>ax.xaxis.label.set_fontsize(20)
</code></pre>

<p>to change the font size of the xaxis label, which is only found out after quite some Googling.    How can I know by myself that ax has a property <em>xaxis</em>, <em>xaxis</em> has a property <em>label</em>, and <em>label</em> has a function <em>set_fontsize</em>, and the meaning of them when their names are not as obvious as here?</p>

"15354544","<p>I'll start off by saying that I'm an absolute beginner with ASP.NET MVC and have a very basic knowledge of web development.</p>

<p>I'm currently working on a website which will be very similar in functionality to MadMimi.com i.e it will allow basic email marketing with features like creating/editing/deleting lists, creating/editing/deleting audience members, composing/editing newsletters (plain text as well as HTML) and saving/scheduling/sending them; also some statistics will be provided to the admin.</p>

<p>I'm a one man army for this project with just a web designer at my disposal.</p>

<p>There are an awful lot of questions I have in my mind, to which I've been searching on the internet since almost a month and I could not get my queries resolved.</p>

<p>Here are some of them:</p>

<p>1) What should be the architecture of my solution? I mean, how many layers(projects) are good for this? (A web project, a database layer, a business layer etc)</p>

<p>2) What template should I use for my web project? An empty MVC project, a basic one or an internet application? (I will razor as my view engine) I will need to provide sign up/login/change password facilities, and I plan on storing the user credentials (password salt + generated hash) in a SQL Server 2008 R2 database. Since I'm new to web development, I really don't know anything about the ASP.NET built-in membership or things like that. Will someone guide me? Also, before allowing successful login, I will need a functionality to check if the user account is deleted &amp; disable &amp; verified. How can I implement this?</p>

<p>3) What controllers should I plan? What actually makes up a controller? Is it something like 'one controller per page'?</p>

<p>4) How will I implement Models? So far I've understood that one model class = one table in your database. Is it so? I plan on using Entity framework database first. I require a functionality to play with tables in code. By playing I mean, I want to do checking, calculaations, validations on fields, delete rows and after all editing is done save data back to the table.</p>

<p>5) How to implement twitter bootsrap in MVC? Are there any good alernatives to bootstrap? Is jqueryUI sufficient enough?</p>

<p>6) What are repositories? How to implement business logic layer? Will someone guide me? In all the books and videos (Pluralsight for example), they start with models, controllers, views, viewmodels, repositories, controller factories etc without even explaining why those things are needed and why should you need those.</p>

<p>7) What are the MVC specifics I must learn? I have heard things like dependency injection, view models, T4 templates, data annotations etc, but I don't seems to get why they're needed.</p>

<p>The situation is like I HAVE TO/MUST use MVC 4 for this project in any case. But this whole MVC thing is going over my head as there is noone to guide me. I'm the solo web developer in the company (others are android-iOS devs).</p>

<p>I know I sound like a total newbie and a totally confused soul but I would really very much appreciate if someone just guides me into MVC like what all things are there to learn, how should I go about learing, this-this-this features you must know if you want to be a MVC developer - things like that.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance to anyone who helps me.</p>

"15683760","<p>If I misuse or confuse the terms OpenID and OAuth, I apologize, I am still new to this whole decentralized login process.</p>

<p>I have been trying for days now to get my site (built in WebMatrix) to recognize a Google login. The problem is I need this line of code (from what I've researched) in my <code>_AppStart.cshtml</code> file:</p>

<pre><code>OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterGoogleClient();
</code></pre>

<p>But when I try to run this site after this statement is in place, I simply get a server error stating that <code>OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterGoogleClient();</code> does not exist in the current context.</p>

<p>I thought I might need the OAuth library, a different helper, or some other package, but the only relevant package I see (<em>Microsoft WebPages OAuth library 2.0.20710.0</em>) I can't get, because WebMatrix doesn't support the version of NuGet it says that I need (2.0).</p>

<p>I have never used this method for a log in before and I want to learn how as I build this functionality for my clients.  What I <strong>do not</strong> want to do is open up the starter template, and copy my files over. I have a problem using code that I don't understand. I feel that this would be a terrible habit for me to get into (it took some convincing myself before I would even use jQuery plug-ins).  It also might bear mentioning that I will not be using any other third party service for this login. We use gmail for our employees' company email accounts so I need <strong>only Google</strong> logins for this solution.</p>

<p>Things I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li>Googling for other scenarios like mine. <strong>Fails because no relevant search results are found (i.e., I am unable to find results that match my scenario)</strong></li>
<li>Searching for earlier versions of the <em>Microsoft WebPages OAuth library 2.0.20710.0</em> package. <strong>Fails because my search returns no such packages.</strong></li>
<li>Using <code>OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterOpenIDClient(BuiltInOpenIDClient.Google);</code> instead of <code>OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterGoogleClient();</code> <strong>Fails for the same reason as when using <code>OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterGoogleClient();</code></strong></li>
<li>Visiting Site Administration and downloading the OAuth Library.
<strong>Fails because NuGet needs an update</strong></li>
<li>Update Nuget <strong>Fails because of what is mentioned here (apparently, a known bug for WebMatrix):</strong> <a href=""http://forums.asp.net/t/1836913.aspx/1?Error+updating+DotNetOpenAuth+updates+with+NuGet+Gallery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.asp.net/t/1836913.aspx/1?Error+updating+DotNetOpenAuth+updates+with+NuGet+Gallery</a></li>
<li>Opening up the Starter Site Template, which already has OAuth built in and functional.<strong>Fails to teach me as to why this site recognizes <code>OAuthWebSecurity.RegisterGoogleClient()</code> and mine doesn't, because there is no clear way (that I am aware of) to tell what pacakages, updates, and/or versions of third party software might be different.</strong></li>
<li>Creating a new Starter Site and copying any OAuth based missing files from the *""App_Data""* and <em>""bin""</em> folders. <strong>Fails in that no behavioral changes were observed.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>-----------------------------------------<strong>UPDATE</strong>----------------------------------------</p>

<p>So far, to date, the best solution for this problem, at least for me, has been to just use the ""Starter Site"" template in WebMatrix, whether I like it or not.</p>

<p>One of my biggest worries for doing this, however, was that there were so many extraneous files that I wasn't sure what I could and couldn't delete to keep the site clean while still leaving the <code>OAuthWebSecurity()</code> class fully accessible and functional. I have, however kept only the ""bin"" and ""App_Data"" folders (including all of their contents, of course) from the ""Starter Site"" template and deleted everything else (including the web.config file) before moving my files over, and this has appeared to work very well for me, so far.</p>

<p>Using the above mentioned steps, I have kept my site clean of unnecessary code, while still having access to the <code>OAuthWebSecurity()</code> class.</p>

<p>In the future (I imagine when WebMatrix 3 is released) this bug will probably be fixed and a simple admin site install of the OAuth library will not require a version of NuGet that WebMatrix does not support, but until then, this has been the best answer for me.</p>

"15900696","<p>I am involved in building framework offering financial, non financial mobile services.</p>

<p>Underlying technology we are using is Spring 3.2 framework , especially Spring MVC.</p>

<p>Now Spring MVC offers many features by way of annotations.for example, to create controller just annotate class with <strong><em>@Controller</em></strong> annotation and you are done.besides this, there are many more things like handlers,adapters, exception resolver.</p>

<p>My question is.
As I already leveraged Spring framework and I know how to use Spring framework or customize by available hook points.and I might had did it but what about my framework users.</p>

<p>Should I create wrappers on above offerings by Spring so that my framework user does not need to know or learn Spring framework?</p>

<p>For example, Spring provides flexibility to register exception handlers to handle exceptions but for that we need to create bean entry for required exception handler and need to register in exception resolvers class and its his job to dig into Spring details to get idea how they have provided exception handlers and all those stuff.</p>

<p>He needs to do exactly same as I already did.</p>

<p>instead of that Should I provide some provision so that user just can define bean entry for their exception handler and register it in my framework provided registry, not in Spring provided bean class?| </p>

"15983521","<p>This is a serious question, I am ""stuck"" at this point between understanding it and not at all. I got very confused with the time reading different resources and would like someone to point me in the right direction.</p>

<p>I am working with Android platform, until now I have used the <code>Canvas</code>, some <code>OpenGL ES 1.0</code>, but mostly through engines or already built code to try and understand it. </p>

<p>My goal is to ACTUALLY understand <code>OpenGL ES 2.0</code>. I do not want to go straight to the complicated stuff and start with easy stuff, but I just don't get how to do it. I can get a square, and I can set up a camera and matrices; to tell you the truth I really don't understand the whole matrix system and how it works, if I am right it was a <em>fixed-function-pipeline</em> which you didn't need to change in <code>OpenGL ES 1.0</code> but now it's a <em>programmable-pipeline</em> which you have to set up on your own. </p>

<p>I do not get how to use the coordinate system, I know that the origin is the center of the device and each turn to the edge is 1, so from center to left it would be negative 1.</p>

<p>There were some ways however to make it into a different coordinate system, maybe just use proportions or multiply matrices to set the coordination to something that I was used to from the <code>Canvas</code>. </p>

<p>Basically what I need help with is how do I progress from here? I feel as if I got to somewhere, but I am still nowhere.</p>

<p>I really need some advises on how to properly use <code>OpenGL ES 2.0</code>, for now all I am planning on is a simple 2D game, maybe side scroll-er too so I will have to mess with the camera matrices.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time, I will greatly appreciate any help. </p>

<p>*I am less interested in the transformation matrices since I do not think that 2D game would really use that, maybe only when I mirror the character's sprite so it would look as if he is walking in a different direction, but I'm pretty sure this is possible to be made simple by changing the coordination and width.</p>

"16300014","<p>I recently started studying WebGL, and it's all very exciting. I really want to be able to code stuff on my own, but unfortunately, I have to rely a lot on libraries like three.js and matrix utility libraries to get anything done.</p>

<p>I have a strong JavaScript background, and I feel that if I could better understand the concepts behind WebGL (or OpenGL ES 2.0, for that matter), I could code all sorts of things without having to rely on so many libraries.</p>

<p>Some examples of things that confuse me are why people commonly use an MV matrix with a perspective matrix and combine them together to create the view you see, what exactly the frustum is and how to change it to get the intended view, as well as how to code some of the more complex things, like rotating 3D objects, etc.</p>

I enjoy coming up with ways to make the spreadsheet do what I want it to do, and then a friend suggested that I learn to code, since ""in principle"" it's the same thing. However, I am very much aware that it's NOT the same thing, so I tried learning from the very basic ""Beginning Programming for Dummies""... and yeah, ok - that was a bit TOO basic. But now I'm stuck in the middle: I want to learn coding as a hobby; I don't even know what I'd want a program to do, but I want to learn anyway - the ideas will come.

"16745594","<p>I'm almost completely new to programming (I've only made rudimentary maths programs in Python) so I would like to approach learning to program properly. In order to get proper advice, you need to know what I want to create.</p>

<p>Essentially it is a physics program that shows the decay chains and ratios of radioactive isotopes and their products. For example, the user selects Carbon-14 and a suitable time frame, presses go and sees the ratios of C-14 and its products change over time. What I would like for the output is a table of values, a couple of pie charts and the option to pause, play and stop the model.</p>

<p>The main meat of the program is the calculation. This should be relatively easy as it's simple number crunching (I could do that in Python now). What I need advice on is how to go about creating a user input (list of isotopes, chosen mass/number of atoms, time step, etc.), having that feed into the program, and having the resulting information being fed out and constantly updated in the form of pie charts/ tables.</p>

<p>I only have about 3 weeks (3-4 hours a day-ish) to go from nothing to finished working product. Visually, the final program needs to be functional above beautiful. I don't mind it looking a bit windows 95 (but it would be nice if it could be refined if I have time).</p>

<p>So, what programming language/software should I use? What additional stuff do I need for the input/output? How long do you think it will take?</p>

"16765496","<p>One thing I struggle with in learning Drupal is managing the output.  There's such an abstraction from the templating.  All the output -- all the templating, really -- is meant to be done from the interface.  You don't code markup, you place blocks and create views.  And you have to have the correct block or view for the specific output you want.</p>

<p>Contrast this to most other CMS, where you have some templating library and you're embedding tokens (or code -- actual or template-specific) in HTML markup.  There doesn't seem to be any of that in Drupal.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want a certain menu to appear for a certain content type.  Instead of having a template file for that type in which I just insert this menu, I'm instead finding a block that might output what I want, configuring the hell out of it (and hoping it configures how I want it),  placing it in a spot globally, then limiting it to just display for certain content types.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is a pretty huge departure from most other CMS.  As I said before, there really is no...templating.  It's all configuration, and as a developer, I find this really, really cumbersome. I'm navigating through all these admin screens, and trying to minutely configure a block, and all the time I'm thinking, ""If I could just get at the markup, I could solve this problem in 30 seconds...""</p>

<p>What's the solution to this alienation?  Do I just need to bite the bullet and embrace the philosophy?  Do I start writing my own themes -- would this take me back to a more familiar environment?  How do other developers coming from more ""traditonal"" templating environments handle this?</p>

<p>By powerful I mean >=32 bit processor with a clock rate of >=500MHZ and lots of internal RAM and flash.</p>

<p>The obvious first choice is Linux running on an ARM processor.  My perception of this path is that it is long and difficult, and running Linux typically requires external RAM and/or non volatile memory such as a flash drive, not to mention supporting hardware like a PMIC (power management IC).   All this supporting infrastructure is expensive.</p>

<li>For example, see the following random table:  <a href=""http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#Table-Random-Magic-Item-Generation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#Table-Random-Magic-Item-Generation</a>.  In a pen&amp;paper game, you would roll a d20 or d100 (two 10 sided dice) to create a random item used in the game.  This could take 3-5 minutes of time to roll the dice, and log the results.</li>
<li>When used in a larger context - this can be very time consuming.  For example, creating a random TOWN, full of random non-player characters that your PCs (player characters) might meet, full of random shops, which are in turn full of random items... it's a lot of random rolling &amp; manual storage!!</li>
<li>To clarify - my goal isn't to design a game, but instead a software application that can automate the process of generating content for pen&amp;paper games like Pathfinder that use random tables, and then SAVE that data for later viewing/modification.  For example:  <a href=""http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#Table-Random-Magic-Item-Generation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items#Table-Random-Magic-Item-Generation</a></li>

<p>I used to program back in the day's of dbaseIV and I now wish to get into building dynamic web apps.</p>

<p>So far I know I want to use GAE and Python but after researching frameworks, I'm a little confused to know which is the right one to choose in 2013? (Will it be supported tomorrow, is it too extensive for basic web apps? is there good documentation &amp; support?)</p>

<p>I'm thinking Webapp2 is the way to go and Jinja2?  HTML5's in there too but am I missing something else?</p>

<p>In fact, it would be awesome for people like me if someone could post a list of what a beginner needs to learn and in what order (e.g. 1. Learn HTML/CSS, 2. Learn Python, 3. Learn Webapp2 e.t.c).

"16920841","<p>I'm trying to grasp scala actors (I'm reading ""Scala for the Impatient"") and the following short example is not working like I intended. </p>

<p>I have case classes of messages I want to send to the actor:</p>

<pre><code>abstract class Message
case class Sum(x: Int, y: Int) extends Message
case class Stop() extends Message
</code></pre>

<p>And how the actor should process them:</p>

<pre><code>import scala.actors.Actor

class Adder(val idx: Int) extends Actor {

  def act() {
    while(true) {
      receive {
        case Sum(x: Int, y: Int) =&gt; println(""Total: "" + (x+y) + "", by "" + idx)
        case Stop =&gt; exit()
        case _ =&gt; println(""Wrong message sent to: "" + idx  + ""!"")
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the main object I create an Adder instance and send some messages:</p>

<pre><code>object Main extends App{
  val adder = new Adder(0)
  println(""Init"")
  adder ! ""Rafael""
  adder ! Sum(2, 3)
  adder ! Sum(5, 6)
  adder ! Stop()
  println(""goodbye!"")
}

<p>But the only outputs are the prints of ""Init"" and ""goodbye!"". I can't seem to find what's wrong with the code. I had some working actors before trying this one and just used the same pattern. What am I doing wrong here?</p>

But I'm primarily interested in using FPGAs as an accelerator, and I can't figure out what devices will actually offer a speed up over a desktop CPU (say a recent i7).</p>

<p>My particular interest at the moment is cellular automata (and other parallel environments like neural networks and agent based modeling). I'd like to experiment with 3d or higher dimensional cellular automatas. My question is - will the low-cost $100-$200 starter kits provide something that have potential to produce a significant speed up over a desktop CPU? Or would I need to spend more and get a higher end model FPGA?</p>

Here my high-level algorithm to approach this task:</p>

<ol>
<li>Load images and present them NP matrix <code>img_mtx [ img_mtx.shape = (10, 255, 255)</code>]</li>
<li>Use <code>image.PatchExtractor</code> over <code>img_mtx</code> to get the 1000 patches for each image, in total 10000 7x7 pixel <code>patches</code> <code>[patches.shape = (10000, 49)]</code></li>

<li>Now I should have pretty classic task for classification, like spam detection, just adding more images in training set I should have a good result.</li>

I'm largely using the book ""The L Line: Game Programming"" to learn everything, but I use YouTube and Google whenever I need further explanation. However, I can't quite get the hang of classes; it sucks because after a lot of videos and tutorials I sense that they're REALLY important, but if I was asked, I couldn't make my own.</p>

<p>I think understand things like how the <code>.upper()</code> method is a part of python's <code>str</code> class; or that I can call the <code>str</code> module and its upper method for a string like so:</p>

<pre><code>str.upper(""hello world"")

<p>Furthermore, you can define a new class by entering:</p>

<pre><code>class MyClass():

<p>... but then my understanding breaks down. What comes next are attributes, but what would I want an attribute to be? When do I stop making attributes and define a new function in my class? What's the difference between a class function and a class attribute? These are all questions I have and more, but I understand that they're broad and not helpful - as such my main question is this:</p>

"17359833","<p>What is the best way to learn Django 1.5 thouroughly? I have been a .NET developer and have a really good understanding of OOP, HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. I also have an entry-level knowledge of Python. I am completely new to MVC (or MVT, in this case).</p>

<p>I have a need to build apps with Django that provide users with features such as finding each other based on geographical distance, upload pictures and edit them online, natural language search, etc... (just to highlight that I need to know more than how to build a poll app or a simple blog).</p>

<p>My understanding is that the entry point to learn Django is by completing the tutorial at the Django project site. Then, what? What path would you recommend? I have seen that lots of learning resources on the web target versions lower than 1.5 and I couldn't really find books on 1.5. When reading reviews on learning material on 1.4, I often see they are outdated and not really applying to 1.5.</p>

<p>Also, I briefly looked at what it takes to deploy a Django app. Virtualenv, git, pip, etc... are all things unknown to me and it looks a bit scary for a guy used to deploy apps by uploading the compiled binaries through FTP.</p>

<p>Help in defining a clear path to learn how to bend Django to my will would be invaluable!</p>

"17450686","<p>I've been working with PHP for years. Today, I started to learn Ruby on Rails and found an ebook that suits me. The e-book is called <code>Rails for PHP Developers</code>. It is written in 2008, so it covers PHP 5.2 plus Rails 2.0.2.</p>

<p>The only reason I picked this book is, it both explains PHP and Ruby on Rails source. Like, how we create a class or method on PHP, and how it is like on Ruby, what is different etc. Since I already know PHP side, I can easily understand what's going on and adapt myself to ruby syntax.</p>

<p>However, <code>PHP 5.2 is pretty old</code>. PHP evolved so much in last few years, so 5.2 feels like ancient for me. I also used <code>Laravel framework</code> for the past few months, which was created by <code>Taylor Otwell with inspiration of Ruby on Rails</code> framework. I've watched <code>Rails for Zombies</code> screencasts too, and can honestly tell Laravel is a perfect Rails clone. It feels like they're the same thing. ""Yeah yeah, ActiveRecord thing. I know that already.""</p>

<p>With that said; I'm not sure if there are huge differences between RoR 2.0.2 and RoR 4.0.0.
Should I keep reading this e-book or RoR 2.0.0 very old with many missing important features? (That is two major releases difference.) If so, what can you suggest to me?</p>

<p>Also, if there are other great resources for learning RoR, please let me know.</p>

<p>Ps. Help this PHP guy make the correct choice and jump-in to the Ruby world.</p>

In similar way Java has also it's best practices on how to do things. So I'm asking you fellow programmers to list your best practicees and rationalize your answers. Also if you have any advice how to overcome my listed problems, it would be very appreciated!</p>

<p>here is viewcontroller:</p>

<pre><code>#import &lt;UIKit/UIKit.h&gt;

    self = [super initWithNibName:nibNameOrNil bundle:nibBundleOrNil];
    if (self) {

- (void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    ViewController *theview = [[ViewController alloc]init];
    theview.homie = self;

<p>in viewdidload I instantiate the first viewcontroller, and set myself as its delegate.  im assuming then when that viewcontroller2 runs the code in its method then it will see if its delegate has implemented the delegate method and use that code..  what am i missing here?</p>

"17931793","<p>We have a slightly over optimistic boss, so I would like to hear it from other people.</p>

<p>Someone who has about 3 years of good PHP, HTML, and CSS knowledge. However this person has never really worked with any other type of object oriented language like c++, java, python or c#. He is just now discovering things like LESS, media queries/responsive design, minification &amp; bundling, and has no real JavaScript knowledge, and very little of jQuery.</p>

<p>Now how long would you guys estimate it would take (just a ballpark estimate, knowing he is motivated and smart) to be able to make/manage a site in asp.net MVC that has the complexity of a site lets say a mix of Mashable and Twitter and that makes heavy use of cache management, Ajax web services, responsive design, authentication, linq, anonymous functions, delegates, async/tpl, database access, jQuery, and object oriented JavaScript ?</p>

<p>The how long question is more: how long do you estimate till he's is able to make or manage a site like above, but the site must also be of high quality, and able to take on millions of monthly users.</p>

<p>Thanks all !</p>

<p>Please only serious feedback. Even if you guys could break down the learning curves for the different technologies that would be great. I'd like my boss to get a serious and non biased idea of how long these types of things can take to learn.</p>

"18023425","<p>I learned HTML in 1997. I haven't revisited it in all those years, focusing my efforts on server side languages that have been in use at the companies paying my salary (Cold Fusion, classic ASP, ASP.NET). </p>

<p>Now that HTML 5 is here, I've decided to rethink the paradigm and learn the standard way to code HTML and CSS. </p>

<p>Currently the site I manage is built to work in quirks mode. It makes extensive use of nested tables and has no doctype declaration. I've noticed that simply adding an html 5 doctype to the pages causes the page to not render correctly. </p>

<p>Can someone suggest a site or book or other material which will help me eliminate my reliance on tables and make the use of CSS make sense?

"18053885","<p>I need to detect if video file is valid(and delete it if it is not). It is an air application.</p>

<p>For large files it can be accomplished by processing <code>MediaPlayerState.PLAYBACK_ERROR</code> state. No problems.</p>

<hr>

<p>However, when there's an <strong>empty file</strong> like <code>empty.mp4</code>, it does not dispatch any PLAYBACK_ERROR. 
Then I created a file singleChar.mp4 (with <code>x</code> letter inside), the behavior was exactly the same.</p>

<p>It goes through <code>READY</code> state without any problems.  <code>playing</code> is true at that time (it is said in the documentation that it is <code>true</code> when it is <code>playing or attempting to play</code>, so this is also not reliable).</p>

<p>Then I suggested that it treats those files as valid ones with <code>duration=0</code>... No! Duration is not set, <code>durationChange</code> is not dispatched. </p>

<p>The best approach for now is to <code>play()</code> it, <code>setTimeout</code> for about <code>50ms</code> and check <code>duration</code> when this timeout expires. At least it works in 50% cases. However, this is completely <strong>unreliable</strong>. Reliability may be improved by extending the delay, but I'd prefer to detect it quickly and handle silently before user will notice any problems.</p>

<p>Other possible approach is to check if the file is less than some size(maybe,100KB?), however, this is also another stupid unreliable approach.</p>

<p><strong>So, is there a reliable way to detect if a file is a valid video file?</strong></p>

"18061133","<p>Correct me if I am wrong here, but it is possible to implement the XOR function with a minimum of 3 gates (NAND, OR)->(AND) using a 1-layer network. But is it possible to train the network correctly, having each perceptron use only a threshold activation function and a perceptron training rule? i.e. use the perceptron learning rule and not the delta learning rule.</p>

<p>So far my only solution in theory would be to train each perceptron individually for their specific task (i.e. NAND OR and AND) before forming the actual network, but that defeats the point of a network that learns.</p>

"18124023","<p>This question was posted in an attempt to provide tools and strategies for learning, to a programmer at a similar level to the asker of <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/18104693/1"">http://stackoverflow.com/revisions/18104693/1</a></p>

<p>The questioner in that specific case describes themself as ""slightly past the newbie stage of learning Visual C#"" but also as ""an IT Administrator not a professional developer"". They are largely self-taught as a programmer and do not have formal experience of development work or techniques. However, they have ""written a few respectably complex utilities (for my level anyway) using web, ftp, file manip, audio, toyed around with graphics and other Windows Forms methods"". My question is based on my own interpretation of the help they need:</p>

<p><strong>What should a programmer do, who has the ability to write programs and to research, learn about and use libraries, programming tools and languages, do to become capable of coming up with, evaluating, experimenting with, choosing and implementing complete solutions to programming problems?</strong></p>

<p>Many (most) of us on SO are either professional developers or prolific hobbyist developers, as opposed to someone who knows only how to program. So this question is asking us how to learn to do the things we do every day. However, I'm not looking for answers giving career advice, but rather answers giving specific knowledge and tools (both tools for learning and technological tools) which can help someone approach problems in this way.</p>

<p>For convenience, I give the original asker's example problem, which might help us discuss his wider problem more concretely, since we can all refer to the same example. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Specific Problem: Through years of converting, faxing and emailing our company has created quite a mess of a few shared directories. Mostly for learning &amp; practice, I thought I would quickly write a program that reads a directory of files that looks similar to the following:</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>BkUpSalesReportJan2011(txt).zip
BkUpSalesReportJan2011(pdf).zip
BkUpSalesReportJan2011(doc).zip
BkUpSalesReportFeb2011(txt).zip
BkUpSalesReportMar2011(doc).zip
BkUpSalesReportMar2011(pdf).zip
Goes on for a few hundred more files...
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
  <p>After reading the file list, I want to save only one copy of each report based on a list of the file types (in order of priority). I wanted to keep PDFs and delete all the duplicates. If there were no PDFs then keep DOCs and lastly keep the TXTs. This is a simple example but here is where I always feel unsure about what to actually do.</p>
  
  <p>The Questions: Do I add each group of similarly named files to a list of their own and do some string comparisons to get the results and delete immediately? Add all the deletable files to another list and delete when the entire directory has been processed? Is there a way to compare them while initially reading the directory? Is it better to create a small database (which I know very little about) and do some unfamiliar database commands to get the results? Is there a buried option in Windows Forms I need to research that will magically do this for me? Should I just look for some open source module, code or plugin that takes care of all this for me? Should I bug the great folks at stackoverflow.com with this horribly simple dilemma?</p>

<p>I am really lost on what to do first and I hope this is an appropriate question. What should I learn first, what books should I read and in what order. Should I learn how a VGA works before trying Opengl? Are there any other topics I should know before delving into games programming.

I went back to university 3 years ago to achieve a Bachelor's degree in linguistics, and I am now going to enroll in a Masters Degree in Computer Science applied to Linguistics, with the objective of eventually trying to go through a Doctorate (but I'm not there yet :-) ).</p>

<p>The course will focus on speech recognition, automatic language translation, statistical analysis of texts, speech encoding and decoding, and information abstratction from textual sources.
The professors will let us use any computer language we want to use to code the algorithms and programs we will develop during the curriculum.</p>

<p>I used to develop web apps as a side gig for about 3-4 years and I am proficient in Javascript as I wrote software that used node.js at the server end and the browser at the client. I also have some familiarity with postgresql.</p>

<p>My current style of coding (if we can call that a style) is mainly procedural and I use object prototyping as my main way to create/manage objects in my code. I don't have much experience with object oriented language that use the concept of classes to manage the objects. Therefore I am pretty confident my current coding skills are definitely lacking in regards to what is required for me to write efficient code to deal with that stuff.</p>

"18881054","<p>I want to learn angular for it does just what I want from a front-end web app framework. But I am having trouble learning it. It feels as if I was dyslexic with angular, since every time I try to read the most basic tutorials on the angularjs website, I just can't get my head around it. This is sort of embarassing for me. My head and angular just does not seem to speak a common language.</p>

<p>I have never had this trouble with anything else. I have learned jQuery, node.js, PHP, TCL, C#, C++, C, Java, Visual Basic, QBasic (back when I had my DOS computer) and even brainf*ck. I have done desktop apps (GTK+#, Winforms, WPF), games (OpenGL, SDL), websites / apps and what else. Why am I still unable to understand AngularJS? Is it really that hard?</p>

<p>I have read the angular website. I have watched how-to videos from youtube. I have read blogs around the web. And yet I still am having problems with the most basic stuff with angular. I am able to produce something with it by following the tutorials, but I still can not understand why it is designed to be like that. If I tried to put the knowledge I learned from the tutorials in use, I would not be able to produce anything. With the current state it is like working with someone who has the opposite beliefs and point of views and you just can not get along with. If I had the time, I would completly redo the whole framework.</p>

<p>How did you manage to learn AngularJS? Do you have anything to help me understand? Or are there some frameworks equally capable with features, but with completly different design?</p>

"19060556","<p>A friend of mine owns a repair shop. He takes in broken electronics and fixes them. In talking to him, he mentioned that he wished he had some online-based (or at least network-based, so he could access it from any computer in his shop) way to track/log his customers and their information, products, histories, charges, and the current status of items. <br/>For example, someone brings in a toaster oven that doesn't work. He goes to the computer, adds them to the database if they're not already in there (lookup by email, name, phone, or address), then adds their toaster oven (item name, model number, problems, repairs, cost). He can do this with each item and each person, and a list of current products requiring action is generated. Then as he completes repairs, he checks them off as ""repaired (waiting for pickup)"" or ""completed."" When an item is marked ""completed"" it is archived in the person's file, moved off of the ""action required"" list. <br/>Basically, I'd like to create something like this. What concepts do I need to know to make this, and more importantly, what do I need to know in the way of programming languages? I really only have some basic experience with Java, Python, and HTML/CSS, and never any networking. I realize it's a large undertaking, but I'd like to know what it would take for me to build this.</p>

Taking a course or reading NLP books seem to involve getting into far more detail about how NLP tasks are conducted than I need now--I just need to know what it does, how accurate it is, and what alternatives there are.  Jumping into some existing NLP framework seems to get me stuck.  I've used GATE for POS processing, but the output was either in XML, which I have no idea how to further process, or in postgresql, which was a bear to manipulate w/ SQL to generate statistical data.

"19496330","<p>I'm writting a Java (1.7) application to be running on Windows. The application is accessing additional services running on the <strong>same host</strong> and other ones running in the <strong>Internet.</strong> The application can be run in two environments where in one, proxy settings <strong>must be</strong> specified (there is proxy when accessing the Internet); while in the other environment, the proxy settings <strong>must not be</strong> specified (there is no proxy). </p>

<p>I want the application to be simple and don't want its users bother with specification of the proxy settings on cmd-line (-Dhttp.proxyHost, etc.) - the application should <strong>learn the proxy settings from Windows system settings</strong> (IE / Tools / Internet Properties / Connections / LAN Settings).</p>

<p>I have written a piece of code that is supposed to learn that settings, see below. The trouble is that this piece of code does not identify <strong>localhost</strong>, <strong>127.0.0.1</strong> and <strong>my-computer-name</strong> (where my-computer-name is the name of my computer) as URLs where proxy should be by-passed when being accessed (yes, I do have 'Bypass proxy server for local addresses' checked). As a result, the application tries to <strong>access local services through the proxy which is wrong</strong>.</p>

<p>So far I've found out that one way to teach JVM not to use proxy for 'local addresses' is to list the strings (localhost, 127.0.0.1, my-computer-name) in Proxy Settings / Exceptions (Do not use proxy server for addresses beginning with). Obviously, this is not a good solution as usually no one is listing these strings there (the first check-box is enough for non-Java applications).</p>

<p>Second (trivial) solution would be just to count with these strings in my piece of code and do not use proxy settings for them even when JVM thinks otherwise. I don't think this is a good solution and if this is the only solution, IMHO, there is a defect in JVM.</p>

<p>I've found many resources in the Internet how to learn System <strong>proxy</strong> settings. But how to learn the <strong>non-proxy</strong> settings? </p>

PP</p>

<p>Xcode documentation has never heard of <code>WebCoreSharedBufferData</code>, and a search of my project reveals no references to it.

"19648355","<p>I have (multiclass) training data in which the classes were learnt by aggregating hand labeled data, so some rows will have values like [0, 0, 0, 0.4, 0.6]. Is there anyway to use that directly as training data for a classifier. I'd rather not resort to learning 5 regression models, or just setting that data to [0, 0, 0, 0, 1]. Both seem like they'd do worse than learning directly. I know this should be possible for logistic regression at least, but no api seems to support it.

"19671933","<p>After some research I've decided to use wxWidgets to build user interfaces for my Python programs. I learnt this could be done in two ways: either I blend my ""behind the scenes"" raw Python code with interface related wxPython code, or I could separate the interface from the main code, creating a separated XRC file for the interface and just calling it in the main Python code. What should I do, should I learn wxPython or should I learn XRC code?</p>

<p>I read some advantages of learning/using XRC:</p>

<ul>
<li>Separates the interface from the program logic.</li>
<li>Dialog Blocks only outputs to C++ and XRC, not for Python.</li>
<li>Ability to choose between different resource files at run time.</li>
<li>XRC is a wxWidgets standard, so it can be generated and processed by
any program that understands it.</li>
<li>XML is easier to parse than most programming languages.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I think there are some disadvantages too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Documentation seems a lot bigger for wxPython.</li>
<li>More people seems to learn and talk about wxPython, so support for.
XRC may be scarce</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what would be the best to learn, XRC code or wxPython code?</p>

"19749390","<p>About 2 months ago I came up with an idea for an Android App however I had no idea how to program except knowing some QBasic and just general programming concepts. </p>

<p>I find it quite ridiculous myself that someone who has no/little knowledge of programming takes on such a large first time project, but I am sure it's a common problem most people who are not programmers have. Most of which probably do not even make an attempt to learn what they need to learn to make their idea come true, and the ones who do, lose ambition shortly after running into consistent problems while trying to make something.</p>

<p>Since I started, I've learned a great deal of Java, PHP, Javascript, HTML, and the Android Development process. I'm always searching on Google, Youtube for tutorials, tips, and using reference guides almost constantly. Whatever that will make my idea come true the quickest.</p>

<p>Just like I had described I still do run into consistent problems and have been since the beginning and only have little to none of my main project completed and still am trying my best.</p>

<p><strong>So my question to you is what are some tips for someone who is trying to learn as fast as possible to complete their project? Is it just patience? Is it just so ridiculous that it shouldn't be attempted? What kind of mentality should they have? Should they focus on their main project completely or practice on smaller ones?</strong></p>

<p>Sorry if this is an unusual or dumb question but after putting over 100 hours into learning programming I just don't know if I should be doing this... Thanks!</p>

"19755679","<p>I am teaching myself/reading up about assembly. Most of the books on assembly refer to x86- all the register names in the code begin with ""e"" and not ""r"" (as they would in x86-64).

"19760748","<p>Ok, I've been in planning for developing a PhoneGap app for a few months, and it's come time for me to start coding. There are a few things I am confused about that I need to clear up before I can get going, because things don't seem to be going well.</p>

<p>To begin, I am using PhoneGap to build this app because I plan to release it to multiple platforms (primarily iOS and Android) and based on the tutorials for Objective-C that I've read, I'd much rather use JavaScript/jQuery/jQueryMobile to develop the app. If anyone thinks that these are not appropriate reasons to be using PhoneGap and that I should be using something else, please let me know.</p>

<p>I seem to be misunderstanding some things that are apparently self-explanatory about PhoneGap, and after hours of scouring the internet looking for answers, I can't seem to find anyone else who has had the same problems as me. To clarify, I am quite comfortable with my HTML/CSS/JavaScript skills. I literally just need to GET STARTED.</p>

<ul>
<li>I see the terms PhoneGap and Cordova used interchangeably. From the sources I've seen they are pretty much synonymous, but I'd like to know what the ACTUAL difference is.</li>
<li>I'm fairly certain I have PhoneGap installed. I can run PhoneGap commands and I was able to get the basic Hello World application and run it on an iPhone emulator. I then began to make changes to the files and rebuilt and reinstalled to test it and it replaced all my changes with the original application. I'm not sure what I did wrong, but I feel like I'm missing something.</li>
<li>Can I use other JavaScript libraries like jQuery or jQuery Mobile with PhoneGap? I'm not sure what I'm limited to, or if I can use them, what the best way is to do that.</li>
<li>I've seen example applications that were able to use PHP even though many sources say that you can't. How is this done?</li>
<li>Can multiple pages be used or is it better to modify one to make it seem like there are multiple pages?</li>
</ul>

<p>My initial suggestion was to disable autocomplete on the password field of the signup form so that users wouldn't have the option to store credentials until they logged in for the first time.</p>

<p>However, my project manager asked me to research exactly that, whether or not it's possible to have browsers store credentials after submitting an account creation form and then properly fill in the login form upon later visits to the site?</p>

<p>Besides this convoluted explanation, I don't even know where to begin researching, so I'm turning to the community to see if you guys can point me in the right direction, or at least give me the right words to search for.</p>

<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p><strong>Project Summary</strong><br>
   Write a program that produces statistics for a baseball team.   </p>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>  </p>

<p>Create the BaseballStats class:  </p>

<p>It has two instance variables:<br>
       teamName, a String<br>
       battingAverages,  an arrays of doubles representing the batting averages of all the players on the team.  </p>

<p>The class has the following API:  </p>

<p><strong>Constructor:</strong>  </p>

<pre><code>  public BaseballStats( String filename )
</code></pre>

<p>The team name and the batting averages for the team are stored in the file. You can assume the first item in the file is the team name (one word – no spaces), followed by exactly 20 batting averages. Your constructor should read the file into the teamName instance variable and the battingAverages array.</p>

<p><strong>Methods:</strong></p>

<pre><code> public String getTeamName( )
    accessor for teamName

 public void setTeamName( String newTeamName )
    mutator for teamName

 public double maxAverage( )
   returns the highest batting average

 public double minAverage( )
   returns the lowest batting average

 public double spread( )
   returns the difference between the highest and lowest batting averages

 public int goodPlayers( )
   returns the number of players with an average higher than .300

 public String toString( )
     returns a String containing the team name followed by all the batting averages formatted to three decimal places.  
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Client class:</strong>  </p>

<p>Your client should instantiate an object of the BaseballStats class, passing the name of the text file containing the team name and the averages. The client should then call all methods, reporting the results as output.  </p>

"20465548","<p>Currently learning IOS App development using a the big nerd ios programming book and I was on a chapter of the book that focuses heavily on CoreGraphics. I found it hard to grasp so I went through the chapter multiple times and it became slightly easier but I still wasn't 100% confident with it so decided to find a nice core graphics tutorial.</p>

<p>I found myself doing the ray wenderlich core graphics tutorial, it's quite good but I still noticed there where somethings I didn't quite get. Often found myself asking questions like ""<em>why did I just do that?</em>"", ""<em>how am I suppose to know what floating point number to put there?</em>"".</p>

<p>Anyway I woke up at 5am and have been reading various posts and webites for the last 2 and half hours. I stumbled across a <a href=""http://forums.bignerdranch.com/viewtopic.php?f=218&amp;t=4881"" rel=""nofollow"">post</a> that stated:</p>

<ul>
<li>The basics of graphics programming is necessary </li>
<li>C++ is a must</li>
<li>Linear Algebra is a must</li>
<li>Firm knowledge of coordinate system transformation is a must</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How true is the above?</strong> </p>

<p>I mean I remember in the past when learning ruby/rails I ended up needing to pick up various other things in order to be able to build complete websites. On my journey to learn IOS App development I'm starting to see the same thing happen.</p>

<p>I've stopped at chapter 6 of this big nerd book to focus on core graphics and now I'm not even half way through the core graphics tutorial I'm following and may need to stop and do a tutorial on linear algebra amongst other things. </p>

<p>I'd like to do what's really necessary. Stackoverflow is my go to place in these types of situations. I'd like to know from some of the experienced IOS App developers, what do you recommend in this situation?</p>

<p><strong>Is there a set guide you recommend I follow?</strong> </p>

<p>I promised myself I was going to learn IOS Dev properly with no short cuts as understand things thoroughly has made the experience quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>I came across a linear algebra video course on khanacademy. But I'd really only like to put time into what's necessary. I work full time, currently trying to make the transition from networking into the web development industry so I can naturally put time into it rather than having to sacrifice evenings and weekends.</p>

<p>My aim is to be able to build a fully fledged app. E.g. Like twitter, facebook, tagged. I won't be doing any fancy graphics just the kind you'd see on the sites I mentioned.</p>

"20600758","<p>I have a program I am writing and I am wondering how I would use some AI algorithm for my program so that it can learn and assign appropriate weight values to my fields.</p>

<p>For example I have fields a, b, c, d, and e. Each of these fields would have different weights because field a is more valuable than d. I was wondering how I would go about doing this so I can normalize my values and use a sum of these values to compare.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>Weight of a = 1
Weight of b = 2
Weight of c = 3
Weight of d = 4
Weight of e = 5
</code></pre>

<p>For the sum, multiply each field's value with its assigned weight:</p>

<pre><code>Result = (value of a) * 1 + (value of b) * 2 + (value of c) * 3 + (value of d) * 4 + (value of e) * 5
</code></pre>

<p>I am looking to input some training data and train my program to learn and compare the a,b,c,d,e values possessed by each object so that it can assign weights to each one.</p>

<p>EDIT: I am just looking for the method to approach this, whether it be by using neural nets, or some other means to learn and assign weights to these fields.</p>

But, i feel like i don't understand what's happening under the hood well enough to make the leap from beginner to advanced. For example, it's easy to manipulate the database via ORM in django without having any knowledge of SQL. As another example, user authentication in django almost only requires me to import a module and writing a couple of lines of code. I don't have to have any knowledge on sessions, database queries etc ..</p>

<p>As I have done no prior web programming except Django, i was wondering if it would make sense to move to php (without a framework) and when i've learned the fundamental concepts of web development (cookies, sessions, SQL etc) return to Django development?</p>

"20671135","<h2>TL;DR</h2>

<p>I know C and C++ at a professional level. I've recently been informed that for my studies (Physics and Engineering), I must learn Python. (Prof. requires it)</p>

<p>Are there any other languages that are recommend to learn in order to have a general background in computer programming and be prepared to tackle most problems?</p>

<p>Note: Books or online resources are greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>(P.S. The only language I refuse to learn is BASIC)</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I'm a Computer Engineer and Theoretical Physics student, I've been programming in C/C++ for over half a decade, but I was self-taught. This has served me well for computational physics. I even landed a job with a big company at 16, and I currently work for a small media design company working as a server admin and internal manager. (I left the large company due to university taking over my life.)</p>

<p>I recently learned that for my studies, I'm going to have to learn Python in about two weeks... interesting. </p>

<p>I figure if I'm going to branch out to another language, I should become a well rounded polyglot programmer able to tackle most problems with the best language to do so. While this is an infeasible pipe dream, I'd like to still learn to be a good programmer, and I have 4.5 years to do it! (My degrees are 6.5 years with co-op... if I don't do a masters)</p>

<p>If this information helps: I run GNU/Linux as my only operating system and I normally use the Eclipse IDE. 
(Although I may be switching to OSX/XCode soon)</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm worried about this question getting a lot of hate, so I'd like to defend my query:</p>

<p>I am not a professional programmer, but as a computer engineer and as a physicist, programming is important in this day in age, and I'll have to list the languages I know on my resume.
I'd like to look <em>very good</em> when I do so, so I'd like to have an impressive background in programming. 
Since time and energy are finite resources, I'd like to direct my attention towards languages and paradigms which will help me the most in the real world, as well as for my own hobbies.</p>

"20672093","<p>As js is REALLY flexible language I always wondered if it's possible to create custom data type. Finally I've decided to try to create one. I'm not talking about simple class, rather about something what will behave more like js natives. I'm going to create range data type. Math range like (2.5;9] or (-Infinity;5). Also supporting sums of ranges (2;7] u (9;27). It'd allow to easily create iterators eg 2-8 with 0.25 step. I'd like it to support regular js syntax eg. for... in, or length property calculeted basing on step property.</p>

<p>sadly I've noticed that <strong>_<em>iterator</em>_</strong> is supported only in ff but still it should be possible to prepare iterator by making other properties not enumerable.</p>

<p>I know about:</p>

<p>-Object.create/defineProperties<br>
-getters/setters<br>
-use strict (to maximize performance)<br>
-<strong>_<em>iterator</em>_</strong> (actually unsupported)</p>

<p>is there anything else that could be usefull?</p>

<p>Atm. I'd do it this way:</p>

<p>I'd create some hidden vars in local scope to precompute iterators after every change of step and store ranges. To make both completly invisible to user. All properties wouldn't be enumerable except steps - theese would be added with iterator recomputing. So simple range [2;7] with step 2 would look like:</p>

<pre><code>local scope:
ranges:[[2;7]] // more arrays if it'd be sum
iterator:[2,4,6]
//other internal variables

not enumerable:
array: // returns copy of iterator using getter
//some other useful properties

enumerable:
0:2
1:4
2:6
</code></pre>

<p>Is it good idea, or there are other more proper ways to do it? Would it be possible to allow this class to use operators like +-?</p>

"20926657","<p>I have been trying to learn more about Android Game Development this past month. I read the only book I could find about libGDX, and it definitely helped me get started, but there are literally no other tutorials that I have found. </p>

<p>My question is, how do you learn to create games using libGDX if there are no good tutorials out there? I hear a lot of people talk about documentation of libGDX and have no clue what that means. </p>

<p>I guess to generalize it in the most simple way possible, where do I go from here? Suppose the developer just dropped the framework on the Internet today and you were to begin trying to learn how to use it without any help. What route would you take? I'm afraid I've come to a dead end after being so excited finishing the book. </p>

<p>I don't know what kind of combination could work, so I have to copy lib from other tutorial demo, finally this could work:</p>

<li>jquery 1.9.1</li>
<li>handlebars 1.0.0</li>
<li>ember 1.0.0</li>
<li>ember-data 1.0.0 beta.1</li>
<li>localstorage_adapter </li>
</ul>

<p>but most of them are old version!</p>

<p><strong>2. Ember.Object are most deprecated</strong></p>

<li><p><a href=""http://todomvc.com/architecture-examples/emberjs/"" rel=""nofollow"">todomvc</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>they use <code>DS.LSAdapter.extend</code> or <code>App.ApplicationAdapter = DS.FixtureAdapter;</code>, no <code>Ember.Object</code> at all.</p>

<p>And I can't find the <code>DS.LSAdapter</code> and <code>DS.FixtureAdapter</code> in <a href=""http://emberjs.com/api/"" rel=""nofollow"">official api</a> or in the <a href=""http://emberjs.com/guides/"" rel=""nofollow"">official guide</a></p>

<p>This is unnerving to me. In my quest to become a truly capable web developer, the extent of the DOM API has so far been the scariest thing I have encountered. It seems very difficult to me to get a real, strong grasp on it.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering, to developers more experienced with this, how did you learn it? Are there any excellent resources in particular, or an order you went in? Which parts of it are important? Which parts could easily be ignored completely?</p>

<p>I mean, even just in <code>document</code>, there are <em>many</em> methods I am totally unfamiliar with.</p>

"21377699","<p>I made a SVC but I am confused in interpreting the results for the probability. Lets say there are 3 categories cat, dog, and fish and I want to know the probability which it can be of each one so I used <code>.predict</code> to find the prediction and <code>.predict_proba</code> but it does not come out correct for small samples.</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn import svm
X = [[1,2,3], [2,3,4], [1,1,3], [2,3,5], [3,4,6], [2,3,4],[1,2,3]]
y = ['cat', 'dog', 'cat','dog','fish','dog','cat']
clf =svm.SVC(probability=True)
clf.fit(X, y)
a=clf.decision_function([3,4,6])
b=clf.predict_proba([3,4,6])
c=clf.score(X, y)

print clf.classes_
print 'accuracy', c
print 'Fish prediction'
print clf.predict([3,4,6])
print 'decision function', a
print  'predict', b
</code></pre>

<p>If I predict something with low amount of samples like fish it is accurate but can someone explain why the prediction probability is so low: 0.027. (I know it is using <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15111408/how-does-sklearn-svm-svcs-function-predict-proba-work-internally"">Platt Scaling</a> but why was dog not selected at a probability of  0.71) Is there way to obtain the probability which the SVM predicts that the results are fish?</p>

print clf.predict([1,2,3])

<p>I'm wondering how important the <code>coef0</code> parameter is for SVCs under the polynomial and sigmoid kernels. As I understand it, it is the intercept term, just a constant as in linear regression to offset the function from zero. However to my knowledge, the SVM (scikit uses <a href=""http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/"" rel=""nofollow"">libsvm</a>) should find this value. </p>

"21500736","<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>I am given a long list of various position titles for jobs in the IT industry (support or development); I need to automatically categorize them based on the general type of job they represent. For example, IT-support analyst, help desk analyst... etc. Could all belong to the group <em>IT-Support</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Current Approach:</strong></p>

<p>Currently, I am manually building regex patterns to accomplish this, which change as I encounter new titles which should be included in a group. For example, I originally used the pattern:</p>

<p><em>""(HELP|SERVICE) DESK""</em></p>

<p>to match <em>IT-Support</em> type jobs, and this eventually became:</p>

<p><em>""(HELP|SUPPORT|SERVICE) (DESK|ANALYST)""</em></p>

<p>which was even more inclusive.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong></p>

<p>I feel like there should be a fairly intuitive way to automatically build these regex patterns with some sort of algorithm, but I have no idea how this might work... I've read about NLP briefly in the past, but its extremely alien to me... Any suggestions on how I might implement such an algorithm with/without NLP?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p>

<p>I'm considering using a decision tree, but it has some limitations which prevent it from working (in this situation) ""out-of-the-box""; for example, if I have built the following tree: </p>

<p><strong>(Service)->(Desk)->(Support) OR ->(Analyst)</strong> <em>...where Support and Analyst are both children of Desk</em></p>

<p>Say I get the string ""Level-1 Service Desk Analyst""... This should be categorized using the decision tree above, but it will not inherantly match the tree (since there is no root node named ""Level"" or ""Level-1"").</p>

<p>I believe I am heading in the right direction now, but I need additional logic. For example, if I am given the following hypothetical strings:</p>

<ol>
<li>IT Service Desk Analyst</li>
<li>Level-1 Help Desk Analyst</li>
<li>Computer Service Desk Support</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like my algorithm to create something like below:</p>

<p><strong>(Service OR Help)->(Desk)->(Analyst OR Support)</strong> <em>...where Service and Help are both root nodes, and both Analyst and Support are children of Desk</em></p>

<p>Basically, I need the following: <strong>I would like this matching algorithm to be able to reduce the strings it is presented with to a minimal number of sub-strings which effectively match all of the strings in a given cateogory (preferably using a decision tree)</strong>.</p>

<p>If I am not being clear enough, just let me know! </p>

<p>When I use this alternate code, it works:</p>

<pre><code> /*
     TSMPerson *person = [[TSMPerson alloc]init];
     person.first=self.first.text;
     person.middle=self.middle.text;

     self.viewText.text=person.fullName;
     */

<p>but that gives me the extra task of setting the instantiated properties of the person class to the properties in the viewcontroller.  I'm not sure why I can't just pass those property values right into my method and get back the values I want.</p>

<p>I realize this there is probably some basic thing I'm missing, but I can't figure out what it is.  Any help would be appreciated.</p>

"21884364","<p>I'm having trouble trying to learn how to use DOM Document to scrape a webpage. I can get it to work using preg match and regex, but I've been seeing through research that it's error prone and it's better to use DOM Document. Basically I want to convert this:</p>

<pre><code>function lodestone_scraper_preg() {

$html = file_get_contents('http://somepage.com/target'); //get the html returned from the following url

$pattern = '/&lt;div\s*class=""topics_list_inner""&gt;(.*?)&lt;\/div&gt;/s';

$matches = $matches[0];
$five = array_slice($matches , 0, 5);

print_r($five);
}
</code></pre>

<p>into something that uses the DOM Document model. So far I've come up with this:</p>

<pre><code>function lodestone_scraper_dom() {

$html = file_get_contents('http://somepage.com/target'); 
$lodestone_doc = new DOMDocument();

if(!empty($html)){ 
    $lodestone_doc-&gt;loadHTML($html);
    $lodestone_xpath = new DOMXPath($lodestone_doc);
    $lodestone_row = $lodestone_xpath-&gt;query('//div[@class=""topics_list_inner""]');

    if($lodestone_row-&gt;length &gt; 0){
        foreach($lodestone_row as $row){
          echo $row-&gt;nodeValue;
        }
    }
}
}
</code></pre>

<p>But it only spits out the node content without any HTML. I need to have the HTML included as well. The key seems to be saveXML, but I get errors whenever I try to incorporate it. Any hints as to what I can do with this?</p>

"21921987","<p>I'm trying to use scikit-learn's Bernoulli Naive Bayes classifier.  I had the classifier working fine on a small data set using CountVectorizor, but ran into trouble when I tried to use HashingVectorizor for working with a larger data set.  Holding all other parameters (training documents, test documents, classifier &amp; feature extractor settings) constant and just switching from CountVectorizor to HashingVectorizor caused my classifier to always spit out the same label for all documents.</p>

<p>I wrote the following script to investigate what would be different between the two feature extractors: </p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import HashingVectorizer, CountVectorizer

cv = CountVectorizer(binary=True, decode_error='ignore')
h = HashingVectorizer(binary=True, decode_error='ignore')

    doc = fp.read()

cv_result = cv.fit_transform([doc])
h_result = h.transform([doc])

print cv_result
print repr(cv_result)
print h_result
print repr(h_result)
</code></pre>

<p>(where 'moby_dick.txt' is the project gutenberg copy of moby dick)</p>

<p>The (condensed) results:</p>

<pre><code>  (0, 17319)    1
  (0, 17320)    1
  (0, 17321)    1

&lt;1x1048576 sparse matrix of type '&lt;type 'numpy.float64'&gt;'
    with 17168 stored elements in Compressed Sparse Row format&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, the CountVectorizor, in binary mode, returns integer 1 for the value of every feature(we only expect to see 1 since there's only one document); the HashVectorizor on the other hand is returning floats (all the same, but different documents produce a different value).  I suspect my issues stem from passing these floats onto BernoulliNB.  </p>

<p>Ideally, I would like a way to get the same binary format data from HashingVectorizor as I get from CountVectorizor; failing that, I could use the BernoulliNB binarize parameter if I knew a sane threshold to set for this data, but I am not clear on what those floats represent (they're clearly not token counts, as they're all the same and less than 1).</p>

<p>The way i imagined it, was that i'll use html5/js/css for the presentation layer. And through js - AJAX, i will make requests to the server and get responses. Similarly, learn some js framework like Angular, which i will then hook with the server. But reading though the java apis, it seems like JSF (or JSP) is a whole solution for the client side and there won't be need for js at all.</p>

<p>I don't know whether i'm a bad reader and out of my league or the book itself is bad, but they just provide some obscure description of a particular API which you can't comprehend how it fits in the whole picture.

<p>An increasing number of these questions touches on topics of concurrency and distributed computation nowadays. The problem with these types of questions is - good resources are hard to find. Unlike algorthmic questions there are no online judges that tell you immediately whether you are doing things right. Questions posted on sites like careercup come with no answer or an unreliable one. The books that there are that deal with system design are too broad in scope to be useful for interview prep. So: how do you prepare for system design questions short of designing systems for a couple of years? Are there tutorials online? Question - answer (explanation) - type guides?</p>

<p>Well I'm using viewpager. I am creating views with this:</p>

<pre><code>public class CrimePagerActivity extends FragmentActivity {

@Override
    public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

    FragmentManager fm = getSupportFragmentManager();
            mViewPager.setAdapter(new FragmentStatePagerAdapter(fm) {

                @Override
                public int getCount() {
                    return mSorus.size();
                }

                @Override
                public Fragment getItem(int sorusirasi) {

                    return fragment.newInstance(sorusirasi);
                }

"22083643","<p>I want to  explore 3D game development in XNA, but I'm curious if this is best for me. I haven't learned C#, but I want to explore my options before diving in. I have a lot of experience in the C programming language, along with some basics or minor experience in other languages. Which means that the object oriented framework that C# has may be a huge change from what I'm used to. I need to learn it anyways for future jobs and college, so this might would be a good incentive. I have programmed two games using the SDL 2.0 mixer and SDL 2.0 frameworks, which have given me a good basis of the knowledge of how 2D games are structured. I have learned about sprites, frame rate, event polling/handling, frame rendering, among other things. I am still highly lacking in mathematics related to game development and the physics behind it. That leads to my next point of concern if I do decide to learn XNA, is if it would help me more easily learn those things faster? Writing for my games in C, I was always having to write interfaces on top of interfaces, but at least I had to understand what I was writing. With C#, I'm concerned it would abstract most of the mathematics I really want to glean from it. You may ask that if I'm so concerned, why don't I just learn linear algebra and OpenGL/DirectX/whatever in C? Well, I'm hoping to avoid that, since even though I was able to make a decent game, I'm still very much lacking in how to do more advanced game development and code structuring. This was very obvious to me after working on one of my game projects for about half a year.</p>

When someone writes a command, I want that person's avatar to be visible on my (local) application, and depending on what he wrote, I want the avatar to have a different animation.

<p>For example, if the column is <code>political-party</code>, and the values are <code>democrat</code>, <code>republican</code> and <code>green</code>, for many algorithms, you have to break this into three columns where each row can only hold one <code>1</code>, and all the rest must be <code>0</code>. </p>

<p>This avoids enforcing an ordinality that doesn't exist when discretizing <code>[democrat, republican and green]</code> => <code>[0, 1, 2]</code>, since <code>democrat</code> and <code>green</code> aren't actually ""farther"" away then another pair. </p>

"22847375","<p>I'm trying to grapple with PostgreSQL but am finding it a strange beast compared to Microsoft Access.  I'm sure it's just a matter of understanding the new model and would like to learn it hands on.  I have an idea for a database and would like to implement it, but I'm having trouble figuring out the best tools to use.  I can set up postgres on my computer, but I want to be able to develop and play around with the data model.  Because PostgreSQL doesn't come with a visual environment (like Access), I'm a bit lost.</p>

<p>My guess is that I just need to sit down and read the manual front to back, and then tackle learning how to develop a database with PostgreSQL.  With Access, that wasn't necessary, I was able to open it and go, studying along the way.  Maybe my thinking is too entrenched in Microsoft to be able to pick up a new way without a fair bit of study.</p>

<p>I'm wondering if I could see how everything interacts (tables, schemas, views, users, etc...), and be able to edit them in a mostly point and click environment, if the transition would be easier.  This is all on the side, so if it's going to be as difficult as it looks, than I'll have to put this off indefinitely and stick with Access, which I know.</p>

<p>For clarification, I chose PostgreSQL because of cost (free) and strong support in GIS Software through the PostGIS add-on (QGIS, GRASS, even ArcGIS), which is my day job.</p>

<p>Could someone make any suggestions?  Thanks</p>

"22875974","<p>I am trying to install scikit-learn so that it doesn't have access to ATLAS (other BLAS and LAPACK libraries okay). Is there is a way to set the install so that ATLAS isn't used? Sorry for the basic question but I couldn't see a good way of doing it.</p>

<p>The reason I want to do this: I'm working on a cluster where  I can't build atlas, but the pre-installed version of it is broken (compiled on 16 cores, only 8 cores on node, pthread problems), so when I install scikit-learn my scikit-learn tries to fire up these libraries and I get errors.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems I had some things wrong, and actually scipy is still broken after I compile it against openblas. In one of the unit tests I'm getting:</p>

<p>assertion !pthread_create(&amp;thr->thrH, &amp;attr, rout, arg) failed, line 111 of file /var/tmp/portage/sci-libs/atlas-3.10.1-r2/work/ATLAS//src/threads/ATL_thread_start.c</p>

<p>and I just modified the learning pattern to checkerboard instead of XOR and number of nodes in hidden layer to 10. If I understand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_approximation_theorem"" rel=""nofollow"">universal approximation theorem</a> this 3 layer network (one hidden layer) should be able to learn any function from R2 to R including my checkerboard function. ... But it does not. </p>

<p><strong>What is wrong?</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I understand universal approximation theorem wrong - maybe the function should be monotoneous or convex? (The area should be linearly separable? ). </li>
<li>I need an other layer (2 hidden layers) to approximate such non-convec, non linearly separable function?</li>
<li>The network is just traped in some local minimum? (but I don't think so? I tried several runs, initial weight are random, but the result is the same)</li>
<li>10 nodes in hiden layer is not enought? I tried different number - with 5 it is almost the same. With 30 it does not</li>
</ul>

<p>Is there any general approach how to modify the optimization (learning) scheme to be sure to converge to any function which can be theoretically described by the given network according to universal approximation theorem?</p>

I constructed a forest, and prediction works just fine so far. However, I need to know which <strong>particular</strong> features end up in the leaves of single trees after fitting the forest.</p>

<p>I already understood the hierarchical structure, where the random forest builds single Decision trees, which I can access by the ""estimators_"" attribute, and further down the road each Decision tress has a ""tree_"" attribute. In this tree I find information about the specific nodes, leafs and splits, but I am unable to find out <strong>which specific features end up in a leaf</strong>, or even which features are assigned to that specific tree ?</p>

<p>Just to clarify I do not intend to manually analyze tree nodes, but I want to have a similarity measure, based on how frequently a certain set of features is ending up in leafs of the tree together.</p>

<p>Thank you very much !</p>

<p>P.s. just in case anyone is interested, I got the idea for this similarity measure from this paper:

I can make rf.apply(np.array([i,j])), where i,j is the number of the sample in the 2D matrix used to fit the model, and it returns me the leaves in which it is situated. Great ! But the only strange thing is i can use numbers way greater then my actual sample ? Does it assume the last sample if the index is way to big, or am I doing something wrong ?</p>

"23868286","<p>For a project I have to implement an external mergesort algorithm. It will be used to sort a file with mostly numbers or strings and will be some GBs in size. This is the definition of the mergesort that I've been given </p>

<pre><code>void MergeSort (char *infile,
                unsigned char field,
                block_t *buffer,
                unsigned int nmem_blocks,

                unsigned int *nios);
</code></pre>

<p>I'm not allowed to change that. The first argument is the file that I'm going to sort. The second the field according to which I want to sort the file (doesn't interest me right now), the third argument is the buffer. Which is a struct. Here is the definition of a block </p>

<pre><code>typedef struct
{
    unsigned int blockid;
    unsigned int nreserved; // how many reserved entries
    record_t entries[MAX_RECORDS_PER_BLOCK]; // array of records

<li><p>Do I take the file and cut it into two files? </p></li>
<li><p>Is the buffer a file stored in the harddrive or does it stay in the memory? Do I have to create a new file? I'm a little confused with this part.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>These are my thoughts to start right now. First I get the file and split it in two parts. I also create a buffer, which I don't know what size it should have. Then I read the first block of records from the first file, and compare the numbers to the first block of records of the second file. Whenever the number is lesser or equal to another I will send it to the output file. Can you evaluate my stream of thoughts? Or am I thinking it wrong?</p>

"24225196","<p>Are the vectors in scikit-learn <code>Kmeans</code> internally normalized to unit L2 norm or is something wrong with <code>TfidfVectorizer</code>? I perform clustering on text data, which I vectorize using TF-IDF vectorizer. The code is too long to copy here, but in essence I vectorize and cluster data from the 20 newsgroups dataset. I instantiate the vectorizer as (un-normalized):</p>

<pre><code>VectorizerUn = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=10,
                               max_df=0.5,
                               stop_words='english',
                               decode_error='ignore')
</code></pre>

<p>or as (L2-normalized):</p>

<pre><code>VectorizerL2 = TfidfVectorizer(min_df=10,
                               max_df=0.5,
                               stop_words='english',
                               decode_error='ignore',
                               norm=u'l2')
</code></pre>

<p>and I instantiate <em>k</em> means using:</p>

<pre><code>km = KMeans(n_clusters=num_clusters, init='random', n_init=1, verbose=0)
</code></pre>

<p>Then I proceed to split the data for cross-validation, vectorize and fit the train data set (below X in vectorizer stands for 'Un' or 'L2')</p>

<pre><code>Vectorized = VectorizerX.fit_transform(TrainData.data)
km.fit(Vectorized)
</code></pre>

<p>and and assign the data to clusters for messages in the train set</p>

<pre><code>new_msg_vec = VectorizerX.transform([new_msg])
predicted_clust = km_clust.predict(new_msg_vec)[0]
</code></pre>

<p>where <code>new_msg</code> runs through the messages in the train data. Then I assign clusters to groups (each cluster belongs to the group of the majority of its contents) based on the known group labels of the messages in 20 newsgroups, and use the test data to characterize the performance of the clustering/classification scheme. Here is a plot of performance in classification error vs number of clusters for data vectorized without normalization and with L2 normalization:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/gQBPW.png"" alt=""classification error vs cluster size for k-means on text""></p>

<p>The error bars are the standard deviation in the classification error after 10 independent runs of the <code>km.fit(Vectorized)</code> step. The two results are basically identical. Other metrics of the clustering (ARI score, AMI score, NMI score) give essentially the same picture. </p>

<p>So, does Kmeans internally normalize the vectors to L2 norm of 1, or does the <code>TfidfVectorizer</code> <code>norm</code> parameter not do what it's supposed to? (I am using scikit-learn 0.14.1)  </p>

<p>Edit: I found out that the issue is likely not with Kmeans. If I vectorize with L1-normalized constrain (setting <code>norm=u'l1'</code> in <code>TfidfVectorizer</code>),  the clustering error increases  from 45% to about 80%. I changed the title to reflect this.</p>

<p>This is what I want to do:</p>

<p>First-time:</p>

<ul>
<li>Create a Postgres db</li>
<li>Connect to Amazon Server</li>
<li>Download code to server</li>
</ul>

<p>Once a month:</p>

<li>Run code (written in python) to load database with data</li>
<li>Run code (written in Java) to create a Lucene Search Index file from data in the database</li>
</ul>

<p>Continuously:</p>

<ul>
<li>Run Java code in servlet container, this will use lucense search index file but DOES NOT require access to the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Technically I could create do the database population locally the trouble is the resultant lucene index file is about 5GB and I dont have a good enough Internet connection 
to upload a file of that size to Amazon.</p>

<p>All that I have managed to do so far is create a Postgres database but I don't understand how to connect to it or get a ssh/telnet connection to my server (I requested a Direct Connect but this seems to be a different service).</p>

<p><strong>Update so far</strong></p>

<p>FYI:</p>

<ul>
<li>So I created a Postgres database using RDS</li>
<li>I created a Ubuntu linux installation using EC2</li>
<li>I connected to the linux installation using ssh</li>
<li>I installed required software (using apt-get)  </li>
<li>I downloaded data file to my linux installation</li>
</ul>

<p>I think according to the installation should be able to connect to my Postgres db from my EC2 instance and even from my local machine <strong>however in both cases it just times out</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>* Update 2 **</strong></p>

<p>Probably security related but I cannot for the life of me understand what I'm meant to do with security groups ands why they don't make the EC2 instance able to talk to my database by default.</p>

<p>Ive checked both RDS and EC2 have the3 same vpc id, and both are in the same availability zone. Postgres is using port 5432 (not 3306) but havent been able to access it yet. So taking my working EC2 instance as the starting point should I create a new security group before creating a database, and if so what values do I need to put into it so I can access the db with psql from within my ec2 ssh session - thats all that is holding me up for now and all I need to do </p>

<p><strong>* Update 3 *</strong></p>

<p>At last I have access to my database, my database had three security groups ( I think the other two were created when I created a new EC2 instance) I removed two of them and in the remaining on the inbound tab I set rule to</p>

<ul>
<li>All Traffic</li>
<li>Ports 0-65535</li>
<li>Protocol All</li>
<li>IPAddress 0.0.0.0/0</li>
</ul>

<p>(The outbound tab already had the same rule) and it worked !</p>

<p>I realize this is not the most secure setup but at least its progress.</p>

<p>I assume to only allow access from my EC2 instance I can change the IPAddress of the inbound rule but I don't how to calculate the CIDR for the ipaddress ?</p>

<p>My new problem is having successfully downloaded my datafile to my EC2 instance I am unable to unzip it because I don't not have enough diskspace. I assume I have to use S3 Ive created a bucket but how do I make it visible as diskspace from my EC2 instance so I can</p>

<ul>
<li>Move my datafile to it</li>
<li>Unzip the datafile into it</li>
<li>Run my code against the unzipped datafile to load the database</li>
</ul>

<p>(Note the datafile is an Xml format and has to be processed with custom code to get it into the database it cannot just be loaded directly into the database using some generic tool)  </p>

<p><strong><em>Update 4</em></strong></p>

<p>S3 is the wrong solution for me instead I can use EBS which is basically disc storage accessible not as a service but by clicking Volumes in EC2 Console. Ensure create the volume in the same Availability zone as the instance, there maybe more than one in each location, for example my EC2 instance was created in eu-west-1a but the first time I created a volume it was in eu-west-1b and therefore could not be used.</p>

<p>Then attach volume to instance</p>

<p>But I cannot see the volume from the linux commandline, seems there is something else required.</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 5</em></strong></p>

<p>Okay, have to format the disk and mount it in linux for it to work
I now have my code for uploading the data to database working but it is running incredibly slow, much slower than my cheap local server I have at home. I'm guessing that because the data is being loaded one record at a time that the bottleneck is not the micro database but my micro instance, looks like I need to redo with a more expensive instance</p>

<p><strong><em>Update 6</em></strong></p>

<p>Updated to a large Computative instance still very slow. Im now thinking the issue is the network latency between server and database perhaps need to install a postgres server directly onto my instance to cut that part out.</p>

I set up the keyframes and then call the animation on an object but when I load the page nothing at all happens; here is the code: </p>

<p>HTML: </p>

  &lt;/head&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div class=""circle red""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>CSS: </p>

<pre><code>@keyframes up-right {
  0% {
    scale: 1;
    opacity: .25
  }
  50% {
    scale: 1.5;
    opacity: 1;
  }
  100% {
    scale: 1;
    opacity: .25;
  }
}

.circle {
  border-radius: 50%;
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
  opacity: .25;
}

.red {
  background-color: red;
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  -webkit-animation: up-right 1s infinite;
  -moz-animation: up-right 1s infinite;
  -o-animation: up-right 1s infinite;
  animation: up-right 1s infinite;
}
</code></pre>

<p>So I must be missing something because the red circle div does absolutely nothing when I load the page, any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated. Also, on a side note, it would be helpful if anyone can post an example of the syntax for make an object actually move (change position). </p>

"24782006","<p>Thank you in advance for any help. I am trying to implement a deep learning neural network to predict a number of variables (a sort of multivariate non-linear regression). As a first step I am looking at the Darch package in R and working through the code snippets in </p>

<p>When I run the following code from p 10, which appears to be training on 'exclusive or', then the resultant neural network appears to be unable to learn the function. It either learns the (1,0) pattern or the (0,1) pattern as true, but not both, and sometimes additionally the (1,1) pattern, which should be false. My understanding was that these kind of networks should be able to learning almost any function, including for starters 'exclusive or': was this not resolved by the original backpropagation work, which this network utilizes in the fine tuning. I think I could be missing something, so any advice or help is very much appreciated? (I have even increased the epochs upto 10,000, but to no avail.)</p>

I want to learn the best way how to routine things (REST communication, sign in/up,...) are done, which libraries programmers usually use and so on. Simply, I don't like my way of doing apps, my way of creating packages, objects and so on.
For example experienced Ruby on Rails programmer have to exactly know what I mean :) . You never have to invent routine things again in Rails, there is often some ""standard way"" or gem.</p>

"25205667","<p>I am building a Django website and I am using Selenium to test my pages. My problem is that when I run the tests, the browser is launched, but no page is loaded or even attempted to be loaded. It just opens blank and the tests hang. It seems to me that the liveserver doesn't get started. I am running on Apache2 and WSGI, but my understanding is that the Selenium tests are run by the the Django's built-in web server. Any idea what could be wrong? The relevant files are below:</p>

<p>tests.py:</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>Here is update: I found out that the reason Firefox doesn't load the page is because my version of Firefox is newer than the latest version supported by Selenium. So I switched to Chrome and now the URL in the browser is requested. However, the page isn't found (404 error). This must mean that the liveserver is still not running. My tests don't turn on the liveserver when they get run. Any idea why? The port isn't blocked - I checked.</p>

"25211570","<p>I was working on webots which is an environment used to model, program and simulate mobile robots. Basically i have a small robot with a VGA camera, and it looks for simple blue coloured patterns on white walls of a small lego maze and moves accordingly</p>

<p>The method I used here was
​</p>

<ul>
<li>Obtain images of the patterns from webots and save it in a location
in PC.</li>
<li>​​Detect the blue pattern, form a square enclosing the pattern
with atleast 2 edges of the pattern being part of the boundary of the
square. </li>
<li><p>​Resize it to 7x7 matrix(using nearest neighbour
interpolation algorithm)</p></li>
<li><p>The input to the network is nothing but the red pixel intensities of each of the 7x7 image(when i look at the blue pixel through a red filter it appears black so). The intensities of each pixel is extracted and the 7x7 matrix is then converted it to a 1D vector i.e 1x49 which is my input to the neural network. (I chose this characteristic as my input because it is 'relatively' less difficult to access this information using C and webots.​​)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I used MATLAB for this offline training method and I used a slower learning rate(0.06) to ensure parameter convergence and tested it on large and small datasets(1189 and 346 respectively). On all the numerous times I have tried, the network fails to classify the pattern.(it says the pattern belongs to all the 4 classes !!!! ) . There is nothing wrong with the program as I tested it out on the simpleclass_dataset in matlab and it works almost perfectly</p>

<p>Is it possible that the neural network fails to learn the function because of really poor data? (by poor data i mean that the datapoints corresponding to one sample of one class are very close to another sample belonging to a different class or something of that sort). Or can the neural network fail because of very poor feature descriptors?  </p>

<p>Can anyone suggest a simpler method to extract features from the image(I am now shifting to MATLAB as I am now only concerned with simulations in webots and not the real robot). What sort of features can I choose? The patterns are very simple (L,an inverted L and its reflected versions are the 4 patterns)</p>

<p>I wanted to apply machine learning algorithms such as SVM and Naive Bayes using Scikit learn to evaluate a binary classification task. Since scikit does not let the attributes to be string, I transformed them to integers. The transformed sample file is like this:</p>

5,6,1
7,2,0
8,3,0

<p>I wanted to ask if SVM and Naive Bayes consider the input value of first and last names as independent values or there is some relation between numbers? in other words, is it important that 5 is greater than 2, or the numbers are just going to be considered as unique values regardless of their arithmetic value.</p>

<p>The reason for this question is that if I order the list by language(i.e. English speakers first) and then replace the names with integers, the algorithm gives me very good results(accuracy and f score above 97%).

One that I've recently gotten into is javascript. About two months ago I heard about Angularjs and its capabilities. However, I've never done javascript at the time so I thought I'd give myself a few weeks to get familiar with javascript before I tackle Angularjs. A few weeks turned into 2 months and getting familiar is harder than I thought.

Now I'm stumped. It is very confusing to me. All the directives, MVC, controllers and such are so difficult for me to grasp. Experienced developers don't seem to have trouble picking up the framework, but I am so lost. I'm forcing myself to grind on it every single day until it makes sense but I'm rapidly loosing motivation because I don't understand most of it. Is this due to the fact that I still don't know enough javascript to grasp it? Will I have to learn more javascript to learn it? Frankly, I enjoyed javascript that's why I was able to keep doing it for 2 months. But my future for Angularjs is not looking very good and it has only been a week.</p>

"25563483","<p>I'm very new to rails and have been following Ruby on Rails Tutorial book by Michael Hartl these days. I feel like testing is a really important thing for developing rails applications since the testing part covers about half of the entire book. But the more I read the book the more overwhelmed I felt about those code because sometimes I would have to spend so much time learning/ figuring out the test code before I can actually move on to the real code for the application. So my question is, is it really necessary to learn rails and its testing at the same time or it is okay for me to learn the rails basics first and maybe buy a rails testing book to learn it in particular after I get familiar with everything about rails so that I will not be too overwhelmed and I could spend more time focusing on the features using rails.

I know I am going to forget some of these so my question is toward the more expirianced programmers who work in companies. Do you search in google/open old books for reference for these big easy to forget subjects or over the years you learned how to remember them? I need to know if I am going to continue progressing in java. How do you evade forgetting them because I can't remember some of the stuff and I happen to go back a few chapters in my book to remind myself some aspects.

<p>I have a method in assembly L that is consumed by A, B, C, D, etc. This method is going to look for property Q in the settings object.</p>

<p>I don't want to do some ugly hack testing / trying / poking until I find which assembly setting object is being passed. Further assembly E may be added and I'd like to NOT have to rebuild assembly L to add another ""setting"" object to the hack to look for..</p>

"26658110","<p>I messing around with sparse coding from <code>scikit-learn</code> and I want to try to classify images. I have images of size <code>128 x 128</code>. From this I extract random <code>7x7</code> patches to feed to kmeans which has 100 centroids. This means I have a dictionary of 100 atoms.
So given an image to classify I first extract patches from this image with <code>extract_patches_2d</code>, which if I am not mistaken is also called <a href=""http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Feature_extraction_using_convolution"" rel=""nofollow"">convolutional sampling</a>. This means that I have (128-7+1)^2 patches for an image. I can encode every patch by the use of my dictionary and orthogonal matching persuit, leaving my with <code>(128-7+1)^2*(128-7+1)^2 * 100</code> (sparse) features. </p>

<p>What would be the next step in order to transform this <code>(14884,100)</code> matrix to  a feature vector. From what I am reading this is done with average or max pooling, but I can't quite figure out how this works given this matrix.</p>
","0"
"26660550","<p>Typically, we use Autoencoder to learn 2d features on 2d images (e.g. pen-strokes of digit).</p>

<p>For example, if I have 10000 3d 31x31x31 images (e.g. car images). I unroll each of the images, i.e. 31x31x31 to 29791. So, I have 29791x10000 as my input vectors. If I run unsupervised learning---autoencoder on it with 100 hidden units, can I obtain 100 distinct 3d features?</p>

<p>Will the 3d optimal activation equation(in term of weights) for each feature be the same as 2d ones?</p>

"26672791","<p>The scikit-learn function pairwise_distances provides the distance matrix from an array X.
However for some inputs the results seems not to be precise.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

X = [[-0.903858372568, -0.5521578], [-0.903858372568, -0.55215782]]
print pairwise_distances(X)
</code></pre>

<p>Gives the following output:</p>

<pre><code>[[ 0.  0.]
[ 0.  0.]]
</code></pre>

<p>Although there is a distance of 0.00000002.</p>

<p>2nd Example:</p>

<pre><code>X = [[-0.903858372568, -0.5521578], [-0.903858372568, -0.552157821]]
</code></pre>

<p>gives</p>

<pre><code>[[  0.00000000e+00   2.10734243e-08]
[  2.10734243e-08   0.00000000e+00]]
</code></pre>

<p>Here there is a distance but is only correct up to the first digit.</p>

<p>For my application it is undesirable if the output can be zero although there is a distance.
Is there a good way to increase the precision? </p>

"26705739","<p>I've been working with <strong>Dr. Racket</strong> (just started) for the ""Programming Languages"" MOOC on Coursera through University of Washington. So I'm just starting to learn the <strong>Racket</strong> language. In tandem with that I'd like to start reading <strong>SICP</strong> and watching the <strong>lecture videos on MIT OCW from 1986</strong>. I'm wondering <strong>what dialect of Lisp</strong> I should use so I'll be able to have a fairly seamless experience going from the video lectures on MIT OCW to <strong>Emacs</strong> or <strong>Dr. Racket</strong>. [That's essentially my question]. What would people recommend? Especially people who have watched the 1986 lectures, have read SICP cover to cover and worked at least some exercises, and ideally also are familiar with Dr. Racket, Racket and possibly multiple dialects of Lisp and Scheme but I'm open to all opinions. (Stop reading now unless you're curious about where I'm coming from or what my experience is or if you think it would affect your advice). My background is, I've forgotten more languages than I know, but I'm refreshing them and learning new ones and have taken at least 1 semester length course in: FORTRAN, C, Java, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms (CLRS), Automata, Assembly Language, Pascal, Visual Basic, MS DOS Batch Programming (sadly not Linux yet, and I purchased a laptop with Ubuntu preinstalled but I killed it by restarting it while it was installing updates--don't do that!). Now I'm studying ML, Racket, Ruby, Python, and taking the A.I. for Robotic Cars class on Udacity (almost done with that one). This Programming Languages MOOC is the first time I've used Emacs so my workflow in that would be incredibly painful to watch for anyone who knows Emacs (you'd probably want to shoot yourself, well, or me maybe). I notice that <strong>Dr. Peter Norvig</strong> speaks highly of SICP on his website, on the Amazon review of SICP, and in his legacy MOOC on Udacity (just at the beginning of that one).

<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The actual problem I am trying to solve in it's simplest form is this. </p>
  
  <p>I want to have a std::vector of <code>MyClass</code>, call it AllThingsBunchedTogether. 
  I also want to have a std::vector of <code>BaseList</code>, call it AllThingsSpreadOut. </p>
  
  <p>So </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>AllThingsBunchedTogether might contain (just the <code>anInt1</code> part for the sake of compactness): <code>1,2,1,10,2,3,4,4,5,9,10,10</code>. </li>
  <li>AllThingsSpreadOut might contain (zero not used for now) at [1] <code>1,1</code> at [2] <code>2,2</code> at [3] <code>3</code> at [4] <code>4,4</code> at [5] <code>5</code> at [9] <code>9</code> at [10] <code>10,10,10</code>. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Note that the numbers themselves aren't be stored in the <code>BaseList</code>, but e.g., the <code>MyClass</code>(1, ""John""). </p>
  
  <p>At [1] it could be ""Mike"", ""John"", at [2] it could be ""Mike"", ""Dagobart"" at [3]
  ""John"" ... at [10] ""John"" ""Mike"" ""Dagobart"" etc so that there no duplicates in
  any of the <code>BaseList</code> at AllThingsSpreadOut[i] since each <code>MyClass</code> in each
  <code>BaseList</code> hashes to a different value (<code>anInt1 + Name</code>). </p>
  
  <p>In essence, <code>anInt1</code> tells where the <code>MyClass</code> lives in AllThingsSpreadOut, but <code>anInt1 + name</code> guarantees uniqueness within each <code>BaseList</code>.</p>
  
  <p>So the idea is that AllThingsSpreadOut is a vector of <code>BaseList</code> where at each <code>BaseList</code> at vector location is a list of similar things. </p>
  
  <p>Then, when I remove things from AllThingsBunchedTogether (not by a clear, but by a search to remove some items like in the code below IsMarkedToDelete), they will automatically disappear from the corresponding AllThingsSpreadOut. </p>
  
  <p>AllThingsSpreadOut acts as a sort for AllThingsBunchedTogether, with intrusive semantics. AllThingsBunchedTogether allows superfast access through [].</p>

<p>Here is my situation:
I have a directory of hundreds of text files.  I loop through every file in the directory using a basic for loop and do some processing (text processing on the file itself, calling an outside program on the file, and compressing it).  When complete I move on to the next file.  I continue this way doing each file, one after the other, in a serial fashion.  The files are completely independent from each other and the process returns no values (other than success/failure codes) so this seems like a good candidate for multithreading. </p>

<p>My questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>How do I rewrite my basic loop to take advantage of threads?  There appear to be several moduals for threading out there.</li>
<li>How do I control how many threads are currently running?  If I have N cores available, how do I limit the number of threads to N or N - n?  </li>
<li>Do I need to manage the thread count manually or will Perl do that for me?</li>

I pickle the trained object and want to run individual observations against it.  When I run an individual observation through the massage process (including get dummies) I only get a column for that one day and one month.  If I try to feed this to my pickled algorithm, I get an error because the object is expecting columns for each day and month.

<p>I apologize that I cannot comment on other questions yet or I would have just done so on that question.  I too was looking for the functionality the mapper app provided (specifically the capturing and saving of 3d environments) and have found through searching and reading that question that it is not available for the tablet.  The answer provided to caspertm's question was to use the point cloud data sample code as a starting point and modify it to log the data to a file.</p>

<p>I am wondering if anyone would be willing to go into more detail about what needs to be modified to the point cloud sample (I am using the Java version) to save that data and retrieve it later on my computer so I can manipulate it in a program like blender or unity.</p>

<p>I am very new to the android developing process.  I can read the sample point cloud java code and get a very basic understanding of what is going on, but I definitely have a lot of learning to do.  I realize I am asking for a lot of help and don't expect any one person (or even several) to paint me the entire picture, but tips on things like: whether this data should be saved internally or externally, which java file requires the saving code, how to format the file to be readable in other 3d programs and how to see more than just the current snapshot of the point cloud would be greatly appreciated.  If anyone could point me in the right direction of how to get the actual environment colors projected onto the cloud data, that would be amazing too, but any help or links for any of these requests would be greatly appreciated.</p>

"27761261","<p>I think this should be a good place to ask these questions.</p>

<p>It seems there is a big need for programmers so much so that programming bootcamps are popping up every where. I don't have a degree because I chose to focus on learning foreign languages and cultures instead.When I was in school I was considering majoring in computer science and I even took some introduction to programming classes. I am considering getting back into it. With all the programming boot camps available I am considering doing one but I want to make sure they are worth it.</p>

<p>What is your impression of people that go through programs like that and would you actually hire them?
What qualities would such a camp need to provide to make it worth it?
What are your needs in a potential employee?
Give me any details that you believe are relevant.</p>

<p>I know html/css and have built a website in html/css and then converted it into a Wordpress theme.I am familiar with PHP from that experience. If I do the boot camp that I think would be good, class is 40 hours a week and 20-30 hours a week of out of class study. The first 12 weeks would be learning to code and the second 12 weeks would be working on real life projects.</p>

"27812103","<p>For those that haven't seen it, ZPL is a text-based markup language used for printing labels from special-purpose printers. A UPS shipping label would be a good example.</p>

<p>The markup language is quite primitive.  There are modal commands to set a few state values, but the bulk of the language is one-liners that take the form <code>&lt;command&gt;&lt;parameters&gt;&lt;data&gt;</code>.  There is no flow-control or nesting.</p>

<p>I want to write a rendering engine that interprets ZPL and renders to an image.  There are a couple projects that have started down this road, but those projects are not complete enough for commercial use. </p>

<p>My question is: What do I need to learn to write a great <code>&lt;something&gt;</code> that will parse a ZPL document and convert that into commands I can execute?  (By 'execute', I mean draw.) </p>

<p>Is this a parser? a lexer? tokenizer? interpreter?  Is there some subset of compiler design theory that would be the most efficient path to success for this kind of project? ... and what is that called?</p>

"27815920","<p>I looked at the user guide <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/6.1.0.Final/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#d0e2669"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jboss.org/optaplanner/release/6.1.0.Final/optaplanner-docs/html_single/index.html#d0e2669</a></p>

<p>I looked at the example code from git, but still feel quite lost about how to model my planning problem (for example some special TSP variant, let's say  TSPTW ). the way OptaPlanner user code is structured is that the user code is devided into several packages, and there is not a entire ""end-to-end"" flow of code, and as a developer I only see these ""modules"" , sort of. So as a result it's very difficult for me to figure out how to connect the dots, and how these ""dots"" interact together to accomplish the overall algorithm task.</p>

<p>the section in the link above ""Model your planning problem "" sort of touches on the above question I have, but still seems out of sync with the example code, so it's difficult to figure out how the current examples work, also it's difficult for me to see how to add my own special logic for the TSP variant .</p>

<p>is there a better ""code walk-through"" document to show the usage of the framework?</p>

<p>thanks

I get a problem that I use a listView to show hundreds of images from my local resources,and I set the image full of screen.There is a item with a imageView and a TextView in each list item.But when I slide to the next item ,it's not smoothly .I use the ImageFactory.options to adjust the scale of images.But the problem still exists.I guess maybe I should use asynctask loading and image cache to fix this problem.
here is my code,hope you buddies point my problems.Thank you very much.</p>

"28200438","<p>I have a class project that I did from college that ""works"", but isn't constructed properly.</p>

<p>It has a Date class and a Person class.</p>

<p>In my ""working"" code, all of the class data (constructors, members, and functions) are contained within a single header file for each class (a separate file for each class).</p>

<p>The program loads text file data (Persons, presidents and actors) into a vector, sorts, filters and prints the data on the console, and saves it to a file.</p>

<p>In the Person class constructor (and functions), the Date class is instantiated for a ""birthdate"" object. Then the birthday is used in the program.</p>

<p>The problem I'm having is this:</p>

<p>I can easily instantiate ""Date"" in the Person constructor and members, if all the class code is in a header file for each class, AND I make the Date the ""Parent"" class for Person. But if I don't do both of these things, then ""Person"" doesn't know anything about ""Date"" and cannot instantiate anything from Date.</p>

<p>If I use an #include ""Date.h"" in Person.h, this creates even more problems and doesn't work either.</p>

<p>Of course, ""Date"" is not a proper parent class for ""Person"", but it was the only way I could hack the code to make it work lol. When I first coded this years ago in college, I never did figure out how to divide the class code properly in so that it would compile and run. The ""working code"" with all the class code in a header file is my hack. I want to learn how to do it the right way.</p>

<p>I have pasted in the bare minimum example below of what ""works"" and what doesn't. Any tips to make this code work with the classes divided into header and .cpp files would be much appreciated.</p>

Also, is there any better/easier way to build an app in Netbeans beside Codename One?</p>
