</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, this implies that if you come up with a new <code>AccessType</code>, you have to make corresponding changes to the backend table.  In general, the &quot;standard&quot; approach to storing data in SQL will always have this type of table structure (where adding distinctly new functionality requires corresponding changes to the table structure).</p>

<p>I&#39;m definitely not saying your approach won&#39;t work, I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s unusual and typically not recommended.  See this stackoverflow post for other comments from other people: <a href="http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/227922/is-saving-sql-statements-in-a-table-for-executing-later-a-bad-idea">http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/227922/is-saving-sql-statements-in-a-table-for-executing-later-a-bad-idea</a></p>

<p>To list some of the reasons why I dislike storing SQL queries inside a table:</p>

<ul>
<li>A SQL query inevitably contains SQL syntax.  Ideally, SQL tables would store data in a format that&#39;s independent of implementation details, but if you store SQL queries in your table, you lose that.  This makes certain operations harder.  For instance, if you migrate from one SQL implementation to another (e.g. mySQL to SQL Server), you may find that the syntax differs slightly, and you&#39;d then have to go back and rework all those queries you stored.</li>
<li>At some point, I imagine you&#39;ll want to change your <code>AccessType</code>.  This isn&#39;t too hard with either approach, but suppose you wanted to present to the user their current access.  So for instance, if the shop is restricted to only clan members, you want to display &quot;This shop is restricted to only members of clan X&quot;.  Or maybe the shop is restricted to only people above a certain level, and you want to display &quot;This shop is level-restricted.  You must be level 30 or higher to access this shop&quot; when a low-level user tries to walk in.  You can&#39;t do any of this easily if you don&#39;t store the data in a normalized format.  The only thing your query can do is fetch the set of users that can enter the shop; your table storage doesn&#39;t specify <em>why</em> the users can or cannot enter.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="md"><p>That literally describes every single possible SQL query one could write, and sounds so stupid that I can&#39;t believe that you even believe that&#39;s a good reason.  But you&#39;re probably already attached to this genius idea you have and are going to do it regardless.  The good news is you&#39;re almost certainly not working at a scale where this will matter, and if you are it won&#39;t affect me when something this stupid causes problems.  :D</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I would recommend printing variables inside and outside each loop to see the order things are happening. Here is an example of something you might see, which gives you an idea of what is happening.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I think you are really confused on what you are actually doing and that is the reason you can not explain what you need help with. 
If you want help with something you do not understand you can not properly estimate what information is relevant. Post the exact task because your interpretation of it is most likely incorrect.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>&#39;Cause they&#39;re to do with individual rows in the database.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So for every new <code>AccessType</code> I dream up, I possibly need some more columns in <code>Shops</code>?</p>

<p>I don&#39;t imagine anyone sensible would <em>want</em> to do this, but if someone did, I would like them to be able to have some shop open to people who used the phrase &quot;I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s not butter!&quot; exactly 3 times in the past 2 weeks.  At that point, isn&#39;t it easier and tidier to just have SQL queries hanging about?</p>

<p>(Ignoring the problems with <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">cache invalidation</a>).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Similar, but on a much grander scale. Homebrew taps into a vast repository of Linux &amp; BSD packages, most patched to run well on OSX. These can be installed (kind of) at the operating system level and used universally.</p>

<p>For instance <code>brew install erlang node ffmpeg dopewars</code> would install a new language, a powerful JS runtime, a media manipulation suite and a game in one command.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry I figured that this subreddit would be fitting considering that part of learning to program isn&#39;t always limited to the code itself.</p>

<p>Also this project wasn&#39;t one started by the business nor have I been paid for it.  It is just a pet project I started making just to learn PHP and MySQL, so I don&#39;t know if that changes anything.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Wtf?...</p>

<p>I meant what&#39;s the benefit of storing these queries in the database, not what&#39;s the benefit of having SQL queries that do whatever in your game...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmm, like...  In Python I can do this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; a=set([1, 2, 5])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b=set([2, 4, 5, 7])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.difference(b)
set([1])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.intersection(b)
set([2, 5])
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>I thought I could do similar with OUTER JOIN or similarly confusingly named things.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>And yet it seems that you don&#39;t realize that I was fully aware of your advice, and you don&#39;t seem to understand that your advice was absolutely worthless.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I guess that&#39;s possible, except you have yet to identify the thing I said that&#39;s actually the advice, let alone explain why it sucks.  So that just looks like some idiotic fantasy you have.  Keep running with that if it makes you feel better.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sure, so to be clear, database design is also kind of an art, so there are usually more than one way to do things.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just listing out one of the more common ways to do this.</p>

<p>Your specs were &quot;I want one shop to be available to members of a certain clan, another shop to be available to people whose accounts are a certain age, another shop to be available to people whose names begin with the letter &quot;P&quot;, etc.&quot;.</p>

<p>Your <code>shops</code> table would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>Shops:
   #id (integer ; identity column)
    name (string)
    accessTypeId (non-nullable integer ; foreign key to the accessTypes table)
    clanId (nullable integer ; foreign key to the clans table)
    age (nullable integer)
    initialLetter (nullable char)

AccessTypes
    accessTypeId     description
    1                      &#39;By clan.  Only members of a certain clan may visit this shop.&#39;
    2                      &#39;By age.  Only users whose age are above a certain value may visit this shop.&#39;
    3                      &#39;By initial letter.  Only users whose name begins with a certain letter may visit this shop.&#39;
    4                      &#39;Public.  All users may visit this shop.&#39;
    5                      &#39;Closed.  Nobody can visit this shop.&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>Then, for instance, if you want to make shop #123 restricted to only clan 50, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE shops
SET accessTypeId = 1, clanId = 50
WHERE id = 123
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you wanted to make a shop restricted to only people whose names begin with the letter &quot;P&quot;, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>UPDATE shops
SET accessTypeId = 3, initialLetter = &#39;P&#39;
WHERE id = 123
</code></pre>

<p>In your game logic, to determine who has access, you then read from the <code>shops</code> table.  Given the <code>accessTypeId</code>, <code>clanId</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>initialLetter</code>, your game logic code can then generate the appropriate SQL query.</p>

<p>If your shop access logic got more complicated, you could also move all of this stuff (e.g. clanId, age, initialLetter, etc) to a completely separate table (e.g. <code>accessInfo</code>) and just have a <code>shop</code> store an <code>accessInfoId</code>. </p>

<p>Another nice thing is that, when tables store information in this type of standardized way, you can easily see certain properties.  For instance, you could easily write a query to see how many shops are restricted by clan, since that information is right on the table.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>thank you for the advice fellow :D</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That was a rhetorical question.  It appears as though the answer for one wheel is the list containing each element on the wheel.  If you know that, you should be able to make the recursive call to get those solutions and then use those solutions by combining them with the solutions for the current wheel.</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;List&lt;Symbol&gt;&gt; restOfSolutions = calculateAllOutcomes(numWheels - 1, numSymbols, outcomesLeft);
List&lt;List&lt;Symbol&gt;&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;List&lt;Symbol&gt;&gt;();
// combine restOfSolutions with current wheel&#39;s symbols here
return result;

<p>If things turn out ugly, can I revoke use of this software once I have allowed them to use it?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Best to have an agreement in place. Do that now, while things are not ugly. Talk to a lawyer.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can (and at work, we occasionally have tables that contain SQL queries), but in general, you should avoid it when possible.</p>

<p>There are usually cleaner ways to implement whatever logic you&#39;re trying to do.</p>

<p>Just to give one example of the consequences, imagine one day you wanted to rename a column; for instance, you decide to rename <code>clanid</code> to <code>guildid</code> on the <code>users</code> table.</p>

<p>If you follow normal database design, this is do-able with some amount of work.  You simply find all the places where <code>users</code> is used, and you change occurrences of <code>clanid</code> to <code>guildid</code>.  If you store SQL queries in a string within the database, then you have to go parse through all the tables that contain SQL queries and fix those too. It might turn out that someone named themselves &quot;guildid&quot;, so now to do it completely right, you have to actually re-parse the SQL query.</p>

<p><strong>The textbook approach would be to store the information necessary to generate the query, rather than store the query itself.</strong></p>

<p>Maybe your shops in your game are sometimes restricted based on guild (i.e. &quot;only members of guild X may enter this shop&quot;), or maybe based on person (i.e. &quot;only this user and his friends may enter this shop&quot;) or maybe completely public.</p>

<p>The textbook approach would then say that the shop should have some sort of <code>permissionType</code> (which could be <code>guild</code>, <code>public</code>, or <code>person</code>), and maybe some additional metadata about each one (e.g. if type is <code>guild</code>, what is the <code>guildId</code> of the guild).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Read the FAQ for challenges.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can place your parse method and the sum line inside the <code>else</code> block of your <code>if</code> statement.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, it&#39;s fine to do this.  Most commonly I see this done with internal analytics dashboards where people can write queries and there is some kind of system to generate a report from the raw query.</p>

<p>In this case, though, SQL is likely the wrong level of abstraction.  For starters, SQL queries aren&#39;t composable.  It&#39;s not easy to say things like this in SQL...</p>

<pre><code>canPurchase = memberOf(ownClan) &amp;&amp; !memberOf(specialClan)
</code></pre>

<p>to mean &quot;can purchase from a member of their own clan unless they&#39;re a member of specialClan.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s easy enough to say that <em>one</em> specific thing in SQL, but it&#39;s not easy to break it apart into composable units.  I can imagine that this will quickly become a thing you need to do unless you want the logic for each player to depend in subtle way&#39;s on the logic for every other player.</p>

Our IT department is also rather large and employs at least 3 &quot;apprentices&quot; under the age of 25 that we mostly can relate to in some way.</p>

<p>Sure. A neater way might be to construct the queries from some metadata, however.

A stored procedure (sometimes called a <strong>proc</strong>, <strong>storp</strong>, <strong>sproc</strong>, <strong>StoPro</strong>, <strong>StoredProc</strong>, <strong>StoreProc</strong>, <strong>sp</strong> or <strong>SP</strong>) is actually stored in the database <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dictionary">data dictionary</a>.</p>

<p>Typical use for stored procedures include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_validation">data validation</a> (integrated into the database) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control">access control</a> mechanisms. Furthermore, stored procedures can consolidate and centralize logic that was originally implemented in applications.

One can use nested stored procedures by executing one stored procedure from within another.</p>

<p>Stored procedures are similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_defined_function">user-defined functions</a> (UDFs).

</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah like <a href="/u/CheerfulDonut">/u/CheerfulDonut</a> said, it&#39;s not really the kind of thing you memorize. I&#39;ve been using it for a while and I still occasionally have to look up some things. And even if you quiz me on it, I might not do well because it&#39;s mostly muscle memory. Just maybe have it as a tab while you work on something and whenever you need something, just switch to the tab and look it up. Memorizing something like this is really just wasting your time and brain space. Don&#39;t worry about memorizing things that you can easily Google.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re right, this is probably what I needed to hear.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You have to get the data there somehow. So it would be in the constructor of the other class, or some kind of variable at namespace scope.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t memorize. Look it up when you need it.</p>

<p>I have to be blunt. It should take all of 5 minutes to read the entire syntax page. </p>

<p>Do you really need to use a roundabout method in order to learn it? I mean there are less than 20 pieces of syntax. You could fit the information on a sticky note.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes? Most secondary schools in the UK give all students email accounts.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s probably because you are doing <code>Es.length</code> in your second loop which is undefined. <code>Es</code> is an integer, so you can just say <code>j &lt; Es</code> without the &quot;length&quot; part.</p>

<p>However, this won&#39;t make your code correctly return the n (or actually <code>Es</code> in your code) smallest values. Think about what will happen if your input is [&quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;E&quot;].</p>

<p>I also think you may be misunderstanding the <a href="http://coderbyte.com/CodingArea/GuestEditor.php?ct=Off%20Line%20Minimum&amp;lan=JavaScript">assignment</a>. It is not to return the smallest n values, but rather: whenever you encounter an E, move the smallest value in <code>list</code> to <code>smallList</code>. This is why the answer in their example is 4,1,5 and not 1,2,3.</p>

<p>Finally, I recommend that you use curly braces for the first for loop as well. Your indentation suggests that maybe you think the second loop is nested inside the first one, but this is currently not the case.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is a good approach, although the use of a lot of tiny malloc calls bothers me on some level. A similar approach would be to define a structure that represents each code in the file, the advantage here being that you could potentially add members to that structure to hold results of working on the codes (for example if you had to calculate/store resistance figures, costs or something like that).</p>

<p>For just storing the code, the structure would look something like:</p>

<pre><code>struct resistor_code_s {
    char codetext[6];
};
</code></pre>

<p>and then you would allocate a block of memory in one operation which reserved <code>sizeof(struct resistor_code_s) * n</code> bytes, where n is the number from the top of the file and create an array of those structures in it.</p>

<p>By then reading each code from the file into successive elements of the array, (ie: into &#39;array[i].codetext&#39;) you would end up with much the same result, but with a single malloc. I&#39;d use calloc() instead of malloc() as calloc() zeros out the reserved memory for you which might avoid issues relating to garbage data depending on how much more processing your program needs to do. Either that or use malloc() followed by bzero() to initialise the reserved memory explicitly.</p>

<p>The difference would be that you would reference any given code  in memory using <code>array[n].codetext</code>, and the resulting program would allow you to easily extend the structure to contain additional information about each code.</p>

<p>If nothing else, this is just to illustrate another way of thinking about it. There&#39;s nothing wrong with exoticmatter&#39;s solution, which may be easier for you in any case.</p>

<p>In case you&#39;re wondering why we&#39;re suggesting 6 characters per string, even though you see a maximum of 5 in the file - the 6th is for the terminating &#39;\0&#39; character in cases where there is a 5 character code. You probably knew that, but just making sure.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>On line 10 you wrote <code>j &lt; Es.length</code>. <code>Es</code> is a number and thus that property is not valid.  </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That part is clear. But for the requirements you stated I could say: Go buy the WD unit you linked and be done with it. </p>

<p>Clearly there is a reason you don&#39;t want to do that. Maybe this is mostly a learning exercise for you? Or you just want to get something working. In each case we might recommend different things. </p>

<p>Here is another consideration: Where do the SD cards come from? If they get written by something that you have full control over, then you might get away with only implementing as much (or rather, as little) file system than you can get away with. (For example you could stipulate that files can not be fragmented, which make the FS simpler if you are writing it from scratch)</p>

<p>But if you want to be able to read from different cameras, or other sources, you might have to implement several file systems, and you&#39;ll have to implement all of their features. Like, for example, do you need exfat support? Impossible to say without knowing the actual problem you are trying to solve.</p>

<p>Then there is the question how you get data off the ssd. That&#39;s even more drivers. </p>

<p>If you want this to be very full featured, running Linux on an Arm might be the right thing. Heck, for some requirements, maybe putting a RaspPi in there might be the right solution. For other requirements, using a little 8 bit micro might be the right thing. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, a parent class can indeed access a child classes members and functions via the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I do, and I&#39;m not alone. See tail call optimisation for how people can write recursive functions that don&#39;t grow the control stack.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>My thoughts exactly, I didn&#39;t have a chance to try it however. I haven&#39;t been at my computer.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There is a way, it&#39;s called the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern. While primarily a C++ thing, the same trick can be done in Java. It lets you inject the child class as a template (a generic in Java) type, and the base class has an instance of the child class in it. This lets the parent call child member functions.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know, but they&#39;re supposed to be object elements in a general object array (containing superclass and subclass objects) if that changes anything.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Does anyone actually use recursion in real life? Isn&#39;t it frowned upon and ends up with stack overflows anyway?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Google, google, google. Search &quot;&lt;what I&#39;m trying to do&gt; &lt;language&gt;&quot;. Maybe throw in a library or framework if you suspect that they have a solution. For example, if I wanted to sort a C++ vector of custom objects, I could search for &quot;C++ sort vector&quot;. I could search &quot;C++ sort vector of custom objects&quot;, but that shouldn&#39;t be necessary (but won&#39;t really hurt).</p>

<p>First result is a site about <code>std::sort</code>, which does exactly what we need and has examples of how to use it.</p>

<p>You won&#39;t always find standard library solutions. Other times you&#39;ll find a StackOverflow thread where people will have posted snippets of code you could use, or maybe they&#39;ll link to a library that can be used. IMO, don&#39;t shy away from libraries. Even if you only need them for one thing right now, you&#39;ll be able to utilize them for more purposes later. If you decide against using a library because you don&#39;t want to use a large library for one little thing, you might later find more and more cases where you could have used that library. Where do you draw the line at when you should have used it? And if you don&#39;t start out with it, you&#39;ll have lost time reinventing the wheel.</p>

<p>Anyway, once you&#39;re using a library and suspect that the library has something you&#39;ll need, try throwing the library into your search to see if it has anything you need. For example, suppose that I was creating a JS app and was using jQuery. Now suppose that I know how I can disable an input with vanilla JS, but since I&#39;m using JS, I can instead try searching for &quot;javascript jquery disable input&quot;, which will find the more compact <code>$(&quot;input&quot;).prop(&#39;disabled&#39;, true);</code> syntax.</p>

<p>Point being, even if you know how to do something, Google it anyway. You might find a better way to do it. Or you might find discussions that will alert you to possible issues or other things to consider about your approach.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR: Google is your friend</strong></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you for the feedback! That makes sense. If I go that route, a sentinel value shouldn&#39;t be necessary anyway. I will try that and update once I do.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I got it to work, but still can&#39;t figure out the sentinel value correctly. I had to change my exception from what is above to a NumberFormatException, since I&#39;m working with strings. </p>

<p>If I use a string as a sentinel value, it triggers the exception. If I use the -1, it takes it off of the sum (which I don&#39;t want to do).</p>

<p>The question doesn&#39;t appear to ask for a sentinel value, however, if a user inputs several numbers in the correct format and wants to stop, there should be a way to do that (at least in my opinion). I guess the other option is to enter two incorrect inputs and then the sum will compute as it should.</p>

In fact, I&#39;ve heard people claim that they&#39;d think less of those who show off certificates (the logic being that they&#39;re disconnected from the software development community).</p>

<p>Stuff from accredited universities (like a bachelor&#39;s degree or higher) has a fair bit of weight, but doesn&#39;t show skill with any particular language or anything. Not to mention that they are very time consuming and expensive.</p>

<p><a href="/u/Kwinten">/u/Kwinten</a> hit the nail on the head here. Projects show real world experience in some technology. That&#39;s better than some kind of certificate and even better than a degree in many cases. Even people with degrees can be shitty programmers. Projects show you really can program and how well you can do so.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That seems odd. Generally, you want to keep accessibility of instance variables and methods as tight as possible. If accessibility of a variable of a subclass is needed in the superclass (and that doesn&#39;t exist in the superclass), the whole hierarchy is not well designed. Perhaps the assignment is meant to show that? </p>

<p>No matter what, you will need a reference of the subclass type to modify the variable. Otherwise, there is no way to know that the variable exists.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>This seems to fix the problem thanks! The one issue is that it appears that occasionally balls get stuck to each other and will not move. I have a feeling that what happens is the balls end up moving too close and the checkCollision method returns true and so they invert their x and y directions. However, the don&#39;t move far enough apart and checkCollision returns true again and they invert their directions again and it goes on infinitely. I just need to find a way to work around this.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You could use static variables...</p>

Arrays can work if you have a compact set of integer IDs to refer to each item.</p>

<p>Maps, on the other hand, let you use any kind of key to get a value in a reasonably efficient manner (hashmaps are O(1) in their best case, where the hashes are unique and there&#39;s no collisions within the container). A map could be used if the job IDs heavily vary (eg, if we have jobs with IDs 14, 1515, and 6141). Maps can technically work with any kind of type, too, although integers or strings are the most common keys.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>A super class cannot directly access variables or methods that are declared in a subclass. You can&#39;t do this because there&#39;s no way to guarantee that all subclasses would have the same variables. </p>

<p>You can allow a super class to indirectly access values from a subclass by overriding or implementing methods that are declared in the super class, which the super class utilizes. Though, you should generally try to avoid doing this unless the superclass was specifically designed to be subclassed and used in this way. Otherwise, you&#39;ll be depending on particular implementation details of the superclass (i.e. depending that the superclass will utilize the method that you&#39;ve overridden).

<p>1) You missed some <code>;</code> in your JS code. On line 6 &amp; 13.<br/>
2) <code>&lt;form onsubmit=&quot;&quot; .. &gt;</code> is buggy, I have no idea why but it doesn&#39;t work like that. Instead of doing that, set an unique ID to your form and set the event callback in the JS code. Here&#39;s those errors fixed by now: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/0m2z02wy/2/">http://jsfiddle.net/0m2z02wy/2/</a><br/>
The problem now is that the obj parameter is undefined.<br/>
<em>Update</em><br/>
Fixed the function call. Found the problem, it&#39;s on lines 5 &amp; 12:</p>

<pre><code>var myupdate = document.getElementById(&quot;#myid&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>The function <code>getElementById</code> will already search for element id&#39;s. So there&#39;s no need to use <code>#</code> in the selector.
This is the fix:  </p>

<pre><code>var myupdate = document.getElementById(&quot;myid&quot;);
</code></pre>

<p>Here&#39;s the new code: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/0m2z02wy/4/">http://jsfiddle.net/0m2z02wy/4/</a></p>

<p>There&#39;s one more issue now, if the form is not completed you need to stop the form submit.</p>

<p><em>Update</em><br/>
Fixed by using <code>return</code> with the <code>onsubmit</code> callback. Final code: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/0m2z02wy/6/">http://jsfiddle.net/0m2z02wy/6/</a><br/>

</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re only changing the motion of one of the two balls that collide. </p>

<p>You need to change the motion vectors of <em>both</em> balls.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why my method was created totally differently to yours.</p>

<pre><code>public void handleCollision(Circle other) {
    this.dx = -this.dx;
    this.dy = -this.dy;
    other.dx = -other.dx;
    other.dy = -other.dy;
}
</code></pre>

<hr/>

<p>So, bringing it all together:</p>

<p>The loop that handles collision checks and collisions:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; ball.length-1; i++) {
    for(int j = i+1; j &lt; ball.length; j++) {
        if(ball[i].checkCollision(ball[j]) {
            ball[i].handleCollision(ball[j]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>checkCollision</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean checkCollision(Circle other){
     //Pythagorean theorem collisions
    return (Math.sqrt((Math.pow((this.x - other.x), 2) + Math.pow((this.y - other.y), 2))) &lt;= (this.r + other.r));
}
</code></pre>

<p>And finally, the <code>handleCollision</code> method:</p>

<pre><code>public void handleCollision(Circle other) {
    this.dx = -this.dx;
    this.dy = -this.dy;
    other.dx = -other.dx;
    other.dy = -other.dy;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You are using a very simple collision resolution. The solution to calculate <em>realistic</em> collision behavior would be a bit more complicated.</p>

        }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And my checkCollision and handleCollision methods:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean checkCollision(Circle other){
    boolean collides = false;
    //Pythagorean theorem collisions
    if(Math.sqrt((Math.pow((this.x - other.x), 2) + Math.pow((this.y - other.y), 2))) &lt;= (this.r + other.r)){
        collides = true;
    }
    return collides;
}

public void handleCollision(boolean collides){
    if(collides){
        this.dx = -this.dx;
        this.dy = -this.dy;

<p>Is there some reason that you aren&#39;t defining these member functions inline in the class definition? You can&#39;t put template function definitions in a .cpp file, because they need to be included in every translation unit that might instantiate them, which means they need to be in headers, and if it&#39;s already going to be in a header you might as well define it inline.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Idk, this is for an assignment and our prof taught us to define everything in a seperate cpp afaik, I&#39;ve been getting behind because Ive had so many assignments I dont have much time to study and review stuff. This current assignment is so overcomplicated for what it is and I only have today to do it and I still have no idea what exactly is needed. Ill try and get a test case and see if I can find the problem.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>On this front, you can safely ignore the book. main() <em>always</em> has a return type of int even if you don&#39;t explicitly use it (the compiler fills in a value for you, under the hood). It would be good practice to get into the habit of always creating a template main() as follows:</p>

<pre><code>int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Trust me, except for having to add a &#39;0&#39; after your &#39;return&#39; statements in main(), it won&#39;t make any functional difference to any of your existing code, and it&#39;ll make sense later so you may as well get into the habit now :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In general, you can either just write a regular for loop or an enhanced for loop to iterate through the elements of an array or arraylist.  The enhanced for loop (&quot;foreach&quot; loop) uses an iterator under the covers.  It doesn&#39;t really matter since arrays are constant-access.</p>

<p>You definitely want to use an iterator for linked lists (otherwise, accessing a particular element takes linear time and accessing every element takes quadratic time).</p>

<p>Java&#39;s checked exceptions is kind of controversial (and note that other languages, such as C#, don&#39;t have checked exceptions).  In general, checked exceptions are annoying since you have to explicitly declare that the method could throw a checked exception (or otherwise handle it in a try-catch).  If array out-of-bounds access threw a checked exception, your code would have to consider this case every time you tried to access array elements and/or you&#39;d have to put a <code>throws</code> statement at the top of your method (and every method that uses your method).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I signed up for your course. Not because I want to learn C# as I already am an experienced C# developer, but because people often ask me about good resources for beginners to learn, so I wanted to review your course.</p>

<p>I find your explanations very clear and overall this is a very good introduction for beginners that have no previous programming experience.</p>

<p>Definitely not suited for anyone already familiar with any other language though.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The book I am reading hasn&#39;t told me to do it like that.</p>

<p>It taught me to do it the way I am doing it, and it likes to say for now just do it like this until you understand this other thing.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Doing it just once, and mass-producing a device are two completely unrelated things. To do it just once, install the SSD in an external enclosure, buy a media card reader, hook it all up, and copy.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>*facepalm, totally forgot that I had to do that. Thanks. Man I am going to have a hard time learning this but I am going to keep at it no matter what.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think this is more suited for <a href="/r/doMyHomeworkForMe">/r/doMyHomeworkForMe</a> than learn programming.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>We need a real testcase, not a snippet.  There is nothing wrong with what you&#39;ve written there.  The problem must exist in how your code actually looks, not with how it looks in this snippet.  That&#39;s why snippets are so useless.  In creating a snippet, you are removing some contextual information that is crucial for answering the question, and because you don&#39;t know what the problem is that means you don&#39;t know what parts are okay to omit and which aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>I get that sometimes the actual code is too long to post, but that&#39;s where the idea of a testcase comes into play.  Remove everything except that which is strictly necessary to reproduce the problem.  If the problem is with the default constructor, then write a class that has only a default constructor, removing everything else.  You should be able to condense the problem down into 20 or 30 lines at most, while still having it remain an actual complete program that can be compiled to exhibit the problem.  Post that rather than your actual code.</p>

<p>Is there some reason that you aren&#39;t defining these member functions inline in the class definition?  You can&#39;t put template function definitions in a .cpp file, because they need to be included in every translation unit that might instantiate them, which means they need to be in headers, and if it&#39;s already going to be in a header you might as well define it inline.</p>

<p>If you learn something else and end up somewhere that uses PHP, you will be far better off than if you start learning PHP and then end up having to work on something else. </p>

<p>And if a company can&#39;t find a hosting provider that supports something other than PHP, then they aren&#39;t looking. There are plenty of providers that give you a Linux host to do whatever you want with. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m trying this, thank you</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Have you solved for combinations recursively before?  If so, you can apply that solution here.</p>

<p>Rephrase the question to:
Find all combinations of length 3 of the following set:
[ lemon, apple, cherry, lemon, apple, cherry, lemon, apple, cherry ]</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I can&#39;t see your code... How are you placing them on the board? Are they hard coded in our are you generating them in unfilled spaces? </p>

<p>If you&#39;re coding them individually, then your initial positions ought to just be kept in a list (list of structures to record both x and y positions). From here, you&#39;ll need to create a function that checks for a collision between coin and pacman, and another that removes given the result of the collision checking function. </p>

<p>tl;dr it&#39;s going to be multiple functions to handle this, and you should be using appropriate data structures.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><code>T</code> can be any type.  If you prefer, you can write <code>typename T</code> which is equivalent.  As to the second question, we need to see actual code, i.e. a complete testcase.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You could make a build script to automate this stuff.  Your favorite IDE should handle this for you, too.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is pretty sad.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s simply because you only compare 2 (in the array) adjacent balls with each other.</p>

<p>To do the full check, you need to run 2 for loops:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; ball.length-1; i++) {
    for(int j = i+1; j &lt; ball.length; j++) {
        if(ball[i].checkCollision(ball[j]) {
            ball[i].handleCollision(ball[j]);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The outer (index i) for loop only runs to balls.length-1 because the inner (index j) loop starts at i+1 and running the outer to length would cause an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds Exception.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Other than running through Rypress&#39;s Objective-C tutorial, Try Objective-C on Codeschool, and looking over Apples developer resources, notifying the professor would be the best option</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><code>T</code> can be any type. The <code>class</code> keyword here is more or less an unfortunate miswording that we are stuck with. (Which is why I prefer <code>typename</code> there.)</p>

<p>As to your error, hard to say without seeing more of your code. Did you use that syntax in the class body?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So I have this:</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 1; i &lt; ball.length; i++){   
    ball[i].handleCollision(ball[i].checkCollision(ball[i - 1]));
}
</code></pre>

<p>It&#39;s a for loop to check if the balls are colliding. It seems like 2 of the balls collide correctly but the rest just stop when they they collide and continue moving once the other one is through them.</p>

</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>So one problem is here:</p>

<pre><code>storage[i] = (byte)pii[i];

<p>storage is a pointer to a byte. So <code>storage[i]</code> gives you the i&#39;th byte. But <code>pii</code> is a pointer to an int. So <code>pii[i]</code> gives you the i&#39;th <em>int</em>. In this case, there is no i&#39;th int, because pii doesn&#39;t point to a contiguous block of ints, so you get garbage. The <code>(byte)</code> essentially truncates the garbage int to fit in a byte.</p>

<p>For some clarity, do:</p>

<pre><code>int n = 0x11223344;
char *p = (char *) &amp;n;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; sizeof n; i++) {

<p>[0][0]

</div><div class="md"><p>Remember, you need make sure that BOTH your files are linked correctly AND your JavaScript is correct.</p>

<p>For example, you&#39;re doing <code>$(&quot;.body&quot;).hide()</code> -- this is telling jQuery to look for elements with a <em>class</em> named <code>body</code> -- it&#39;s not actually going to hide the body tag itself.</p>

<p>So, let&#39;s do this -- let&#39;s try simplifying your JS even more to minimize the chances that it&#39;s your JS going wrong. Try replacing your JS with this:</p>

<pre><code>var main = function() {

$(document).ready(main);

<p>So no. Github is a reversion control. Basically:</p>

<p>You add files to a git repository (Github and git are two seperate things. Git is the program if you will, that backs up your files. Github is a website where you can get free space (2GB I think) to store your git repositories.)</p>

<p>1) You have to have git installed on your computer</p>

<p>2) Follow the steps in the empty github repository as follows:</p>

<p>Find your directory that you want to have a repository. Type &quot;git init&quot; to make a new repository.</p>

<p>Then you want to add &lt;file&gt; then commit -m &quot;My first commit!&quot; etc... just follow the link.</p>

<p>Say we had a set S = {lemon, apple, cherry}</p>

<p>S<sup>0</sup> = Ø</p>

<p>S<sup>1</sup> = S = {lemon, apple, cherry}</p>

<p>S<sup>2</sup> = SxS = {(lemon, lemon), (lemon, apple), (lemon, cherry), (apple, lemon), ...}</p>

<p>S<sup>3</sup> = Sx(SxS) = {(lemon, lemon, lemon), ...} actually {(lemon, (lemon, lemon)), ...} but you get the idea.</p>

<p>Recurse on n for S<sup>n</sup> and recurse on the cartesian product for calculating S<sup>n</sup></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You are correct, this problem is difficult because it&#39;s solved with loops, not with recursions. But sometimes you can emulate one with another. For example, if you have a tree:</p>

<pre><code>a1 [ b1, b2 [ c11, c12 ], b3 [ c21, c22 ] ]
</code></pre>

<p>it&#39;s possible to store it like this, and then iterate with loop:</p>

<pre><code>a1.1, b1.2, b2.2, c11.3, c12.3, b3.2, c21.3, c22.3
</code></pre>

<p>In your case, you have basically a 2-dimensional matrix:</p>

<pre><code>a1 a2
b1 b2
</code></pre>

<p>and it&#39;s naturally navigated with loops for rows and columns. What you can do, is transform it into tree like so:</p>

<pre><code>a1 [ a2, b2 ], b1 [ a2, b2 ]
</code></pre>

<p>which you then will be able to havigate with recursion. In other words, column (wheel) index is your recursion parameter.   </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You can use three arguments in your recursive function, the number of wheels, the number of symbols and the current depth of your recursive call, once the depth gets to the number of wheels you should terminate. If you can use global variable only the depth is needed. The function should call itself once each time. The important step is how to build the arraylist at each step. The function should return an arraylist, and at each step it should add every symbol on front of each of the already calculated combinations. This is a terrible problem for recursion but anyway, hope this helps.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think post title can be edited. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s brief enough so that I can talk/walk you through it. First, a pointer is an <em>typed</em> byte address. In other words, it refers to a byte, but it also has a type. For example:</p>

<pre><code>int *
</code></pre>

<p>is the address of the first byte of the pointed-to integer. Addresses/pointers are always the lowest numbered address where something begins.</p>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> operator returns a pointer to the data. So</p>

<pre><code>&amp;i
</code></pre>

<p>gives you the address of where i begins.</p>

<p>A key thing to note is that when you add an integer to a pointer, the address increases by the size of the associated type. So <code>&amp;i + 1</code> increases the address by the size (in byte) of an <code>int</code>. Ints are typically (but not always) 4 bytes, so <code>&amp;i + 1</code> will increase the address by 4 bytes.  So to print where an int begins, do:</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; &amp;i &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>To print the last byte, you need to play some games. First the size of a <code>char</code> is always 1. Second, you can change the associated type of a pointer by using a cast. (A cast can also change the address in the case of classes, but let&#39;s ignore that for now.) So we can force the compiler to treat the address of the int as the address of a char.</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; (char *) &amp;i + 3 &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Once <code>&amp;i</code> has been cast to a <code>(char *)</code>, then we can add 3 to it, which will bump up the address by 3 (since the size of a <code>char</code> is always 1).</p>

<p>Lastly, you can manipulate the bits in an integer by using bit operators. These, however, do not work at the address level, in memory. These work at the <code>value</code> level, and the most significant bits are always to the left. So you can print out the MSB (most significant byte) with:</p>

<pre><code>std::cout &lt;&lt; ((i &gt;&gt; 24) &amp; 0xff) &lt;&lt; std::endl;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that in a big-endian machine, the MSB is stored at the lowest numbered address of an int.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Minimal starting point: ask the user a yes or no question, providing them with yes/no buttons. When they press a button, you take them to a new view that tells them &quot;You pressed [whatever]!&quot;.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>On a high level, this is more or less what you aim to do in the helper method:</p>

<p>If the current string <code>s</code> contains <code>N-1</code> symbols, then, for each symbol <code>sym</code>, append <code>s</code> + <code>sym</code> to the ArrayList.</p>

<p>Otherwise, for each symbol <code>sym</code>, recursively call the helper method, telling it now that the current string is (<code>s</code> + <code>sym</code> + &quot; &quot;), and there is one more symbol in the string.</p>

<p>Where <code>N</code> is the number of wheels.</p>

<p>So the parameters of your recursive method should be: the current string, e.g., &quot;lemon cherry &quot;; and the number of symbols in the current string (2 in this case).</p>

<p>which is commonly recommended as a good starting point for beginners</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;m going to disagree with this -- I personally think Eloquent JavaScript is a good resource for people who are starting to approach the intermediate stage, and want to push their JavaScript knowledge to the next level, but I would never recommend it to a beginner.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I have been able to understand all the examples and work through all the exercises without peeking at the solutions until chapter 6, specifically the section titled &quot;Laying out a table&quot; about halfway down the chapter. I&#39;ve been struggling with this chapter over the past few days and I just can&#39;t grasp what&#39;s going on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t worry too much about this. Chapter 6 introduces the concept of <em>object-oriented programming</em>, and it&#39;s most likely a completely different paradigm compared to what you&#39;re used to doing. I teach a class on programming, and we always have a high number of students who were previously doing well suddenly start struggling when we hit objects. Hell, I remember it took me a full year to fully grok objects and how to use them (though in my defense, I was self-taught).</p>

<p>To make matters worse, I think Eloquent Javascript rushes though the entire topic of object-oriented programming way too quickly. This is usually a topic that I&#39;ve found beginners really need to be eased into with tons of motivating examples, and this chapter does none of it.</p>

<p>If you already have some programming introduction, it&#39;s a good introduction to how JavaScript does object-oriented programming, but like I said, I think Eloquent JavaScript is an intermediate resource, not a beginner one.</p>

<p>The other problem is that the way JavaScript does objects is a little different then how other languages do objects, so way too many tutorials get caught up on that difference and focus too much on the differences rather then just teaching from scratch, or focus on teaching all the different ways you can do objects in JS instead of teaching why you should care in the first place.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really know of a good resource off the top of my head that really teaches objects properly -- this is probably something you&#39;ll have to do tons of googling on. You may even want to try learning another programming language first -- for example, Java uses objects for everything, so Java tutorials tend to be very good on teaching the philosophy of objects.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>For a long time, I didn&#39;t use git -- or any other version control -- because I didn&#39;t see the point.  I did use it at work, because our software was in git repos, but I didn&#39;t need to share my work with anyone so I didn&#39;t really need it, right?  Then I started developing web apps and I realized that, holy shit, why would I <em>ever</em> want do do anything else?  So I have some stuff that I want to share on GitHub and some other stuff that I don&#39;t want to share on BitBucket.  And I log onto the web server, run git pull, and, voilà, instant deployment!</p>

<p>If you ever need to keep multiple copies of your work -- for example, one on a remote server, one on your local machine -- a remote repository, whether git or anything else, is absolutely critical.  Git as a deployment tool is simply <em>worlds</em> better than manually copying files!  Source control, even locally, gives you something great, which is the ability to walk back your changes.  If you fuck something up, you can recover easily.  And this is important too because sometimes you don&#39;t actually know what you&#39;re doing and you&#39;re afraid that you <em>might</em> fuck something up, but you don&#39;t need to be afraid because, if you do, you can just revert.</p>

<p>As for getting started with git, the bad news is that git is <em>really</em> complicated.  The good news is that the stuff you actually need to know is <em>really</em> simple.  99% of the time -- in my own personal project -- the only things I ever do are git status to see what files I&#39;ve changed or created and need to add to the repo, git add to add them, git commit to actually make the change, git push to get it on the remote server, and git pull to deploy.  That&#39;s it.  If you want to get fancy, you can use branches and such, but it depends on what you&#39;re trying to do.  (At work, we obviously do have to deal with branches, other people&#39;s changes, etc.)  If I ever need to do something other than what I do most often, I just google it.</p>

<p>As for multiple folders, well, that&#39;s how people choose to organize their stuff.  One of my projects is a browser game.  There&#39;s an HTML file for the game that has the JS in it.  There&#39;s a CSS file.  An FAQ in a separate HTML file.  A little further side project as another HTML file with JS in it.  All in one folder.  On the other hand, my big project is a much bigger website, with hundreds of images, text files, XML data files, deployment scripts, etc.  Those all go in folders because I&#39;m not an idiot!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the response.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not really interested in making a hugely complex application since I&#39;m only doing this in my spare time. However I want to learn something with it and maybe slowly develop it out once the basics are done. My biggest problem is really just where to start.

<p>And I find it ironic that you criticize me for dismissing Java when you throw PHP under a bus.

The fact is, though, that most individuals and small businesses can&#39;t afford to run their own web server, so they&#39;re going to go with shared hosting. It&#39;s really easy to find shared hosting with PHP and MySQL (neither of which I&#39;m fond of) but if you want to go with anything else like Rails, Django, or PostgreSQL, you&#39;re usually SOL. I wasn&#39;t giving PHP a nod because I feel it&#39;s good, I was giving it the nod because it&#39;s the Windows of web programming languages: There are better alternatives, but it&#39;s ubiquitous and easy to find people who know it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>When you read input from the console the input is not given to the scanner until the user hits enter. This also means that that newline is still in the input stream. You could toss this away by adding an empty:<br/>
<code>in.nextLine();</code> in your catch block.</p>

<p>Or better yet, just use <code>in.nextLine()</code> to read in the entered line to a String variable and then use Double.parseDouble() to convert the String to a double.</p>

<p>If the user enters your exit value (<code>-1</code>) then you should not add that value to your sum.</p>

<p>Also you probably want to place your user prompt inside or your loop.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can certainly emulate a sum type (from the perspective of the data it stores) with a discriminated union; so a <code>struct</code> with a field that has an <code>enum</code> that enumerates all of the data fields, and a <code>union</code> which holds the data (others have explored this in greater detail).</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to note that this is not all a sum type is though. Languages with sum types have particular guarantees, which they can have since they enforce a particular way to use the type (e.g. pattern matching). In C, you won&#39;t be able to replicate those kind of guarantees without some work (namely, you&#39;ll have to hide the implementation and provide interfaces for deconstructing the type into its parts).</p>

<ul>
<li>You&#39;re working with an existing C++ codebase/engine</li>
<li>You <em>really need</em> performance</li>

</ul>

<p>Writing C++ is harder than writing in higher-level programming languages.</p>

<p>Now, if you want to make a game (for the sake of making a game), you shouldn&#39;t start by making a game engine. Look for already existing game engine, and build your game with them. <a href="/r/gamedev">/r/gamedev</a> have a great FAQ this. For 3D games, Unity (C#, javascript) and Unreal Engine (C++, Blueprint system) are nice engines.</p>

<p>Now if you want to make a game because you really want to learn from building it from scratch, even if you&#39;ll never have a fully polished game, and you want to learn C++, go for it. Qt is great for making GUIs, for 2D graphics you may want to librairies like SFML.</p>

<p>For 3D graphics, again, either you go with existing 3D engine, like Ogre3D, or you use OpenGL/DirectX directly and make your own (and you should know from the start that there are non trivial math involved). Again, the question is what are your objectives.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Use a union.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yep, that&#39;s the simplest way.</p>

<p>Someone else showed an alternate way, which is to create a <code>string</code> with the correct contents and <code>cout</code> that.</p>

<pre><code>string asterisks{num_asterisks, &#39;*&#39;};

</div><div class="md"><p>If you have learned the language and its syntax, the next step is just to make stuff. You need practice to get good at any skill or sport that you pick up. Programming is the same way. Why don&#39;t you work on something that you always wanted to create when you learned how to program? Why not try to create something like pong?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It appears to stay the same, which is why the exception message will print the max amount of times and then exit to compute the sum. I feel like I need to ask for input again somewhere, but I am not sure where exactly that should be.</p>

<p>Btw This is the second advice I receive about void pointers today.</p>

<p>While I acknowledge the need for templates, I didnt realize that following the book&#39;s exercises were so much trouble;</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking of stop doing its exercises at all, as a lot of bad habits from C programming could pollute the C++ way of doing things.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Microsoft has certifications for.. NET and a ton of their development tools and software and languages. I&#39;m not sure if they are any other legitimate certifications other than having a demo tool that you&#39;ve created that shows your understanding of the major components. For C# I would include interfaces, partial classes, structs, of course all your proper access modifiers, as well as some of the other language tools that I don&#39;t want to just list. </p>

<p>Generally, people will believe you without a certificate,but if you can&#39;t deliver on what you know then that&#39;s a different problem. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It sounds like you&#39;re on the right track. Is any input removed from the scanner when you get an exception? If it wasn&#39;t being removed, wouldn&#39;t you just re-read your failed input and never accept <strong>new</strong> input?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This doesn&#39;t make sense to me:</p>

<pre><code>  for(int i = 0; i &lt; size; i++)
        storage[startBytes + i] = e[i]; 
</code></pre>

<p>Here, surely size is the size of the entire array - the for-loop is iterating over far too many items.</p>

<p>And BTW, this is really <em>not</em> how you do things in C++ - generally, any time you have a void pointer, consider that you are probably doing something wrong.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes that&#39;s true, but that&#39;s exactly how it works.</p>

<p>Once you have the Circles in an array, you can use simple loops to do the checks.</p>

<p>Even in games, the same happens. Everything needs checking against all other objects, but they do some optimizations like checking in which area which objects are and thus limit the amount of necessary checking.</p>

<p>The last part is trickier. It may be possible to do exactly as you said and send the full screen key command if audio input is detected, but I don&#39;t know how. An easier way may be to find out what TCP or UDP port DLNA connects on and have your script run netstat periodically to check for active connections on that port. </p>

<p>Another possibility that comes to mind is to automate everything from your Android with something like Tasker. You could set it to, every time DLNA launches, connect to the computer and send some commands. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Don&#39;t feel compelled to use Git. Just know it and the existence of its commands. I&#39;d recommend this great free tutorial. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rys-Git-Tutorial-Ryan-Hodson-ebook/dp/B00QFIA5OC">http://www.amazon.com/Rys-Git-Tutorial-Ryan-Hodson-ebook/dp/B00QFIA5OC</a> If you follow that from cover to cover and take brief notes then you&#39;ll know and remember Git even if its been a while since you used it. The problem with other tutorials is that they make you issue a command once and then that&#39;s it. You have to issue them multiple times to really ingrain them and practice the idea behind them. This tutorial does that. Definitely look into it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re optimizing for learning programming, you can&#39;t do much better than Python. If you&#39;re optimizing for web development employability, your top priority is building strong web development fundamentals: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. </p>

<p>Front-end fundamentals are far more important as a web developer than what backend language stack you use. This is because HTML/CSS/JavaScript are mandated in all browsers by the W3C standards body, whereas backend languages are totally optional. </p>

<p>Nail HTML/CSS/JavaScript and you&#39;ll find entry-level web work to get your web dev career started, no matter what backend language stack you choose. </p>

<p>As others have said before, if you learn programming really well in any language, and it doesn&#39;t matter what language you initially learned. Once you learn what a remote control is by playing with one, you can pickup any other brand of TV remote and use it, once you adjust to the different button layout. </p>

<p>Moreover, employability is less a factor of what languages you use but what projects you can show the world. If you have a portfolio, the job market as a whole is not going to reject you because you wrote something cool in an unfashionable language. On the other hand, if you just learn languages without building something, getting hired will be harder. </p>

<p>Priorities should be: focus on really learning programming, particularly web programming fundamental requirements, and make something cool. If your top concern is that Python isn&#39;t as popular as Java or C, your priorities are misplaced. Picking Python isn&#39;t going to stop you from starting a career if have strong fundamentals in HTML/CSS/JS and build something cool. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry, I lack the terminology to properly explain what I mean.

</div><div class="md"><p>Mostly the point of separation of concerns in real world applications is that it results in significantly less code. Let&#39;s say, for example, I wanted to make a class that describes a driving car. My car has a velocity, a direction, a color etc.. My car also has wheels. But I don&#39;t want to repeat my code 4 times so that I can describe each wheel. I&#39;d probably make a wheel class that was instantiated four times in my car class.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>What you describe is pretty much the definition of Learning.  You do something C way, only to find X way is better, so X replaces C.  This is part of what separates professional programmers from novices.  The ability to read code and analyze both its logic for accuracy, and its efficiency expressed via N.</p>

<p>So for example, maybe you only know how to work with Arrays for a given purpose.  But you have to re-instantiate that array a lot and it&#39;s sloppy.  You might consider that N<sup>4</sup> efficiency.  Then maybe you learn about Lists and no longer have to rebuild your array every time its size changes, you might think of that as N<sup>2</sup> efficiency.  Where the final goal is N<sup>0</sup> , the perfect efficiency.</p>

<p>It all just boils down to reading, putting concepts to memory, and having real world experiences to back it all up.  It&#39;s why very often when people ask these questions half the responses will be &quot;GO CODE&quot;.  The more mistakes you make, the better you become, and the more you put to memory.  Most common languages will have a well documented reference or public API you can use and should become very familiar with.  When in doubt, google it, but don&#39;t just copy/paste the first working solution.  Figure out WHY and HOW it works, and if there are alternatives.  That way you can evaluate for yourself what&#39;s best for your given circumstance before you even begin to code.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The <code>new_game</code> function is not called until you press the reset button.

<p>This means the lines before <code>def spawn_ball(direction):</code> are those who actually initialize the game.</p>

Also, your Digital Ocean VPS will be much faster than the shared hosting. If you want a great environment to learn on without limits, a VPS, especially a cheap and powerful one like Digital Ocean&#39;s, is the way to go.</p>

Very useful in the long run, 20 months of a free VPS from Digital Ocean with a free domain and a free SSL cert with the SendGrid and Stripe addons will basically get you through learning web development and making your first project for free.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Advantages of Int: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Faster operations, including searching for a specific record, if that Int were used as an index. You may think that, with modern software, comparing two strings and comparing two integers take virtually same non-existent time. However, when your code is complex enough, you may easily find yourself doing 100.000s of searches per second. Then it will matter. </p></li>
<li><p>Easier coding. You don&#39;t need to check for null.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages of String:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can have non-numeric codes, like &quot;A101-232-333&quot; or &quot;+1 (901) 121-121-22&quot;. These can sometimes be converted to numbers, but you should stop and think really hard before doing that.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes IDs are numbers, but very long ones. Example: Twitter posts are identified with numbers like &quot;579098549876473856&quot;. They take 63 bits, so they only fit into proper 64-bit integers. JavaScript, for example, doesn&#39;t work well with them. Also it&#39;s very easy to make a mistake and do something like &quot;int id = twitterObject.id&quot;, then boom, you lost half an ID. For these reasons, Twitter also provides string representations of the IDs.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Speaking of Twitter, we had a case when we replaced string IDs with number IDs in Twitter client, and that made it significantly faster (visible by eye).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why would I use digital ocean when I can get unlimited shared server  space on something like bluehost? Isn&#39;t that much better for a beginner to tinker with?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Depending on what exactly you need, that may be doable with JavaScript. It&#39;s probably the easiest programming language to learn, because you only need a browser to run it. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For loops get much easier when you think  about them in their constituent parts.</p>

<p>Variable = Value; While Variable Is/Isn&#39;t Something;Increase/Decrease Variable)</p>

<p>When you start working more with Arrays/Matrices/Lists you&#39;ll get a new appreciation for them.</p>

<p>Alternative without nesting loops, in theory this should actually generate your result faster (albeit infinitesimally unnoticeable).</p>

<pre><code>        string baseValue = &quot;*&quot;;
        int desiredSize = 6;

        while(baseValue.LastIndexOf(&quot;*&quot;) &lt; (desiredSize - 1) * 2)
        {
            baseValue += &quot; *&quot;;
        }

        for(int a = 0; a &lt; baseValue.Length; a++)
        {
            if(baseValue[a] != &#39; &#39;)
                Console.WriteLine(baseValue.Substring(0, baseValue.Length - a));
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So long as we know the size of our largest step (generated through the while loop).  We don&#39;t need to go column by column for each row.  We just generate our entire row from a substring of the largest step.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have never read <strong>Eloquent JavaScript</strong>, but <strong>Head First JavaScript Programming</strong> by Eric Freeman and Elisabeth Robson really helped me wrap my head around JavaScript.  </p>

<p>Although I recommend learning basic JavaScript first, you might want to learn jQuery, which is of course written in JavaScript, but it makes common actions so much easier. jQuery is also ubiquitous, so it is good to understand it from that viewpoint alone.  </p>

<p><strong>JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development</strong> by Jon Duckett was very good (although it does have typos and errors that they really need to correct).  </p>

<p>When I don&#39;t understand something, I usually just expose myself to other learning resources until it starts to make sense. Sometimes it just takes a slightly different explanation for it all to make sense.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There is a Clips.Net DLL, all you need to do is load Visual Studio/Whatever, load a VB project and then reference that DLL.  Boom VB + Clips in the same environment. </p>

<p><a href="http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html">http://clipsrules.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>One good rule of thumb: If it&#39;s not obvious WHY some code is there, add a comment.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Workarounds: Sometimes you need to add some code to work around a specific issue, but it might not be obvious this is required and why</li>
<li>Code ordering: Sometimes functions have to be called in a certain order, even though it looks like it shouldn&#39;t matter</li>
</ul>

<p>Explaining the why of something is probably one of the more common things I find useful in comments.</p>

<p>In terms of pros and cons, if you write good comments, there aren&#39;t many cons. But if your comments are useless (eg. just repeating what the code does), then they&#39;re a waste of space and usually end up being out of date as the code is changed.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hey! No, you are on objects, objects are funny things that you won&#39;t necessarily &quot;get&quot; from one explanation. Personally, I learnt a lot more by listening to my lectures, and then watching videos on youtube that explained OOP using different approaches until one clicked. I just looked quickly on youtube and this video seemed to stand out. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coIsvOMYEi0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coIsvOMYEi0</a>

</div><div class="md"><p>Glad it was able to help.  Most things in C# can be converted back into their C\C++ variants.  Some do not namely I don&#39;t know of a C based List, I know it was in C++ but I can&#39;t find a C reference.  Meaning you&#39;d have to use an array, but that&#39;s not that much harder here since we know the length value before doing operations.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Scanners consume tokens when they successfully read something from the input. Meaning if you call nextInt() and the next token can be interpreted as an int it will read it and consume it. Scanners do not on their own differentiate between doubles or integers, that is something you as a programmer must do.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just keep trying, you only need to learn it once and once it clicks you&#39;ll wonder what took you so long to get it.</p>

<p>Do you have any specific questions about the code?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh hell, go straight over to C#, then make applications or <a href="https://youtu.be/bRdBPr5AN_0">web pages</a> or Unity to make games.</p>

<p>I took a pretty good Python class, but the first thing I ran into is that Python changed a bunch of commands between the version I used and the version the classed used, and then again with the latest version available, so solutions and lessons online didn&#39;t match what I was trying to do with the version the class used or two versions I already had installed. Then the class version was proprietary to the class so things I learned in class wouldn&#39;t necessarily apply directly to any other version of Python. Damn.</p>

<p>Eventually I never found a use for Python, maybe I&#39;d like to <a href="http://michelanders.blogspot.com/p/creating-blender-26-python-add-on.html">script Blender someday</a>, but ...eh..maybe not.</p>

<p>Ultimately, if you are going to pursue this you are going to go to school and you&#39;ll have to adapt to what they are going to teach you. Or you get an internship with your dad&#39;s friend or some of his associates and learn what is required to get the job done in that particular field/office. So keep an open mind, take 25 minutes a day to try some things you know in a language you don&#39;t. 
Try some <a href="http://www.codebymath.com/index.php/welcome/lesson_menu">Lua</a> for fun.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You may want to look into git-flow - it really helps with version controll, hotfixes and future features and it is a good practice</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The #1 problem I&#39;ve seen with SQL queries is incorrect indexes. Queries that use WHERE&#39;s on non-indexed columns can be very slow, so that would be the first place I&#39;d look.</p>

<p>(However, using too many indexes can also lead to problems, so don&#39;t go too crazy with them)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would make a method that gets called when objects collide.</p>

<p>Basically a similar way to the <code>collidesWith</code> method from before.</p>

<p>In this method, I would change the directions.</p>

<p>What formula do you use exactly? Pythagorean theorem seems extremely reasonable.</p>

<p>I&#39;d calculate </p>

<pre><code>public boolean collidesWith(Circle other) {
    double x1 = this.x; // get the x-center of the first circle
    double x2 = other.x; // get the x-center of the second circle
    double y1 = this.y; // get the y-center of the first circle
    double y2 = other.y; // get the y-center of the second circle
    double r1 = this.r; // get the radius of the first circle
    double r2 = other.r; // get the radius of the second circle
    // Last, calculate the distance using the pythagorean theorem
    // and compare it to the sum of the two radii
    // if the distance is less or equal to the sum of the radii
    // the circles collide -&gt; return true
    return (Math.sqrt((Math.pow(x2-x1,2) + Math.pow(y2-y1,2)) &lt;= (r1 + r2))
}
</code></pre>

<p>For the <code>handleCollision</code> method I&#39;d do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>public void handleCollision(Circle other) {
   // Adjust movement vector of this
   // Adjust movement vector of other
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Basically, it&#39;s just a normal array:</p>

<pre><code>Circle[] circles = new Circle[4];
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    circles[i] = new Circle(); //call the constructor here
    // don&#39;t know what you have 
    // maybe x-pos, y-pos, radius?
}
</code></pre>

<p>Similar for an ArrayList</p>

<pre><code>List&lt;Circle&gt; circles = new ArrayList&lt;Circle&gt;();
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) {
    circles.add(new Circle()); //call the constructor here
    // don&#39;t know what you have 
    // maybe x-pos, y-pos, radius?
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I guess it&#39;s personal taste, but to me that looks less readable than just normal spacing.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not 100% on this so hopefully someone can come by to correct any mistakes.</p>

<p>The variable types you mentioned (int and double) are different sizes. Every int is the same &quot;width&quot;: 32 bits. A double is 64 bits, a float is 32-bit, a char is 16 bit, etc etc. When a scanner consumes a token, it gets the full width of the token and the program attempts to interpret that data as the desired data type.</p>

<p>In another case, .readLine(), the scanner just streams in data until it encounters a &quot;line  separator&quot; (typically \n, perhaps \r\n). </p>

<p>??? I don&#39;t understand your response. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you, I was aware that void* should not be messed with unless you respect the strict type checking of c++ and (of course) realize that void* makes objects size unknown.</p>

<p>I was trying to solve that exercise in a different way, but, in the end. I think I misunderstood it.</p>

<p>Thank you</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>To format code here, prefix every line with 4 extra spaces.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can do basically three things with a void pointer - convert it to and from a typed pointer, and test if it is null. What you can&#39;t do is extract any type information from it and so you cannot usefully use arrays of void * in C or C++ without also knowing the real types of objects that the pointers point to. This makes them pretty much  next to useless, and you should generally not use them, particularly in C++ code, where templates are the preferred option.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>what if what it does is take that variable, do transformation T and apply function F to all of its elements then spit it out as collection of type A objects?  Is that something you would put in the comments?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I assume you are wanting to have the things on the RHS line up (though your code doesn&#39;t demonstrate this)? If so, it&#39;s a matter of taste, but I would say do not do this - apart from anything else, if you introduce a new variable with a longer name, you  will have to reformat every other line, which will play hell with version control diffs. Write the code like this:</p>

<pre><code>rot_s = argv[1].lower()
rot_v = int(argv[2])
rtype = argv[3]
longer_name = argv[4]

<p><strong>edit</strong> No longer on mobile so I can give more details. You set your     setId(); method so that it takes an integer as a parameter. So when calling the function you need to pass it an integer such as student.setId(5); however you are immediately overwriting the value with your cin call.</p>

<p>So overall you have a bunch of concepts mixed up. How to solve them now?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Either remove parameter from setID, let the user enter the ID in your main method and pass the entered value to the method in the Student class.</p></li>
<li><p>Fix your return statements. Imho all of these functions could be void, but thats a design choice at this point.</p></li>

</div><div class="md"><p>C/C++ are most commonly used to write <em>native</em> applications - meaning applications that compile directly to machine code and are custom-written for a specific operating system.</p>

<p>So if you&#39;re writing a Windows application, that means you&#39;ll write Win32 or maybe MFC to build a GUI. If it&#39;s a Mac application, you&#39;ll use Objective-C or Objective-C++ and use Cocoa for the GUI. On Linux you have a choice of Qt or GTK+.</p>

<p>Alternatively, there are C++ libraries like Qt and wxWidgets that let you build a GUI once and recompile it on different operating systems. (There are others that do this, but if you want it to look like a &quot;real&quot; application on Mac &amp; Windows I&#39;d stay away from GTK+ or Tk.)</p>

<p>Yes, but <em>which bit of code</em> outputs kill? You&#39;ve shown it here by chance, so we&#39;re good to go. Imagine this: does <code>hits</code> get reset every time you reset the game? What happens if <code>hits</code> is <strong>greater</strong> than <code>locationCells.length</code>?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well that code excerpt was in a separate class. Here&#39;s how it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>  if (hits == locationCells.length){

        }


        System.out.println(result);
        return result;
    }
</code></pre>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if I understand you though. When the result is &quot;kill&quot; it&#39;ll output kill, but when result is &quot;hit&quot;, it outputs &quot;hit&quot;. So therefore, result is always changing. Could there be something wrong with the resetting of the int array?</p>

<p>The code you show here doesn&#39;t have that functionality. Make sure that whichever function determines if the ship is dead is reset on each loop. You may be getting &quot;hits&quot; but it never &quot;dies&quot; because it&#39;s already dead.</p>

<p>No, they mainly rely on standards for specific language. I.e. if it is java-project - the best way is to store it in maven-based style etc.</p>

<p>why are there multiple folders within each person&#39;s &quot;repository&quot;?</p>

<p>Either because the project in this repo consists of several folders, or because person stores multiple projects in a single repo (this may be ok if they are very small education projects and one is too lazy to create separate repo for each of them).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>1.)  For a complete beginner, don&#39;t worry about Github right now.  Github is a way of organizing your source files when working with multiple people.  It isn&#39;t hard to get a grasp of, I just don&#39;t see a point in using it at your stage.  To figure out how to practice what you&#39;ve learned, go take a shower and think to yourself.  Think of tools you can create on your computer that can make the task easier.  Think about simple games you can make, or even a game solver (soduko for example).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Well that actually makes perfect sense. I was seriously baffled.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>oh it&#39;s ok it wasn&#39;t really directed to you but to the future me (me of tomorrow morning). </p>

<p>hmm.. that .at is pretty handy eh? i should check it out tomorrow</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, the if statement right after the do, is so that it only outputs the first command one time, because without it, it just infinitely outputs the message the second time through the loop (i.e. when user says &quot;yes&quot;)</p>

<p>So I believe the conditions are correct, aren&#39;t they? </p>
</div><div class="md"><ol>
<li>l1 refers to an address in memory. </li>
<li>Then, l3 copies that address in memory, so l3 and l1 both point to the same address. </li>
<li>Then, l1 now refers to the address that l2 points to.</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ol>

<p>l3 never becomes a reference to l1; it becomes a reference to the <em>location</em> of l1&#39;s data.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh! I didn&#39;t think of that! I was a badass in HTML back in high school. I&#39;ll try that out, thanks!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Completely agree with you, big difference between senior with PhD plans and someone who has a lot of experience with this stuff. Also I&#39;ve seen too many money grabs on udemy lately to trust anything on there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>First thing that comes to mind: you can create .html files that link to all of your documents. You&#39;re basically building a webpage using HTML/CSS etc. The .html would be loaded in your browser, but the links all lead directly to your hard drive and it wouldn&#39;t require an internet connection. I have a webcomic archived on my computer this way.</p>

<p>Note: HTML/CSS aren&#39;t programming languages. If you want to use a programming language you&#39;ll have to make a GUI.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Depends on size of tables, indexes, size of data coming out, etcetc. You really just have to test and see.</p>

<p>That latter (join) is the more typical approach </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As a beginner, you should focus your energy on learning more about programming.  Unless, you are working with a group on project.  </p>

<p>The multiple folders in each repository is just the way projects are organized.  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No problem. I was tempted to give you specific examples but I think you have some foundation decisions to make before you get started down those paths.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A repository is a place that you can store a project. Many projects are spread across multiple folders. For example, Java is pretty picky about having your files in all the right folders, so you&#39;ll want to have the proper file structure if you upload your entire project to GitHub (rather than just the source files).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The while loop will only run if dead is false. Do you ever set dead to false when you start a new game? Or is dead set to true at the end of the game, and never changed?</p>

<p>Your logic/syntax is a bit wonky, but aside from that it looks like it runs.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes your do while loop seems really off.  To help you understand the do-while loop:</p>

<pre><code>do
{
    //  Do this code, then check to see if dead is false
} while (!dead);  //  In a do-while, you need the semi colon at the end
</code></pre>

<p>So, the difference between a do-while loop and a while loop is that a do-while loop lets you execute code before it checks your condition.  A while loop checks the condition first, then lets the code in its body execute if the condition is true.</p>

<pre><code>while (!dead)
{
    //  Do this code if dead is false.
{
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Didn&#39;t read everything, but just a quick note. <code>at</code> will catch out of range errors for you, preventing them from becoming hard to find bugs.</p>

<pre><code>int a1[5];
std::array&lt;int, 5&gt; a2;

a1[5] = 2134; // This is out of range. It might not crash right away, instead causing various symptoms later in the execution.
a2.at(5) = 1234; // This will throw an exception. You&#39;ll know immediately that you went out of range (your program will halt).
</code></pre>

<p><code>assert()</code> is for &quot;asserting&quot; that things are true. It&#39;s a way of helping to detect as quickly as possible that your program is going off the rails. For example, I asserted that <code>turn</code> was either 0 or 1. If somehow it took on a value other than that, I want the execution to abort immediately, because there&#39;s a bug.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>

</div><div class="md"><p>You should describe what you want your final report to look like.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>At work, we&#39;d just do whatever the programmer wanted to do, since ultimately this isn&#39;t going to be the bottleneck.</p>

<p>What if an invoice has a lot of items or if there are a lot of invoices?  At that point, you might have to think a bit more about performance, although in general, if you&#39;re manipulating data, the most performant way is to make SQL do it (rather than pulling data into memory and then writing it back).</p>

<p>If you&#39;re just displaying data to the user, presumably the data will be paginated, and as long as your page size is reasonable, it doesn&#39;t really matter too much what query you use.</p>

<p>If you use an ORM, most ORMs, I think, will use the latter approach, using just one query.  Some of the columns will contain duplicate data, although the ORM will process the data and massage it into the correct format.  (e.g. you get your one invoice with a <code>list</code> of corresponding <code>items</code>)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>let me try this out tomorrow..im positive this is a correct way of alternating moves between user and computer but its not making sense right now. I&#39;m not sure what assert is or .at() (what errors do you mean), or what a class is, but it could be a cool thing to do after I learned these things to try it for extra learning.</p>

<p>although I did make a little bit of progress. now when the user enters a position spot that&#39;s already filled, an error is displayed and I have they need to pick a valid spot. </p>

<p>what I need to fix is the computer moves. what I want it to do whenever the computer is gonna make its move, it searches from array[0] to 8, sees if its an empty spot, then if there is, it needs to check again if the spot isn&#39;t filled (probably with an &#39;O&#39;, and probably another check to see if it filled it itself from before, i.e. is the spot an &#39;X&#39; ?). then it fills the spot with the &#39;X&#39;</p>

<p>the problem I definitely know I&#39;m going to have is that the computer can&#39;t check for empty spots. because empty spot would mean  this:</p>

<p>array[0] = &#39; &#39;; </p>

<p>but when I initialized the board, I didn&#39;t initialize the elements of the array to a &#39; &#39; (empty space). I did this:</p>

<pre><code>void initializeBoard(char TTTBoard[], int TTTsize)
{
    for (int i = 0; i&lt;TTTsize; i++)
    {
        TTTBoard[i] = i + &#39;0&#39;; // because 0-8 is uniformly increased, i will help represent
                               // each number up to 8 because it also uniformly increases with i++
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>so instead, probably what I have to just do is have the computer check if the space is NOT an &#39;X&#39; or &#39;O&#39;, and if its not, fill the space with an &#39;X&#39;. I can&#39;t check if the space is empty, well..because technically it&#39;s not (cause I initialized it to i+&#39;0&#39;). </p>

<p>alright iIm gonna think about this tomorrow. sorry, probably i didn&#39;t need to write all of this to you but I think when I wake up tomorrow and read what I just wrote I&#39;ll remember what I was thinking of at this current time and solve those problems. </p>

Is Python a bad choice, no but I can totally see why he was recommended another language other than Python.

<p>Personally, I&#39;d recommend working on a responsive web app first. That would allow for the greatest amount of coverage in the initial project (desktop users, and mobile users). You could also plan an API from the beginning that your mobile app will end up using.</p>

<p>There are an insane number of tools at a programmers disposal. The hardest part is often choosing the right tools for the job. Each tool has its own pros and cons, depending on use case.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Hey I know you might be asleep so sorry (but I guess reddit doesn&#39;t get notifications pop ups)</p>

<p>TTTBoard[i] ==  i + &#39;0&#39;;</p>

<p>That worked. But I want to know why.</p>

<p>so we added this in the value in range function, right? ValueInRange checks..well is the value acceptable or not?</p>

<p>So I&#39;ll rename it to like..</p>

<p>validInput()</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s better.</p>

<p>so the problem we (or I guess me) were having was that if I entered like a 4 (to make that an &#39;O&#39;), the next time it&#39;s my turn, if I enter a 4, well it shouldn&#39;t work! because that spot is already filled! Also, when the computer picks a spot, the user can&#39;t do that as well, because well hey that spot is already filled.</p>

<p>so that actually worked, with that fix you said, but can you break it down for me?</p>

<p>TTTBoard[i] == i + &#39;0&#39;</p>

<p>so every time we put in an i (or I guess the user does), it does this (pretend user picks 4</p>

<p>TTTBoard[4] gets the value 4+&#39;0&#39;</p>

<p>&quot;the fifth element of the array is assigned the value (4+&#39;0&#39;)&quot;</p>

<p>but how did it make it &quot;stick&quot;? if the move registers, and its our turn to pick another move, how does that piece of code rejects another input of 4? its just that part im not getting. but it does work though..</p>

<hr/>

<p>i changed it to </p>

<pre><code>bool validInput(int i, int minValue, int maxValue)
{
    return (minValue &lt;= i &amp;&amp; i &lt;= maxValue) &amp;&amp; (TTTBoard[i] ==  initialValue(i)); // TTTBoard[i] == i+&#39;0&#39;; (makes it so that u cant override a slot)
}
</code></pre>

<p>and it works. but still, if you can let me know, i cant figure it out by myself</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s what I&#39;m gonna do for ya.  I&#39;m gonna level with ya.  I don&#39;t really know a lick of C but what was needed for my Freshman Engineering class: basically nothing.  All I&#39;m here for is delivering the word from the big Torvalds in the sky, know what I&#39;m sayin?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh ok; that makes sense.  Sorry.</p>

<p>I agree with you; when you first begin the game (by executing the Python program), <code>new_game</code> is NOT called.</p>

<p>So the first game that plays doesn&#39;t ever invoke <code>new_game</code>.  <code>New_game</code> is only invoked if you hit reset (so it is only called for the 2nd, 3rd, fourth, etc games).</p>

<p>However, the game is initialized in such a state that, even if you don&#39;t call <code>new_game</code>, the initial values are correctly set.</p>

<p>You can argue that this is not the best way from a stylistic perspective; the first game probably should invoke <code>new_game</code>, but instead duplicates the code.</p>

<p>For instance, <code>new_game</code> sets both scores to 0 (lines 67, 68), but for the first game, the scores already default to 0 (lines 16, 17).  <code>new_game</code> resets the paddle locations (lines 69, 70), but the paddle locations initialize to the correct values (lines 31, 35).</p>

<p>This duplication is bad because if you want to change something (e.g. you want to change the paddle spawn location), you have to change 2 places instead of one.  The ideal code would call <code>new_game</code> when the first game starts.  Similarly, <code>spawn_ball</code> is not called either for the first game, but the ball happens to start at the correct location with the correct velocity.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If web is your focus, why not build on what you know about JS and learn node? That way you can use JS on the backend as well. With new frameworks like React you can even do native mobile apps using only JS. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks a lot, I was just about to start studying C#, timing was perfect, I&#39;ll check it out and leave a comment. Do you think if I check this out is enough to learn and be able to create a few textboxes that populate info (a line of text) that comes from a database on my own?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Let me flip that around, just out of curiosity since I&#39;m not completely sure what you consider to be like assembly and not like assembly: How do you write C that is <em>not</em> like assembly?</p>

<p>EDIT: Off the top of my head, the only thing that come to mind where the source is significantly different from the assembly is binary search transformation of a switch-statement.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh okay. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Perhaps Rust would be a possible alternative when it finally gets out of alpha/beta? Although its compiler can be very finicky...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Because the native Android language is Java. Unity is also an option.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Its not really a problem, but a failure of understanding. When you press the play button, the game starts as soon as it loads. I&#39;m just failing to understand what is calling spawn_ball. </p>

<p>I know that the Reset Button works. But my understanding is that it shouldnt be automatically starting.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Look <a href="http://www.boost.org/users/faq.html">here</a> about contributing to development.</p>

<p>Boost.org is where many of the standard libraries are first &quot;born&quot;. Once the community is comfortable that all the issues are worked and well-understood, they have then been migrated into the standard.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>How much do you understand the process of App development? One thing you could do is make a simple &quot;Click window&quot; type thing that has a single button in the window and a counter that ticks up  </p>

<p>If you were on a mac I&#39;d suggest learning how Xcode does its UI creation, and looking over the developer section of apple&#39;s website could be useful  </p>

<p>On Windows, Visual Studio has Win Forms (Though I&#39;m not sure how it works, Mac dev here), and looking over MSDN (The Microsoft Developer Network) would go a long way for making native windows apps.  </p>

<p>Alternatively looking over the &#39;Handmade Hero&#39; stream would certainly be a learning experience (VODs are on youtube)<br/>
Handmade Hero being a high quality RPG built from scratch on windows using Emacs and Visual Studio (He also goes over setting up a high quality/pleasant to use dev environment on windows)  </p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Check out the Developer network of your OS maker (Microsoft, Apple) then possibly check out Handmade Hero VODs on Youtube, since its pretty neat</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That depends somewhat on your goals and time table. Normally, I would say basic data structures and algorithms, for sure:</p>

<ul>
<li>trees, graphs (and a few graph algorithms), DAGs, lists (doubly-linked, circular), hash tables, binary search trees, DFS, BFS, priority queues, state machines, skips lists, balanced binary trees (implement at least once in your life)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some would probably argue that you don&#39;t need to learn the above because you can use std:: containers, but this depends on your goals and what type of software engineer you want to be. Part of being a good engineer is having broad, but precise knowledge at a high level. For example, when would one use a radix-like sort vs a comparison-based sort. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>So what&#39;s the problem?  You&#39;ve correctly noted that <code>new_game</code> is called by the reset button.  So when you press the reset button (<code>button1</code>), <code>new_game</code> will be invoked.</p>

<p>And the reset button itself is created as part of the GUI, and the GUI is rendered on lines 210-214.  The bulk of the GUI is done by the <code>draw</code> function.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>should algorithms and data structures be the next thing that I learn? They keep coming up a lot when I ask these kinds of questions</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would help to have a compilable example, but I would wager that is an artifact of two things: not initializing the <code>maze</code> and incorrectly outputting up to the max number of elements in the maze regardless of how many characters were read.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Have you <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq#wiki_how_do_i_get_starting_making_mobile_apps.2Fandroid_apps.2Fios_apps.2Fwindows_phone_apps.3F">read the FAQ</a>?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The same difference between a method and a function.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ok, so two things.</p>

<p>First of all, you <em>really</em> shouldn&#39;t be putting anything literally within Notepad++&#39;s folder. <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++</code> should be reserved exclusively for any files which Notepad++ requires to run, and shouldn&#39;t contain any of your files at all. Rather, you should put them somewhere in <code>C:\Users\YourUserName</code>.</p>

<p>There are two reasons for this. The first is that when you update Notepad++, you don&#39;t there to be any possibility of that update overriding your code. The second reason is that semantically wrong -- your code belongs to you, not to Notepad++ (plus, what if you want to use a different text editor to work with your code?)</p>

<p>For example, this is how I personally like to organize my files:</p>

<pre><code>C:
    Program Files
    Users
        Michael
            Desktop
            Downloads
            Dropbox
                Projects
                    website-1
                    website-2
                    some-other-coding-project
                School
                Work
</code></pre>

<p>This is obviously incomplete, and you don&#39;t have to exactly replicate this format, but the core idea should hopefully be the same -- stick all of your work in your Users folder.</p>

<p>Second, back to your website.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to tentatively say that your HTML looks correct, but upon second inspection, I did see several errors with your JavaScript code. </p>

<p>I would recommend you try two things. The first is fix up the indentation for your code -- the errors will be a little more obvious if you do so. The second would be to try running your code through <a href="http://jshint.com/">jshint</a> -- it&#39;ll give you a bit more detailed breakdown of problems in your JS code then the developer console will. </p>

<p>Make sure to click the &quot;configure&quot; button at the top, and click the checkbox that says that you&#39;re using jQuery.</p>

<p>Try out those two things (fix indentation, then use jsHint), then let me know if that fixes your issues or if you get stuck again.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>To destroy the beauty of a one letter response, you can write C in a way which is basically assembly.  Torvalds has been known to say this.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Awesome! This has been so helpful,  Thanks for typing all of this out.  I know I have a lot to learn but you have certainly inspired me.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That entirely depends on what language or context you&#39;re talking about.  These terms don&#39;t have universal definitions.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Try <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e54ccf51e389b6a2a780/f7394200ee6a930291e53eedd210720efefb7245">this</a>.</p>

<p>Not sure if it matters, but my directory to those files is    </p>

<pre><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Notepad++\Projects
</code></pre>

<p>and the JavaScript files from myself and from jQuery are in the JavaScript folder-----&gt;
    (C:\Program Files(x86)\Notepad++\Projects\JavaScript).</p>

<p>I do start off from the Projects folder, and not list the entire path, but that&#39;s how CSS is and that worked so I used the same method with the JS files.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Remind Me! 48 hours.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>C.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>These days, space at that order of magnitude is virtually never an issue.  Unless you have other concerns, you should store as integers things that are <em>actually</em> integers and store as strings things that are strings unless you&#39;re the one setting the rules.</p>

<p>Artificial database primary keys fall into this bucket.  You&#39;re the one who determines how these numbers are generated, so you control whether they&#39;re non-numeric or not.</p>

<p>You give two examples of a number being used for ID purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>a student number</p>

<p>Is this <em>really</em> an integer?  Is this true for every student ID you might ever encounter?  Could it ever change to be a non-integer?</p></li>
<li><p>driver&#39;s licence </p>

<p>This is <em>definitely</em> not a number.  My California driver&#39;s license &quot;number&quot; begins with <code>E174....</code>  Same with things like zip codes.  What about zip+4?  What about postal codes in other countries that include non-numeric characters like spaces and letters?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>These are also both good examples of why you should always use an internal, artificial identifier and not rely on some external identifier.  External identifiers can change.  You can be confused about the semantics of external identifiers.  etc. etc.</p>

<p>I&#39;m in VFX, not games, but if you&#39;re looking at working in 3d games, Python is a great choice to learn for supporting the software behind the game... eg, Maya and StudioMax. Most 3d based stuff has Python 2.x apis. If you wanna work in Film or Television VFX, Python rules the roost. Houdini, Maya, Nuke, Shotgun, Max, etc all have Python apis. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So I took look over in <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>. There seems to be a focus on algorithms, so it may not be the best way to learn about the language itself.</p>

<p>I would try to do smallish, command-line programs. Are there little things in your day-to-day computer life that you find annoying, or missing? Or, do some web development in C++, for small projects. Though C++ may not be the best language for such, your goal would be for learning.</p>

<p>When you see <code>&lt;XXXXXXXXX&gt;</code> used in an example the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> are usually used to delimit the user-supplied value but aren&#39;t part of the actual value itself.  When you see an example like</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Sorry, but that sounds like a complete waste of a class to me. It&#39;s definitely true that learning how to program is in large part about internalizing the concepts. The problem is that it&#39;s pretty much impossible to do so without using something concrete and specific; or at least that no educator has figured out how to do it so far without using a real language (though it can be a pedagogical language).</p>

<p>I guess I should explain why no to C and C++. C is more for lower-level things like device drivers, embedded software, operating systems, etc. Where you need to be closer to the hardware and very efficient. C++ is generally for large applications where performance is crucial. For example, web servers (but not always), games (but not always). I personally am partial to those languages, but am trying to resist my biases here. :-)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Based on what you want to do, it sounds like not C or C++. I&#39;d probably rank the remainder as Python, C#, and Ruby; based on what you said. Java is also a consideration, though you didn&#39;t mention it.</p>

<p>By the way, how do you have an OOP class that doesn&#39;t actually teach programming?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The one question I&#39;ve been asked in every technical interview was if I knew Python or any other object oriented language beside Javascript, so don&#39;t give up on it completely. Diversify, or focus on a stack, but it&#39;s better to have taste than preferences.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You haven&#39;t dropped an ounce of productivity here at all. Elsewhere? Perhaps, but this thread has been nothing but you showing you really don&#39;t have much going on for yourself. Probably the entire reason you felt that picking a kerfuffle to begin with was a wonderful. Your advice was worthless. Its as simple as that. There are several other people who provided useful advice. Yours was useless. I don&#39;t care whether or not you feel bothered, that simply just doesn&#39;t concern me. That&#39;s not my problem. You felt bothered enough to make an initial comment, and you felt bothered enough to sling personal insults just to curb your frustration, or whatever internal conflict you&#39;re dealing with. Ultimately I don&#39;t give a damn, but I just find it funny that it even got to you much to begin with. You&#39;re an entertaining guy. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I guess it depends. Myself I liked learning with C more. Until I learned C, I was always left with more questions than answers. I always felt like I have no idea what I&#39;m doing, I didn&#39;t have a clear understanding of what&#39;s going on and I don&#39;t like not understanding something.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not suggesting that people should learn to make complex programs with C before touching Python and other high level languages. but I think it&#39;s important to learn how things work on a lower level.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I edited it, just meant get input from what the score of the round was. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think you need to force this idea into another language if you don&#39;t want. It seems that you&#39;ve associated apps with languages that you don&#39;t know. I know for a fact you can accomplish everything you need without making an app, just a website where this stuff takes place.</p>

<p>Now, you probably want to make it into an app for all of the people involved who you can&#39;t trust to open a website on their phone, login, and retrieve whatever it is they came to get. I understand that fully, but at some rate there is going to need to be some light training or instructions on what the use of the website / app is for and how to use it so why not use that time to show them how to navigate to the website?</p>

<p>Otherwise you are looking at three basic options:</p>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to develop for Android AND iOS</li>
<li>Learn one of the few languages that can compile into both of the above</li>
<li>Or use something like <a href="http://www.phonegap.com">PhoneGap</a> (allows you to create mobile apps using standardized web APIs) which will wind up costing you some money</li>
</ul>

<p>Either way, if you don&#39;t make it a website alone you are looking at either learning new languages or paying for somebody to do that hard work for you.</p>

<p>If you are looking to do this project to learn I&#39;d suggest going with the first two options. If you are sure this project is something you want to do but you don&#39;t want to be bothered learning anything new or you can&#39;t learn them quick enough to meet deadlines or something you should look into PhoneGap.</p>

<p>Apache is the most widely used HTTP server and this is an Apache configuration file.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface">WSGI</a> or <em>Web Server Gateway Interface</em> is a common way for Python-based web applications and HTTP servers to communicate with each other.</p>

<p>An HTTP request comes in to the HTTP server.  The HTTP server uses WSGI to pass the request along to the web application.  The web application does its business and sends a request back to the HTTP server (again via WSGI).  The HTTP server sends that request back to the browser.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Make the interface between player 1 and 2 common. Store both into an array. Hold the index to use (0 or 1), and flip it back and forth so that you are using one or the other in the collection based on who&#39;s turn it is.</p>

<p>Store the symbol used inside the instance of the player.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I didn&#39;t use do-while, because I like having turn represent the last player to go.</p>

<p>EDIT: Should modify using net_nomad&#39;s suggestion. Create Player class. Subclass to human and computer. Use virtual function for getMove(). One might argue that it&#39;s overkill for a small program like this, but probably a good way to learn.</p>

<pre><code>// 0 is human, 1 is computer.
int turn = 0;

while (true) {

    int input;
    char marker;

    assert(turn == 0 || turn == 1);

    assert(!checkWinner(TTTBoard));

    // Get input from user or computer, depending on turn.
    if (turn == 0) {
        input = getUserMove();
        marker = &#39;O&#39;;
    } else {
        assert(turn == 1);
        input = getComputerMove();
        marker = &#39;X&#39;;
    }

    // Use .at() and a std::array to help catch errors.
    TTTBoard.at(input) = marker;
    printBoard(TTTBoard); // prints the updated state of the board

    if (checkWinner(TTTBoar)) {
        break;
    }

    // Many ways to toggle, take your pick.
    turn ^= 1;
    // Or: turn = (turn + 1)%2;
}

// Here, turn is set to the last player to go.
// Note that you also need to check for tie.
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>hmm I feel like this is probably the way to go, I&#39;m just not understanding it well.</p>

<p>so I should write this part once:</p>

<pre><code>int input = getUserMove();
        TTTBoard[input] = &#39;O&#39;;
        printBoard(TTTBoard); // prints the updated state of the board
</code></pre>

<p>but how can I flip whos turn it is without pasting a slight copy of this ? Even if I could, wouldn&#39;t player 2&#39;s move be printing &#39;O&#39; instead of &#39;X&#39;?</p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not sure if this code below is helpful..</p>

<pre><code>char TTTopponent(char player)
{


    char opponent;
    if (player == USER) 
        opponent = COMPUTER; // COMPUTER defined as &#39;X&#39;
    else
        opponent = USER; // USER defined as &#39;O&#39;


    return opponent;
}
</code></pre>

<p>I just have this from a previous assignment. Probably not useful but anyways I&#39;m just confused from the stuff above</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You should provide more context, including screenshots of any output.  There&#39;s a chance this error has nothing to do with ImageMagick, CarrierWave, or any of this other stuff.</p>

<p>What happens if you do <code>heroku config:set WAFFLES=delicious</code> for example?  What about <code>heroku restart</code>?  What does <code>heroku logs --tail</code> show?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>One more question I forgot to ask. I wrote a collision method that uses the pythagorean theorem to check if the circles are colliding. I then have two if statements that say if collides == true then invert the change in x and change y. Is there a more efficient way to do this? I don&#39;t want to create an if statement for each possible collision of two balls.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just think of it in terms of &#39;for every value in this range, I have to do something with all the values in this other range&#39;.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example. Let&#39;s say you want to verify that all the characters in a string are a lower case letter. Let&#39;s also say, for the sake of example, there are no functions to do this already, so you have to do it all yourself.</p>

<p>You could write a nested loop to do this. It would say &#39;for every character in my string, check it&#39;s in the list of valid characters&#39;.</p>

<p>Example C code would be:</p>

<pre><code>/* Valid characters, including a space */
char alphabet[] = &quot;abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz &quot;;

/* The string to check */
char string[] = &quot;this is a string with lower case characters and spaces in it&quot;;

/* Loop control variables */
int i; /* Outer loop counter - indexes each character in the string */
int j; /* Inner loop counter - index to cycle through the alphabet */

int length_of_string = strlen(string);
int length_of_alphabet = strlen(alphabet);

/* This is the outer loop that sets i to be the &#39;current&#39; element of the string in sequence */
for (i = 0; i &lt; length_of_string; i++) {

    /*
     * This is the inner loop that checks the character number i in the string
     * against all the characters in the alphabet
     */
    for (j = 0; j &lt; length_of_alphabet; j++) {
        if (string[i] == alphabet[j]) {
            /* We found a match. Character i in string is in the alphabet */
            break;
        } 
    } 
    /* 
     * This is the end of the loop that checks current letter of the string
     * against alphabet
     */

    /* Check to see if we got to the end of the alphabet without a match */
    if (j == length_of_alphabet) {
        /* We didn&#39;t find a match */
        printf(&quot;Letter number %d is not in the alphabet!\n&quot;, i);
    }

} /* End of the loop that determines which letter of string is &#39;current&#39;
</code></pre>

<p>The key thing here is that the variable j gets reset to 0 every time the loop controlled by i completes one cycle, so the inner loop gets &#39;reset&#39;, and runs from the start, every time that the outer loop completes a single cycle.</p>

<p>Can I also ask what the syntax of this would look like for 3 or 4 items?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Let&#39;s look at how loops work in terms of with, and without them:</p>

<hr/>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; 2; i++)
{
    for(j = 0; j &lt; 2; j++)
    {
        print &quot;cats!\n&quot;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Simply enough, but how does it work without them?</p>

<p>Well we basically multiply the number of iterations of the first loop, but the second, but the third... all the way to the nth loop.</p>

<p>So with 2 loops we have: loop1 * loop2 = 2 * 2 = 4 itterations.</p>

<p>As none, loop code:</p>

<pre><code>    {
        print &quot;cats!\n&quot;    /* i = 0; j = 0; */
    }

    {
        print &quot;cats!\n&quot;    /* i = 0; j = 1; */
    }

    {
        print &quot;cats!\n&quot;    /* i = 1; j = 0; */
    }

    {
        print &quot;cats!\n&quot;    /* i = 0; j = 1; */
    }
</code></pre>

</div><div class="md"><p>Most jobs I&#39;ve seen normally require you to know more than one language regardless. In general I&#39;d say Java is probably more important to employers. But definitely don&#39;t let it stop you from learning Python. </p>

<p>One thing though, you learn Python first and you will still have to learn Java. You learn Java first and you can pick up Python without a problem just slightly different syntax.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Read the FAQ for info on those, and learn how to use Google.</p>

<p>The best way to test if jQuery and JavaScript is working is to write some code using jQuery and Javascript, and see if it does something.

</div><div class="md"><p>Just put your commands in a text file. One per line. Use the <code>-y</code> command to suppress the yes/no questions and answer yes automatically.</p>

<p>It has almost nothing to do with coding. The only reason that particular script has if statements is because it works for several different distros and it needs to decide what to run.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I feel the opposite. It isn&#39;t necessary to know some of the lower level information that is critical to creating good C programs. For example, in Python you never have to worry about pointers/references. It is much much more readable and approachable for someone starting out. You can pretty much write pseudo code and have it translate directly into a python program. While of course learning the lower level information is great, and should be done eventually, I think that newer programmers should focus on more basic concepts like iteration, recursion, basic data structures and algorithms, and application structure before adding on the extra headaches that C can provide. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Think of it this way. If you have 1 for loop that prints something 10 times it would look like this.</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10;i++)
{
      Console.Write(i);
}
</code></pre>

<p>The output is </p>

<pre><code>0123456789
</code></pre>

<p>Now what if I asked you to print that whole row 10 times. How would you do it? Well without nesting loops you would probably just copy the loops 10 times.</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10;i++)
{
      Console.Write(i);
}
 for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10;i++)
{
      Console.Write(i);
}
 for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10;i++)
{
      Console.Write(i);
}
....... and so on
</code></pre>

<p>The output would be</p>

<pre><code>0123456789
0123456789
0123456789
0123456789
0123456789
....
</code></pre>

<p>This is what nesting loops solve. Instead of having to write the loop 10 times, just put the loop once around another loop that goes 10 times. By doing that you will get 10 rows of the numbers. Let me know if this cleared anything up.</p>

<pre><code>for(int i = 0;i &lt; 10;i++)
{
      for(int j = 0; j &lt; 10;j++)
      {
           Console.Write(j);
      }
}

</div><div class="md"><p>Are you overthinking it? Say that you have to read a set of books. That&#39;s the outer loop. For each book, you have to flip through every page. That&#39;s the inner loop.</p>

<p>Or, try running this in your favorite language:</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++ {
    for (int j = 0, j &lt; 10, j++) {
        printline(&quot;Outer index: &quot;, i, &quot;;  Inner index: &quot;, j);
    }
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>To understand the purpose of abstract methods/classes, you first need to understand inheritance. Inheritance allows us to have a class extend another class, taking on all the fields/methods of the parent and allowing us to add more to it as well. You might have seen examples with a parent class like Animal, and having a child class like Zebra extend it. The Zebra class will have all the methods/fields that the Animal class does, and we can also add any we want that would be specific to a Zebra.</p>

<p>Now on to abstract.</p>

<p>We can declare classes to be abstract if we don&#39;t want it to be able to be instantiated and we want to force some behavior on the child classes.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s say you are making an application for a zoo and you want to track all the animals. It would make sense to have a parent class called Animal that contains all the properties that an animal would have (age, weight, color, ...). But, we want to make sure an Animal is never actually instantiated, because we will have a class for each species (that can contain the species specific information), so we make it abstract and have all the species specific classes extend it.</p>

<pre><code>public abstract class Animal
{
    private String name;
    private int age;
    private double weight;

    // All the getters and setters

    public abstract void makeSound();   

}
</code></pre>

<p>Because Animal is abstract, we cannot do:</p>

<pre><code>Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
</code></pre>

<p>This is nice, because we don&#39;t want any actual Animal objects. We are just using that class as a parent for the other classes to extend.</p>

<p>Now the child class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Zebra extends Animal
{
    // Automatically gets name, age, and weight fields from the parent
    // These fields can be accessed with super.getName(), super.getAge(), ....

    public void makeSound()
    {
        // Must implement this because the parent had it as abstract!
    }

}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example Animal has an abstract method called makeSound(). By making it abstract, any child class that isn&#39;t abstract must implement it.</p>

<p>This is also useful because somewhere we might have a method that can take any Animal. Because we know all Animals must have implemented the makeSound() method, we can do this:</p>

<pre><code>public doSomething(Animal a)
{
    //Some stuff...

    a.makeSound();
}
</code></pre>

<p>If we passed a Zebra into the doSomething() method, it would call makeSound() for the Zebra. If we passed in a Monkey (assuming it is a child class of Animal), it would call the makeSound() for the Monkey.</p>

<p>Me:</p>

<p>I have never actually met a professional programmer that used pseudocode or flowcharts to design programs. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are having me say something I didn&#39;t say. All too common here.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No. Unless you think languages like C++ are &quot;low-level&quot;. And even if you are only programming in &quot;high-level&quot; languages (such as?) it&#39;s hard to see how they are self-commenting. I&#39;ve certainly never seen any evidence of  useful self-commenting Haskell programs.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Contrary to what <a href="/u/exoticmatter">/u/exoticmatter</a> said, professionals use pseudocode when they want to express an algorithmic idea to another developer.  It&#39;s going to be more common where the algorithm is subtle, so you see it frequently in &quot;theoretical&quot; contexts.  As an extreme example, if I wanted to explain to someone else how to use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra&#x27;s_algorithm">Dijkstra&#39;s algorithm for the shortest path between graph nodes</a>, I&#39;d definitely use pseudocode.</p>

<p>It&#39;s important to understand that pseudocode first and foremost a communication tool.  We use it to communicate the essence of an algorithm to other people without requiring a specific language.  If the person reading the pseudocode doesn&#39;t understand the algorithm after reading your pseudocode then your pseudocode isn&#39;t doing its job.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t know the rules of cornhole, I am no closer to understanding after reading your pseudocode.</p>

<p>That said, what you&#39;ve written isn&#39;t really pseudocode, so much as a confusing program written in a little programming language you just invented on the spot.  Like, what the heck is special about <code>$</code>?  What is <code>clear</code>?  What&#39;s with every line ending with a <code>;</code>?  What is <code>goto</code> statements that refer to locations that aren&#39;t anywhere to be found in your program?  Why are some <code>if/then</code> statements on one line but others on two?</p>

<p>These don&#39;t communicate anything to me (as a human).  Worse, they actively <em>confuse</em> me.</p>

<p>Also, where is the scoring happening?  These variable seem to be getting set somewhere else?  Aren&#39;t people throwing a bag at a board with a hole and getting different amounts of points depending on where/how it lands?  Where is <code>$T1temp_score</code> ever getting set so that we can compare it to <code>$T2temp_score</code>?  None of that is in your pseudocode but is pretty integral to how this thing works.</p>

<p>The problem isn&#39;t that you&#39;re having a hard time translating your pseudocode into Java, it&#39;s that your pseudocode isn&#39;t really expressing the algorithm behind cornhole as clearly as you think it is.  That likely means you don&#39;t understand that algorithm as clearly as you think you do.</p>

<p>No, I don&#39;t. Computer languages  are all about implementation - move this to that,or call this from that. But that doesn&#39;t cover what our problem is, <em>why</em> we are moving or calling things, or <em>how</em> technically the moving and calling solves our problem.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never used an Oracle database in my life.  I&#39;m just saying that so you can see what I&#39;m doing differently.</p>

<p>First, that error message isn&#39;t helpful, but at least it comes with a precise &quot;error code.&quot;</p>

<ol>
<li>Searching: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ORA-00933">https://www.google.com/search?q=ORA-00933</a></li>
<li>Leads to:<a href="http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/errors/ora00933.php">http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/errors/ora00933.php</a></li>
<li>Which says the cause is: &quot;The SQL statement ends with an inappropriate clause.&quot;</li>
</ol>

<p>So, it appears that your <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statements &quot;ends with an inappropriate clause.&quot;  Almost certainly this means <em>at least</em> one of the lines in your <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement is wrong.  If each line is considered a separate &quot;clause&quot; — I don&#39;t know whether it is, but that would be reasonable — then the error is actually telling us the last line/clause (<code>PRIMARY KEY(FR_NO)</code>) is the culprit.</p>

<p>In SQL-ese &quot;clause&quot; means things like <code>SELECT ...</code>, <code>FROM ...</code>, <code>ORDER BY ...</code>, <code>GROUP BY ...</code>, etc.  I guess you could call that last line a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> clause or something, but it&#39;s rare to hear the word &quot;clause&quot; used like that in the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> context, so it&#39;s less clear what counts as a &quot;clause&quot; in this situation.</p>

<p>Now, I might be wrong about all of the above, but given the error message I&#39;m...</p>

<ul>
<li>99% sure it&#39;s a pure syntax error</li>
<li>90% sure at least one of the lines in the <code>(...)</code> part of the <code>CREATE TABLE ( ... )</code> statement is wrong</li>
<li>75% sure it&#39;s the <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> line</li>
</ul>

<p>Again: there&#39;s a non-zero chance all of the above is wrong, but at least we have some hypotheses to test.</p>

<p>For starters, I&#39;m going to look up some reference examples of valid Oracle <code>CREATE TABLE (...)</code> statements and see how mine differs.</p>

<ol>
<li>Searching: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+create+table">https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+create+table</a></li>

<li><p>Which has this biiiiiig example</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE hr.admin_emp (
       empno      NUMBER(5) PRIMARY KEY,
       ename      VARCHAR2(15) NOT NULL,
       ssn        NUMBER(9) ENCRYPT,
       job        VARCHAR2(10),
       mgr        NUMBER(5),

   TABLESPACE admin_tbs
   STORAGE ( INITIAL 50K);

COMMENT ON TABLE hr.admin_emp IS &#39;Enhanced employee table&#39;;
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, that&#39;s really complicated and I don&#39;t know for sure what half the stuff is doing in this example.  Nevertheless, I can spot some differences off the bat, which may or may not be important:</p>

<ol>
<li>The field names are in <code>snake_case</code> — lower case with underscores as a separator</li>
<li>The <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> is specified on the same line as the field declaration and not separately at the end</li>
</ol>

<p>Given that the error message appeared to be complaining about the last <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> line and that the example from the <em>official</em> documentation doesn&#39;t declare a primary key that way, I&#39;d say we have our first workable hypothesis.  I&#39;d try this <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement instead:</p>

<p>CREATE TABLE freshmen (
     fr_no         CHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY,
     fr_firstname  VARCHAR2(30),
     fr_lastname   VARCHAR2(30),
     fr_datejoined DATE,
     act           NUMBER(2),
     city          VARCHAR2(30)
  );</p>

<p>If this works, we know that either (1) or (2) or some combination of both were the important differences.</p>

<p>Alternatively, I might think to myself, &quot;Ok, I&#39;m not sure I know how to declare a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code> in Oracle.&quot;  That&#39;d lead me to doing...</p>

<ol>
<li>Search: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+primary+key">https://www.google.com/search?q=oracle+primary+key</a></li>
<li>Leads to: <a href="http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/primary_keys.php">http://www.techonthenet.com/oracle/primary_keys.php</a></li>
<li><p>This page has this example:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE table_name
(
  column1 datatype null/not null,
  column2 datatype null/not null,
  ...

  CONSTRAINT constraint_name PRIMARY KEY (column1, column2, ... column_n)
);
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>So, I&#39;g wager that there are (at least) two ways to declare a <code>PRIMARY KEY</code>.  If you want to do it inline, you can do it the way that the Oracle docs said.  If you want to do it at the bottom of the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement (or you want to have a primary key that involves multiple fields), you need a <code>CONSTRAINT</code> clause.</p>

<p>That would lead to me trying this with your <code>CREATE TABLE</code> statement:</p>

<pre><code>CREATE TABLE freshmen (
   fr_no         CHAR(3),
   fr_firstname  VARCHAR2(30),
   fr_lastname   VARCHAR2(30),
   fr_datejoined DATE,
   act           NUMBER(2),
   city          VARCHAR2(30),
   CONSTRAINT fr_no_primary_key PRIMARY_KEY (fr_no)
);
</code></pre>

<p>Remember, I&#39;ve never once used an Oracle database.  I&#39;ve never once looked at any of these sites before.  I don&#39;t even have an Oracle database I can test these against.  I&#39;m just applying a basic version of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method">scientific method</a> to this problem so that I can form reasonable hypothesis and conduct experiments to corroborate or falsify those hypotheses.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, and?  You haven&#39;t asked a question.  At the very least, you&#39;d need to tell us what hardware architecture and what operating system you&#39;re using, and whether you&#39;re allowed to call functions in libc or whether you&#39;re expected to make raw syscalls.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That worked thanks. Question on the output though.<br/>

In the image, what is the deal with the weird characters next to the &#39;20&#39; on the first line of the maze output? Is there a way to get rid of them?</p>

<p>Here is my print function:</p>

<pre><code>void printMaze(room maze[][MAXSIZE], int currentSize)
{
    for (int row = 0; row &lt; currentSize + 1; row++)
    {
        for (int col = 0; col &lt; currentSize; col++)
        {
            room temp;
            temp = maze[row][col];
            cout &lt;&lt; temp.getContents();
        }
        cout &lt;&lt; endl;
    }
}
</code></pre>

</div><div class="md"><p>do you ever often go back and be like WTF?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here are some that I found useful when I started</p>

<p>C#:

<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pro-NET-Framework-Experts-Voice/dp/1430242337/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426983705&amp;sr=1-6&amp;keywords=c%23">Book</a> This one covers C# and also the .NET framework</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Internet is filled with basic guides to programming on any language. Firstly learn those basics. then think of something useful you want to create, then start making working on it . Here, you&#39;ll use the basics you&#39;ve learned  but things will not be that easy. Then you start  searching around  and asking question on sites like stackexchange as how to do things if you get stuck. While searching to fix a single problem you&#39;ll probably move rejoicing a lot of sites and tutorials. </p>

<p>This will make you better and give you experience in programming as a whole.</p>

<p>Good luck</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>First of all your title is wrong and missleading.</p>

<p>Second: You might want to take a look at puppet or chef which are provisioning tools which do the things you want in different system environments (lets say you want to change your server from Debian to RedHat, most of the scripts won&#39;t work anymore due to different file locations etc.)</p>

<p>You can PM for help with puppet.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The problem with pseudocode and flowcharts is that neither of them have any standardised idea of semantics (things like lifetime of variables, concepts of references, etc.), which makes using them with languages like Java or C++ which have <em>lots</em> of semantics moot. I have never actually met a professional programmer that used pseudocode or flowcharts to design programs. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I am looking for a course on C#, I will take and write here my detailed review.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, I have no idea how else to get the logic down. When I took a couple classes on programming we used flow charts. If that tells you how long ago it was. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What does any of that have to do with Github?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Being precautious won&#39;t hurt in programming. Also, it is useful to see starting conditions of your code.</p>

<p>Of course, the fields in classes are completely separate matter...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would advise extensive reading of Uncle Bob&#39;s (Martin&#39;s) Clean Code. However, I would try to say few words about in-code comments.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, it is possible - especially given functional or strongly object-oriented languages - to write self-documenting code. How? By the power of decomposition and abstraction, of course. It is usually easier to get the algorithm when you look on 3-4 steps extracted from your code. You <em>don&#39;t need</em> comments to understand. You look at the code and you see the idea behind. Also, there are tests. They show how to use the code in practical way. For coder, a bunch of tests may say more than a book of documentation.</p>

<p>And why comments &#39;inside&#39; are bad? One of the most important rules of IT - in my opinion - is: &quot;<em>Everything will change</em>&quot;. Let us imagine situation: you work with your collegues. You are good linguist while they are not. One of them changes code yet leaves comment not changed. Then, another person - comes, changes code, leaves. And even worse! Some person comes, changes comment in such a way that is not true (as they may be not precise enough or competent enough). Code written clearly - speaks for itself.</p>

<p>When you are working on &quot;hidden code&quot;, the detail - the comments may stay that way: the code speaks for itself. However, you must understand that code should be reusable. Therefore, it may be a library which must have clear, well-written manual describing (as clear as possible!) interface connecting some &#39;foreign&#39; app with your code. Then, you create real documentation by using JavaDocs, .NET docs, Python&#39;s &quot;&quot;&quot; comments, etc. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hint: Do not use pseudocode. Especially, do not use pseudocode that bears no resemblance to your target language.</p>

<p>Please be <em>much</em> more specific.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You have the same sort of error in more than one place.</p>

<p>Really, you are not going to learn to be a programmer from having people like me point out <em>all</em> your errors - you will have to think them out for yourself. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>not many, only hundreds of them so far. I don&#39;t have any good idea how to martket it.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>So I switched the two but I am getting the same error, is that from something else or did I do it wrong?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What do you mean by collection? As of right now I have this</p>

<pre><code>    int coinX = (int) 62.5;

In order to apply anything to my problem, we have to start somewhere where you actually make an effort to help me with my problem. Everyone else understands that, but you were too thickheaded to get it. You say you wouldn&#39;t even begin to argue, yet you&#39;ve been doing exactly that. You&#39;re beyond absent minded here.

</div><div class="md"><p>You will learn more by finding out for yourself, rather than asking questions here.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What else is wrong with the code?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This:</p>

<pre><code> isblank(input[i]) &amp;&amp; i &lt; input.size();

<p>tests input[i] and then tests i - it should be the other way round (if anything, your code has other issues, but fix this first).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a programmer, mostly university programmer but now i started working and i have to use C# to create a Word Ribbon and Task Pane to use as placeholders for tags and then the user adds them to Word document. In the end of the day i have to do a Word Template creater.</p>

<p>Since at uni i don&#39;t have C# but instead Java it hasnt been hard to use C# but i still don&#39;t understand namespaces and some trivial things i really need to understand, wich are different from Java.</p>

<p>Thanks for this course i will jump some parts because i already know them but will see the namespaces and similar simple things wich make a difference.</p>

<p>PS: I&#39;m a owner of a Udemy account in wich i made a purchase of a Web Design course last Christmas for 9.99€, but as i didn&#39;t had time to go through the course tottaly forget the account and can&#39;t find wich email i used :/</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure I understand because I am not sure how I would fix it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A comment at the start of a file, and at the start of every function is my rule. There is not, in my experience, any such thing as &quot;self-documenting code&quot;.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sort of, yes and no. When you&#39;re linking to anything, the only real requirement is that the link is valid. The link doesn&#39;t necessarily have to point to something inside your project folder, or even something in your computer -- your link (for images, css, js, whatever) could point to a 3rd party url if you wanted. (However, this is called &quot;hotlinking&quot;, and is generally considered impolite unless the site explicitly allows you to do hotlinking, since it&#39;ll eat up their bandwidth, not yours. On the flipside, there are websites that are explicitly build for hotlinking -- for example, there are certain kinds of websites called &quot;Content Distribution Networks&quot; (CDNS) whose whole raison d&#39;être is to host popular CSS and JS frameworks (such as bootstrap and jQuery) and allow arbitrary websites to link to them for free for the greater good of the internet.)</p>

<p>So, to return back to your question, there&#39;s no reason why you can&#39;t link to a specific image on your computer, but when you transfer all your files over to the webhost, that link will probably be broken since you&#39;re copying your files to a completely different folder on what&#39;s likely a completely different operating system.</p>

<p>For that reason, most people will end up putting all relevant assets somewhere inside the project (copying it to the project folder) so that deploying your changes to the webhost is dramatically simplified -- you just copy-and-paste everything over, and the links will all still be valid.</p>

<p>Again, this isn&#39;t <em>required</em>, but it makes life much more convenient.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This:</p>

<pre><code>  for(i = 0; isblank(input[i]) &amp;&amp; i &lt; input.size(); ++i){}
</code></pre>

<p>attempts to use input[i] <em>before</em> you test that i is a valid index.</p>

<p>The meaning of a &quot;segmentation fault&quot; error is typically that you have tried to access some memory that isn&#39;t there or isn&#39;t yours. In this case - the memory referred to by <code>input[i]</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>how would I deal with the eol character then? The way I was thinking was that when the inner loop got to the &#39;\n&#39; character it would perform the &#39;else&#39; statement and exit the inner loop. which would reset &#39;i&#39; back to 0 for the next line.</p>

<p>The effort involved has nothing to do with anything...  You sure love talking about dicks for someone who&#39;s accusing me of snapping at others.  You sound like a frothing-at-the-mouth retard.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t even begin to argue with a retard like you.  You have presented nothing that&#39;s any kind of coherent argument, more like just some teeth-gnashing retard screams.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Come on now. At least put some effort in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s obvious you want to put effort into whatever you think this is, but I have other things I&#39;m doing, so you&#39;ll just have to settle for my half efforts.  The result is still you looking like the same buffoon, so it shouldn&#39;t matter to you.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Try using a subquery.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT contactLastName AS &quot;Last Name&quot;, creditLimit AS &quot;Credit Limit&quot;
FROM customers
WHERE creditLimit &gt; (SELECT AVG(creditLimit) from customers)
ORDER BY 2 DESC
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Probability</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Did you check your server logs?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s no reason to use <code>HAVING</code> here, although it will work.  You can use <code>WHERE</code> because the outer query has access to everything from the inner query.  You only need to use <code>HAVING</code> if you want to filter the results of a query after you&#39;ve aggregated the results.</p>

<p>You also don&#39;t want to filter based on <code>ROUND(AVG(...))</code> unless that&#39;s what you <em>really</em> want.  What if someone&#39;s salary is more than average but less than the rounded-up average?  I have a hard time imagining you&#39;d ever want to exclude that person from the list.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/tutorial-window.html">Window functions</a> are a better solution if your database supports them.  AFAIK, MySQL and SQLite3 are the only major relational database systems that don&#39;t support them.  This is what it would look like with a window function:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT c.lastName, c.creditLimit
FROM (
    SELECT customers.*, AVG(creditLimit) OVER () AS avgCreditLimit
    FROM customers
  ) AS c
WHERE c.creditLimit &gt; c.avgCreditLimit
ORDER BY c.creditLimit DESC
</code></pre>

<p>Use your database&#39;s <code>EXPLAIN</code> feature to see the difference in how these two queries are executed.  The one with the window function will only have to scan the <code>customers</code> table once while yours will likely have to do it twice (once for the inner query, once for the outer query).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Awesome, everything seems to be working (though I am trying to test the JS now)! </p>

<p>After the website is done, is it required that everything be in one folder? So, If I use a picture saved on my computer, should I copy it to my project folder and reference it from there?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay, so if you&#39;re still there to help, I checked line 49 of SQLConverterTest and that&#39;s actually not even showing up as a compile error in eclipse. One of the few lines that isn&#39;t lol. It&#39;s a constructor call for SQLConverter:</p>

<pre><code>SQLConverter conv = new SQLConverter(new StringReader(testText),null);
</code></pre>

<p>Which I checked, and, while error ridden like the rest of the application, seems to be fine and where it&#39;s supposed to be.</p>

<p>I just can&#39;t shake this feeling that I&#39;m doing something wrong here, like there&#39;s a component or application that I&#39;m totally missing that would fix everything all at once. I mean, I think this is supposed to be a stable build, and it won&#39;t even compile? That can&#39;t be right.</p>

Once you have read a few thousand C++ error messages, you will know what to look for :-) But there are some basic rules, like &quot;the types in a declaration and a definition must match exactly&quot;, and &quot;const-ness is part of a type signature&quot;.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m betting the &quot;debug assertion failed&quot; is because you access <code>line[i]</code> in the loop, but <code>i &gt;= line.size()</code>. That could happen because your condition inside the loop is <code>line[i] != &#39;\n&#39;</code> but it will never be <code>\n</code> because <code>getline</code> does not include the newline character, so <code>i</code> gets incremented until it&#39;s out of bounds.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Okay so new question, how do I train myself to stop missing stupid things like that?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There&#39;s a lot of variance. Full stack developers are usually used by smaller companies when they have a task that spans multiple technologies but none require a dedicated worker. As a result, you pretty much do everything but the kitchen sink.</p>

<p>That doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t go deep into a technology, though. Myself, I spend something like 50% of my time working with JS, maybe 40% working with Scala, and the rest is miscellanious other stuff (HTML, CSS, SQL, etc). Still lots of time to delve deep into the technologies I use the most.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I do find often find myself spread very thin, and I&#39;m unsure if the majority of what I&#39;m doing even falls into my job title.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Full stack means pretty much working with everything in your technology stack. And job titles aren&#39;t very accurate. It&#39;s normal to occasionally need to work outside of what the title describes. It shouldn&#39;t become excessive, but &quot;full stack developer&quot; has become pretty much a generic &quot;programmer&quot; title, so doesn&#39;t really mean much with regards to responsibilities.</p>

If I just go through writing perfect code, I will have learned nothing. If I just read someone else&#39;s perfect code, I will have learned very little. If I write messy code, make errors, fix errors, clean it all up, and really grind through making a program, I will learn a lot. </p>

<p>Once I complete that, THEN it would be great to read other people&#39;s solution to the problem. Because I thought of my own solution, implemented it, and solved the problem on my own. Your suggestion is to be narrow and just follow what other people. There&#39;s no creativity, originality, or innovation in doing that. </p>

<pre><code>Symbol Key:

PQR:
TTT = T
FFF = F
TTF = F
FFT = T
TFF = F
FTT = T
TFT = T
FTF = F
Is not a tautology!

<p>For this example input, only TTT should evaluate to true (nothing else).</p>

<p>I&#39;ll make a separate method for the evaluations as recommended, but moving it over should yield the same results.</p>

<p>I only posted the entire code for anyone that wanted to run it, since the problem is most likely in the loops.</p>

(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jessedietrichson">https://www.youtube.com/user/jessedietrichson</a>). You can take a look at some of the comments to see what other people think.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You would do sum=a+b after the user enter the values, yes.<br/>
Until you assign a value to a variable, it contains whatever was in that part of the memory before. It could be 0 or anything else.<br/>
When you declare a variable, it&#39;s not initialized to any value by default. it just reserve a space in memory which this variable point to and whatever was in memory there is still present, resulting in &quot;garbage&quot; values.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The declaration and the definition of the &lt;&lt; operator are different - there is a <code>const</code> missing, so they are two different, overloaded functions.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The test posts you see on the home page are how the final post should look. However, you see where the twitter box is, that is actually shortcode with the link in between it. </p>

<p>When users tweet, the link(that was submitted via the submit maps page) becomes view-able. </p>

<p>My problem right now, is I had to manually put the short code around the link that I wanted to hide. I want to figure out how to put that short code around that portion of the post automatically. </p>

<p>I&#39;m going to remove the shortcode for test post 11, as you can see, there&#39;s a link there. That link was submitted through the submit maps form. </p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. </p>

    // Compare the x-coordinates AND
    // The y-coordinates 
    // also take the Circle&#39;s radius into consideration
}
</code></pre>

<p>The collidesWith method that I defined gets a parameter <code>other</code> of type <code>Circle</code> passed. That&#39;s where the <code>other</code>comes from.</p>

<p>This is similar to the <code>compareTo</code> method of the String class.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t true though. This is the best way to repeat the mistakes of everyone else who has gone before you. The best way to become a better programmer is to read code. You see how others better than you do things, and you follow suit.</p>

<p>When in a professional setting, it is uncommon that you are the only one who has written the code you are working on. You have to be able to read someone else&#39;s code and modify it to implement the features or fix the bugs. Having a sense of what to look for comes from reading code -- not writing it.</p>

<p>Writing code is secondary.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a tip: If you have a 900-line method, and especially if that method contains basically the same 110-line block of code repeated eight times, you need to restructure your code. There is absolutely no reason that you should be copying and pasting code.</p>

<p>That one is easy to answer: Use an <code>array</code> of Circle (or an ArrayList of Circle)</p>

<p>how do I make ball1 bounce off ball2?</p>

<p>What you need is a collision test. Bascially a method that checks if the current object and another object (passed to the method) collide.</p>

<pre><code>public boolean collidesWith(Circle other) {
    // Compare the x-coordinates AND
    // The y-coordinates 
    // also take the Circle&#39;s radius into consideration

</code></pre>

<p>You&#39;ll also should think of a way <em>how</em> the balls will bounce off each other.</p>

<p>Since balls are round, you&#39;d need to perform some vector mathematics with surface normals to get realistic bouncing.</p>

<p>Generally, what happens when the <code>collidesWith</code> method returns <code>true</code> for a given circle?</p>

<li>Both circles change their direction. They bounce off each other using some force vectors. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_collision">Elastic collision</a>)</li>

</div><div class="md"><p>My friend just recently introduced me to reddit, and I thought it would be a good platform to share my videos. I&#39;ve been programming since a very young age and I&#39;m currently a senior studying computer science in college. I have plans on continuing my education to obtain a Ph.D. because my ultimate goal is to become a professor. My main focus of development is in desktop and mobile applications. I&#39;ve worked on many projects including building business management systems, professional e-sport anti-cheating systems, and instant messaging / VoIP applications. My last project was a mobile app to allow users to share videos and photos in a fun way similar to Snapchat. The app is called BounceBak and it&#39;s available on the Apple app store.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You know how to loop a certain number of times, yes? You know how to print an asterisk, yes? What I showed was how you determine how many times to loop.</p>

<p>Does that help?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As others have pointed out, you aren&#39;t intermediate by any stretch of the imagination. That&#39;s OK though. You just need to narrow your focus for a bit, and get some solid understanding under your belt.</p>

<p>I see that you dabbled with the game engines a bit. If you want to make games, understand that the programming is different from other programming projects. If you want to write database backed applications, that&#39;s different too.</p>

<p>What you should start with is deciding on a language to learn. Spend all your time only on that one language. Avoid grass-is-greener syndrome by not even looking at discussions of languages other than yours. Really learn what it means to write good code in this language.</p>

<p>For what to write, dig out that college C++ textbook you have (hopefully you didn&#39;t sell it back), and implement the exercises in your language. I&#39;m sure there will be a lot of exercises that move in a structured fashion. If you&#39;re able, share those exercises with us because there&#39;s not enough exposure to them.</p>

<p>There is also <a href="/r/dailyprogrammer">/r/dailyprogrammer</a>. Do the challenges without looking at the posted solutions. Save them all. Redo the ones you did every few weeks. Refactor the ones you did too. Keep editing the work you&#39;ve done because editing code is really important too.</p>

<p>If you want to learn to code, stop blueskying dreams of being on app stores and having your name known. If you want those things, there are much easier routes like various game makers and such. You can certainly do it that way if you want.</p>

<p>For introductory projects that are of potentially decent size, check out the game genre incremental clickers at <a href="/r/incremental_games">/r/incremental_games</a>. These games employ mechanics on timers and utilize exponential growth algorithms for power ups and achievements. Some projects are quite sophisticated. You&#39;ll learn a lot by writing one.</p>

<p>Another project direction would be a rougelike. These games are generally procedurally generated so each playthrough is unique. This is a nice aspect because being developer of the game, even you won&#39;t know what&#39;s happening next. They can be as sophisticated or simple as you like, and the community is quite helpful. Check out <a href="/r/rougelikedev">/r/rougelikedev</a></p>

<p>Learn to code and let the fruits follow later. Or focus on the fruit, and let the nerds worry about how to code.</p>

<p>Either way, I know it&#39;s hard finding a direction sometimes. Just start something and be OK with it sucking at first, but don&#39;t stay comfortable with that idea. Always improve.</p>

As far as I know the templates are free for anyone to use with WordPress.

</div><div class="md"><p>You would add it to a top-level container, such as a JFrame, JDialog, or other Window, and call Window.setVisible(true). After you make the window visible, I think the getGraphics() method should return a non-null value. So you should start your thread after after the component/window is visible; or otherwise handle the null case that would occur before the window is visible. </p>

As the <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/package-summary.html#package.description">javax.swing package documentation</a> describes, all swing objects should only be accessed by the event dispatch thread (EDT).

Practically all languages have if statements,  for loops,  while loops,  etc.  Python is a good starting language because it takes away a lot of the complexity and allows you to focus on understanding proper code flow and how a real problem can be translated into code.  </p>

<p>Once you get the hand on the basics,  switching between languages becomes pretty easy.  He is right that C or Java will be more valuable in most work places,  but unless you are looking for a job this year you have plenty of time learn new languages. </p>

<p>I personally recommend working with one solely for about a year.  I would definitely pick up something like C after that.  C requires you to understand more about how a computer actually works which is really important if you want to pursue a career in it.<br/>
In the mean time,  since you  mentioned Web design,  I would recommend working with basic Html and CSS. Just make yourself a home page and host your python projects on it. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Perfect!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That.... Makes a lot of sense. I have no idea why I didn&#39;t just do that instead. I got caught up in trying to conquer this that I didn&#39;t think outside the box. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, my bad. So in Pong, you basically set up the boundaries at the top, bottom, left and right sides of the screen for where the ball will bounce back from, right? So how would I do that when the ball will be bouncing off the back, and front of the screen? (if that makes any sense).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Makes sense, thanks.</p>

Have you tried running just this command to verify that it&#39;s not something else in the file?</p>

<p>Observations:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your case is unusual and inconsistent. Usually one would capitalize the SQL keywords (like <code>CREATE TABLE</code> and <code>VARCHAR</code>), not the identifiers you created (like <code>fr_no</code>).</li>
<li>When you have a single primary key, it&#39;s helpful to declare it where you declare the attribute. That is, use <code>fr_no CHAR(3) PRIMARY KEY</code>.</li>

</div><div class="md"><p>Perhaps I worded that a little clumsily. I meant that among any of the tons of issues you could be facing, perhaps needing to use more than one mutex could be one of them. Since you&#39;re responsible for a lot in C, it&#39;s going to be difficult for us to define the problem without more information. </p>

<p>If you can&#39;t provide your code, more information about your error might be helpful. Can you tell us exactly where and when you&#39;re getting your seg fault, and what causes it? This information should include the number of files your program has read through before the seg fault. Provide this information with the thread id for each file read. </p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;re stuck on the multithreading portion. Here&#39;s a resource that shows you how to spawn n threads that run a function (n=5 hardcoded, but you can easily change that to be read in via args); you could try modifying it a little bit to see if that helps get you past this point?: <a href="http://gribblelab.org/CBootcamp/A2_Parallel_Programming_in_C.html">http://gribblelab.org/CBootcamp/A2_Parallel_Programming_in_C.html</a></p>

<p>(one way might to be just adding in a mutex into the appropriate place that linked program to see what happens)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Getting exposure to other languages really helps you in that you become aware of certain tools you can use. If you are doing something in one language and start thinking &quot;why can&#39;t I just do it this way?&quot; It may  be worth it to do some research</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Then you should use the API provided by Oracle (OCCI) or through something like OLEDB.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ok, that makes sense. Thanks!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>OK, here&#39;s what I see:</p>

<ol>
<li>You create new <code>Random</code> instance on every loop iteration. That&#39;s specifically how you should <em>not</em> use a PRNG. Create just one instance (for example, as a static member) and use it. Word of warning: stateful PRNGs, which is pretty much all of them in C# libraries including <code>System.Random</code>, usually are not thread safe.</li>
<li><code>Player</code> class is effectively not used. You mentioned that you only wanted to &#39;try out&#39; classess, which is fine, but in a &#39;regular&#39; project you have to be careful not to leave dead (or half-dead) code lying around.</li>
<li><p><code>createPlayer</code> method - why? It does not create anything (<code>void</code> return type), it&#39;s not a static factory function, all that should be in a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>public class Player
{
    public string Name {get; private set;}
    public int Lives {get; private set;}

    public Player(string name, int lives = 5)
    {
       Name = name;
       Lives = lives;
    }
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Constructor should be in charge of fully initializing your object. In rare cases when you cannot use a constructor to do that (for example, when you have to make an async call to fully initialize an object), make the constructor private and expose static factory method returning a <code>Task&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Instead of putting <code>\n</code> manually in the <code>WriteLine</code>, either use <code>Environment.NewLine</code> with format string or an empty <code>WriteLine</code> call. Also, calling <code>Console.WriteLine(&quot;abc&quot;); Console.WriteLine(&quot;{0}Aaa&quot;, Environment.NewLine)</code> will give you <em>two</em> blank lines, since <code>WriteLine</code> uses a newline anyway. I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s what you were after or not.</p></li>
<li><p><code>plrLives = --plrLives</code> could be <code>plrLives -= 1</code>, which is probably a bit simpler.</p></li>
<li><p>Error handling: what would happen if I typed <code>&quot;abc&quot;</code> instead of a number? What would happen if I gave <code>&quot;727m&quot;</code> as an input when you&#39;re asking whether I should play again or not? What would be the desired behavior from the user perspective?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s looking pretty good :)</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Right, but getting an understanding on all of this on your own is great. Props!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Wow, good on you!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah, I&#39;m just happily surprised. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>First off, let me say that learning programming in general is important. At least you are getting a start and are learning the concepts. In addition, as a web developer, he should know that python does make for a popular server-side scripting language.</p>

<p>It is always good to know other languages as well to make yourself more marketable, but python is a good one to have under your belt anyway for backend web development. If you are wanting to get into game development, Java and C/C++ are good ones to learn, for sure, but they are not mandatory. In fact, if I remember correctly, the Unity game engine employs C# as its programming language of choice for any additional scripting you need.</p>

<p>I mentioned this in a previous thread, but I will mention it here as well. If you are still learning the basics of programming, which it seems you are, I highly recommend sticking to one programming language. Stick with that until you have learned the basics concepts of programming, such as being able to address the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>When is it best to use a for loop versus a while loop?</li>
<li>For task x, should I use a procedural or an object-oriented programming approach?</li>
<li>How can I incorporate third party libraries into my projects to make my tasks easier on me?</li>
</ol>

<p>These are example questions, but you will find that as you can start answering questions like this, you will feel more comfortable as a programmer in general. When you feel comfortable learning other programming languages, by all means feel free to pursue them. But wait until you are comfortable with the general concepts of programming so you don&#39;t just confuse yourself more than you need to.</p>

<p>I hope this helps, and I&#39;m sorry you have been in a frustrating situation. Hopefully we can help you out!</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I think starting with python is fine. I study computer science and we started with a &#39;simpler&#39; programming language too, to get to know programming and understand how everything works, and only after half a year we made the switch to java. At first I was very scared of that but what I&#39;ve found out is that apart from the syntax, many programming languages are essentially the same. You use the same forloops, the same whileloops, the same everything, you just write it slightly different (and that&#39;s easy enough to get used to once you start learning another language - and if there&#39;s something you forgot you just google for the syntax).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>How deep will you go into it?</p>

<p>I&#39;m asking because I don&#39;t need to learn the basics, just the language and its caveats. Do you think this course will be too easy for me?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What did you Google for and how were those results insufficient?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Forget the actual chromosomes.  You just need a way to generate/mutate different solutions from your current solutions, and a function that ranks solutions.  So maybe your ranking function just sums the distance between cities 1 and 2 and 2 and 3 and etc in your path.  And maybe the mutation takes a path and replaces a single city with a random other city.  Maybe the crossover is part of the path being replaced with part of another path.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not a C++ programmer but how does this work? The first loop i is set to 2 and then checked to see it i%2==0. So won&#39;t it always return false?</p>

<p>I would think the if statements needs to be: </p>

<pre><code>if n % i ==0
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you use integer division this becomes pretty simple.</p>

<pre><code>size_t number /* = whatever */;
size_t num_asterisks = number / 100;
// print out asterisks
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>That worked, thanks!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think maybe you&#39;re misunderstanding how chromosomes work. Maybe not, but I&#39;ll explain a simple implementation.</p>

<p>If I were to write this program right now, the first thing I&#39;d try to come up with is a function that can take a random n bit string and translate it to a path through my cities. Then my chromosome itself could just be any arbitrary n-bit string. I can generate these strings, look at the paths they represent,  and keep the best. Mutations could be just choosing a random character in the string and changing it. Crossovers would be just taking the first half or so of one chromosome string and appending the last half of of a different chromosome string to it.</p>

<p>Of course,  there&#39;s some things that can be changed (you don&#39;t necessarily need a string for the chromosome, nor does the chromosomes need to be arbitrarily random), but this is what runs through my mind when I think of this problem.</p>
