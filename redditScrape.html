<p>PS:  Although I&#39;m trying this route with IRC, still would love someone to chat with too for anyone else out there reading this :).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So for the code I have written, will I need to make any massive adjustments if I want to get this running on Android? I understand that I will have to add in APIs for things like bringing up the keypad to input digits, drawing textboxes, etc - but for the code that I&#39;ve written, will most of it translate over without any problems? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Its not that bad, there&#39;s not any api you need to integrate if you are just crunching numbers</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hi</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If there is one thing I am still figuring out, it&#39;s the whole public/static/void/ terminology that comes before a method. I mean, I know that a method of the &quot;void&quot; class won&#39;t be expected to return a value. </p>

<p>I&#39;m still not quite sure what &quot;public&quot; or &quot;static&quot; means before a method. I mean, every line of code here is contained within the &quot;public&quot; class I created (Neuro, in this case), and I&#39;m not really sure what the implications of that are. </p>

<p>All I really know so far in regard to those factors are:</p>

<ul>
<li><em>public static void main (String[] args) {</em> is where the program starts. </li>
<li>Everything in the main function will be run. Everything outside of the main function won&#39;t run, but will be scanned - this is why methods are placed outside the main method. </li>
<li>Void class on a method means no values are going to be returned outside of the method. </li>
</ul>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sounds like you&#39;re trying Freenode IRC.</p>

<p>I believe you have to register your nick on Freenode to chat in some channels like #C++.  Read the signon message from the server.  It&#39;s free, it&#39;s just a few IRC commands.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done something like this with bash scripts.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Script 1 writes script 2.</p></li>
<li><p>Script 1 hands all work over to script 2, then shuts down.</p></li>
<li><p>Script 2 modifies and restarts script 1,then hands work back to script 1.</p></li>
<li><p>Script 1 terminates and deletes script 2.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t know how to do it with a single file or process. I did it solely for the sake of laziness. I had a kernel that had to be compiled differently on every computer, and this was the easiest way to do it. I can&#39;t imagine doing it with a compiled program, unless you knew what the compiled binary looked like and knew a lot about the computer it was running on. Then, you could have it write over itself in ROM or RAM (if you know exactly what you&#39;re doing, down the bit), though that would be complicated to say the least.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>nice job. This should take way less than 3 seconds for something this simple by the way.Android API is kind of a pain to setup/use so good luck.</p>

<p>Now as far as the application: 
-Dont use magic number such as variable=variable *0.0001 ; the 0.0001 is a magic number you dont want that in your program.You can extract them away in a different variable with a meaningful name; if those value dont change during run time; use the Final keyword when creating the 0.0001 variable.</p>

<p>2: dont name your method parameter a,b,c;gives them meaningfull name; same with variable name.</p>

<p>3:Careful about calling function inside the static main method; this makes it so that all method will have to be static; not something you want once you do bigger project/program.</p>

<p>Programming can be a lot like that, and I enjoy it most when it is, but just go Google: &quot;Why &lt;programming language&gt; sucks&quot; and you&#39;ll find out plenty of people think plenty of languages have really stupid ideas that don&#39;t logically follow. A lot of people manage to misuse otherwise good tools, too, and so you can end up with spaghetti code everywhere sometimes, too.</p>

<p>Something like this would be better... </p>

<p>You should want to do this in three distinct parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get input</li>
<li>Generate results</li>
<li>Print results</li>
</ul>

<p>Keeping this parts separate will help in the long run. Sooner or later you&#39;ll create different functions to take care of the different parts, but for now - imo - it just looks cleaner. Half of the battle with programming is keeping things clean and easy to read.</p>

<p>Also: Don&#39;t use &quot;magic numbers&quot;, instead move them into constants up top. This way your math statements almost explain themselves. What is &quot;0.0825&quot;? What is &quot;StateTaxRate&quot;? Which is easier to understand when surrounded by a pile of code?</p>

<p>Edit: Fixed some typos on my part.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Of course, this question will definitly label me as a noob in Software development - what&#39;s the benefit of C# in this situation over C++? I have worked in C# before, but I&#39;m curious why you would suggest it.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Export your program as a jar to make an executable java archive. With that, you can double click it to open in windows or many desktop environments. If that&#39;s not satisfactory, you can use something like <a href="http://www.jar2exe.com/">jar2exe</a></p>

<p>In future just call that &#39;run the program&#39;. The Java compiler creates a bytecode that runs on the Java virtual machine, and when that code runs on the JVM that&#39;s when it makes the output &#39;Hi&#39;. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Although, I kinda get what you&#39;re saying. I know nothing of Python, but have heard it&#39;s pretty noob friendly, would that work?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, but only the same way Java would - your friends would have to install the Python interpreter. Python runs through the Python interpreter, Java runs through the JVM, but compiled languages can run on the machine directly. They don&#39;t need an intermediate peice of software to run the program.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#39;m hesitant to start on C++, because I have a friend who started on that a while ago, got frustrated, then changed majors it got so bad.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Well C++ is a massive language, yes, and getting into it as a new person can be too much I think. C is a much more simple language... in a sense. C still has a lot of things you need to learn, like manual memory management, and it has other difficulties that even experienced programmers tend to want to avoid, but it&#39;s easier to pick up C than C++. (And picking up C makes picking up C++ easier later on, too.)</p>

<p>If I were you and I were getting somewhere learning Java I&#39;d just make my friends install the JVM or I&#39;d just give up on giving it to them. </p>

Part of the main loop required a conditional jump on a flag that was set in a different part of the code, but I managed to remove a vital tiny fraction of a second from each loop by having the other bit of the code replace the conditional jump with either a non-conditional loop or a NOP depending on the status of the flag.</p>

for (x = 1; x &lt;= employees; x++) {
     &quot;How many hours for employee #x?&quot; -&gt; int Hours
     if hours over 40:
         hours - 40 -&gt; int overtime hours
         hours = 40
     end if

     &quot;Base Pay for employee #x?&quot; -&gt; double payrate;

     Compute Regular Pay
     Compute Overtime Pay
     Compute Gross Pay
     Compute Regular Tax
     Compute Federal Tax
     Computer Net Pay

     Print Stuff
end for loop, next employee
</code></pre>

<p>I don&#39;t think the for loop would be useful any other way...</p>

<p>Doing a do/while loop would be different, only slightly so: </p>

<pre><code>do
     &quot;How many hours for employee?&quot; -&gt; int Hours
     ...
     ...
     Print Stuff
     &quot;Do you want to continue (&quot;Y&quot; to continue)? :&quot; -&gt; char continue
while (continue == &#39;Y&#39; or continue &#39;y&#39;)

<p>My preference, for beginner stuff like this, is IDEONE... this way you also get results/errors/etc.</p>

<p>Second thing... I can only assume the for loop is going to be for how many employees you are working through.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve updated the code on IDEONE to show where I would go with it to start with: How many employees? 6 ... for 1 through 6...</p>

<p>To generate the numbers, think about what you will do at each step.</p>

<ul>
<li>How many hours?</li>
<li>If Hours over 40, move hours over 40 into <code>overtime</code> variable</li>
<li>Now... you have Hours and OvertimeHours variables...</li>
</ul>

<p>Rest is simple math and printing...</p>

</div><div class="md"><p><a href="/u/jesyspa">/u/jesyspa</a> explained exactly where you were wrong, but you may have missed it:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when you copy-construct g2 on line 183</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Line 183 does not use your <code>operator=</code>. It cannot use it, because <code>operator=</code> assumes two objects exist: the one you&#39;re assigning to and the one you&#39;re using for the assignment. However, on line 183 you <em>create</em> a variable <code>g2</code>. This line thus uses the copy constructor. Because you haven&#39;t defined any, it will use the compiler-generated one which is wrong.</p>

<p>Try rereading your textbook section on class memory handling, this should be explained there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What have you white boarded/psuedo coded/programmed so far?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So what specifically is your question?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is just another quirk of C++. <code>Garage g2 = g</code> creates a new object from an existing one. (Note the declarator <code>Garage</code> indicating this is an object we haven&#39;t seen before.) The language authors decided that in C++ this would be semantically identical to making a copy of the existing object. This means the language reduces <code>Garage g2 = g</code> to the simpler expression <code>Garage g2(g)</code>. (To reiterate, this is just how C++ is. If you wanted, you could make your own language with hookers and blackjack where <code>Garage g2 = g</code> would call the default constructor, then call the assignment operator. To do it one way and not the other was just a decision.)</p>

<p>The copy assignment constructor is called when you are modifying an <em>existing</em> object, for example <code>g2 = g</code> - note the lack of declarator, g2 refers to an existing object, not a new one.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In the beginning it is better to learn <em>one</em> language and to learn it <em>well</em>.</p>

<p>Trying to learn multiple languages simultaneously often leads to confusion as the concepts of one language don&#39;t fit in the other.</p>

<p>Java and Python are two fundamentally different languages. Honestly, since you are learning Java at school, stick to Java for now until you have a <em>solid</em> grasp of the language. Then you can move on.</p>

<p>HTML/CSS usually don&#39;t interfere with programming languages as they serve a completely different purpose.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not important that you know <em>many</em> languages, it&#39;s by far more important to know a language <em>well</em> and to be able to <em>program</em>. </p>

<p>Programming is <em>least</em> about the language used, it&#39;s about <em>abstraction</em>, <em>algorithmic thinking</em>, <em>problem analysis</em>, and <em>problem solving</em>. Languages are only tools to express thoughts.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>True, though this a a long term project for me and I was planning on working on 2 languages over the summer so I just wanted an idea of what would be a good language to learn</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For future, this fits in <a href="/r/techsupport">/r/techsupport</a>.</p>

<p>Well, did you refresh the view in your file manager? Is this on two different computers?</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>choose between C, C#, and Java</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Get a job fast? Toss a coin: head -&gt; Java, number -&gt; C#.</p>

<p>Learn them all and get more job opportunities in the long run? C.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>For now, I would advise you to pick just one language (Java or Python is fine, or really any other high-use language like C/C++/C#) and learn it <em>well</em>. Read beginner books, intermediate books, and advanced books on it, know it inside and out, program a few projects with it. There&#39;s not much use in half-knowing ten different languages, but knowing one language at an expert level is invaluable.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would never advocate this as a valuable certification, I wouldn&#39;t suggest people pay for it. But for people who&#39;re coming into Linux with no previous experience I think it&#39;s a good start. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a CS student at the University of Reading and Karsten is my lecturer for the module in Java. I have to say, I wish he put half as much effort into the £9,000 a year CS course as he did to this free online one...</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>ayyy your bug is in Sphere.java line 42:</p>

<pre><code>i.point.multiply(t);
</code></pre>

<p>because as opposed to normalise(), multiply() doesn&#39;t modify the vector but returns a new instance, so it should be:</p>

<pre><code>i.point = i.point.multiply(t);
</code></pre>

<p>just like in the line below with point.add() :<sup>)</sup></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, it&#39;s a quite important point that all your sequences can be expressed by a sum of polynoms.</p>

<p>This seems like a perfect fit for recursion and pass-by-reference.</p>

<p>You&#39;d have two functions. First, the callable, public functio that you pass your sequence on to (as an array). Second, the internal, private function, that may also call itself and does the actual calculation. Like this pseudocode</p>

<pre><code>polynoms(sequence) {
    p = new array_of_tuples;
    polynoms(sequence, reference_to_p);
    return p;
}

polynoms(sequence, p reference_to_an_array_of_tuples) {
    ... // calculate current_polynom_tuple and next_sequence
    p.append(current_polynom_tuple);
    polynoms(next_sequence, p);
}
</code></pre>

<p>where p can for example be an array of tuples, with each tuple consisting of the factor <em>k</em> and the exponent <em>j</em> (<code>k*x^j</code>). You could also have the recursing function return a vector and append the prior polynom <em>at the front</em>.</p>

<p>This problem is independent of your output. You could either prepare the functionality for printing to the console or implement the solution for this problem first, but for your own sanity, don&#39;t mix them up. (Btw Java != Javascript)</p>

<p>For example, let&#39;s say it&#39;s 2012 and I have to take this exact course. I design some algorithm that uses a big use of the switch statement and I have to submit the program for marks. I&#39;d do some research (by that I mean ask a lot of people in person and here/(or that SO place) to critique and refine the code and finally and they approve of it being a good algorithm.</p>

<p>Should the student first write the program in the best way possible, then <em>potentially</em> modify it in order to get full marks for the HW, but in the back of their mind know what is the better way (since sometimes the better way isn&#39;t the <em>correct</em> way - by correct I mean get the most marks for the assignment)? Is that the best way to study in college? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have <code>id</code> field in Vehicle so I can identify objects. When i print <code>g</code> and <code>g2</code> <code>id</code>s of object are the same. </p>

<p>Now that you&#39;ve made that point I&#39;m leaning C, but i&#39;m gonna talk to a few people who&#39;ve taken the classes and see which one is generally thought to be taught better and go from there. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>C will teach you more about how the computer works at a low level.  Java and C# will teach you object oriented programming.  There are more job opportunities with Java.

<p>Learn whatever your school uses in its intro to programming courses. The reason being, all of their follow on courses will be based on that language, since everyone in them should know it.</p>

<p>If you want to get a Comp Sci degree, you may just want to take it through your school since most of them will require you to take the pre req classes anyway.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, it would help you very very much. That PHP and MySQL databases you want to learn? They are going to end up on the internet at some point (assuming you stick with it and enjoy it). Well, when things like that end up on the internet 9 times out of 10 they end up on a Linux server. In fact, PHP/MySQL are freqnetly found as part of the LAMP stack. The &#39;L&#39; in LAMP? Linux. It&#39;ll be great to have some experience with it while you start to get your hands dirty with the programming. Plus, I bet you&#39;ll enjoy it. :)</p>

<ul>
<li>I added both fields to my db, then &quot;rake db:migrate&quot;</li>
<li>set the two fields :content and :content2</li>
<li>made a few posts to see that it was uploading both variables to the db</li>
<li><p>then in the views I wrote:</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The best way to estimate is if you have done similar work before. You&#39;ll have a good idea how long it will take to do it again. You&#39;ll need to add time for client changes and any other moving targets (God help you if you&#39;re programming for custom hardware being developed in parallel).</p>

<p>Some companies have standard methodologies for developing estimates, but they&#39;re worse than experience, but it lets them point to a standard they adhere to so the client feels better.</p>

<p>If you are creating estimates for a proposal, the final estimate will be chosen by the sales team. The estimate is equal to what they think the other proposals will be, minus a few weeks. This estimate will probably be half the time actually needed, but that&#39;s the development teams&#39; problem.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The problem is that recv will read everything that&#39;s available -- even if there&#39;s a newline or multiple send statements.</p>

<p>In other words, if your server does:</p>

<p>Your client recv call will likely wind up reading &quot;abc\ndef\n&quot; all as one chunk.</p>

<p>The quick way to solve this is to just split everything up as needing.  In other words, set up your client to expect something like &quot;0Guess again: &quot; or &quot;1That&#39;s correct!&quot;, and have it strip off the 0 or 1 before displaying the string.</p>

<p>The more ideal way would be to read everything that&#39;s received into a buffer and then process a message out of the buffer every time you reach a newline.</p>

<p>Also, using good names for methods and classes.  There is an entire chapter on the topic in &#39;Clean code&#39; (I highly recommended this book).  Lately I&#39;ve been putting a lot of thought into them and sometimes they change a half dozen times before I&#39;m satisfied.  What I&#39;ve noticed is it forces better overall design because if I can&#39;t name a method or class to my satisfaction it&#39;s an early warning sign of poor architecture.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A very basic level of functionality is to simply track users and their library of games, as well as have a storefront for purchasing new games.</p>

<p>Remember that you need to support both user concerns as well as game publisher concerns. So, just as much users need to be able to download games, publishers need to be able to upload game information, choose pricing information, etc. They need to be able to put up descriptions, screenshots, videos, etc. You need to track all activity, because remember, real money is changing hands. </p>

<p>And you need to be robust and flexible enough to handle various scenarios. Someone makes a purchase and then requests a refund? A chargeback on a credit card? Publisher needs to take down a game for some reason? Handling discounts and other offers? Tax concerns by region?</p>

<p>So a &quot;very basic form&quot; still involves a huge chunk of work to handle all these possible scenarios.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Basically I have the skeleton of the code completed, and I just need to complete the methods.</p>

<p>Say for a sequence of numbers [1, 1, 5, 13, 25], I need to calculate the differences between the numbers -&gt; [0, 4, 8, 12], again would be [4,4,4]. Now that the numbers are the same, the exponent of the first term is the number of steps taken, this being 2. The coefficient is the number on the final sequence dived by the factorial of the exponent, thus 4/2!, so the first term is 2x<sup>2.</sup></p>

<p>Subtract this term from each element of the original sequence. I.e from the first element subtract 2 * 1<sup>2,</sup> from the second subtract 2 * 2<sup>2</sup> etc, where x = the number of each element in the sequence, not its value. This gives [-1, -7, -13, -19, -25], which is the sequence of numbers to start the next iteration.</p>

<p>The second loop with this example yields the term -6x, and leaves the sequence [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]. Now all of the numbers in the sequence are the same, so I&#39;m done. The final term in the polynomial is the number on the final sequence, i.e. 5, and the complete polynomial is 2x<sup>2</sup> - 6x + 5.</p>

<p>I then need to use print.ln (I&#39;m assuming) to give an output where the first line is the simplest polynomial that generates the sequence, and the second line is a sequence of numbers.</p>

<p>I understand the math perfectly fine, but am seriously stuck writing the methods for the javascript.</p>

<p>Maybe, but probably not. Encryption could be used to prevent those with access to the DB from seeing the data. But do you really want to stop them from accessing the data? And the user would have to have the password, as otherwise you&#39;re not stopping anyone. And if the user loses the password, the data cannot be recovered.</p>

<p>You probably don&#39;t want to encrypt the data.</p>

<p>Why is it made in Java? Are you implying that there&#39;s a standalone desktop program that the user runs? Why not use an admin interface on the website directly? Would be easier to keep everything in one place and reduces the amount of communication that goes on. As you currently put it, you&#39;d have to make two interfaces: a programmatic one on the server and a desktop interface that interacts with the programmatic interface. Double the work!</p>

<p>IMO, shell scripting of some kind should be taught, since it&#39;s invaluable to most programmers. Taught it at my university, which included things like redirection, piping, the general way the shell works, and a variety of common linux utilities. Mandatory knowledge once you get to the OS class, since it&#39;s a wee bit hard to create an OS when you don&#39;t even understand the shell.</p>

<p>Of course, my university is one that puts a lot of emphasis on use of the command line. I&#39;ve heard of some universities where students graduate without even knowing how to use the command line. Kind of weird to see students that can write a command line program but don&#39;t know how to run it without an IDE.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I messed up . Thanks for noticing though</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s really weird how Java gave arrays the <code>length</code> field. Pretty much everywhere else won&#39;t let you access fields, but instead you&#39;ll call methods.</p>

<p>At any rate, you should be able to recognize these kinds of errors because the error message will be something like &quot;cannot find symbol&quot;. This error usually means you typoed something or the type isn&#39;t what you think it is. It&#39;s because the compiler can&#39;t find a <code>length</code> field in the object. If you know that there actually is one, you&#39;re calling it wrong (as in this case).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>At my company we work to milestones. We split these up into sub tasks and spec them out.

</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you for that explanation. I needed that. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think he meant by browsing peoples open source projects, he can learn to program.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hey!</p>

<p>You can&#39;t use Github to learn programming. Github isn&#39;t a programming language, to understand Github you must understand Git. </p>

<p>Git is a VCS (version control system). What does this mean is a way to keep your projects organized, synchronized when working with more people and also some backups.</p>

<p>How is this useful? Imagine you have a big project that spawns 2 years and 50 developers working in the same project. This is where VCS comes to be useful. But it&#39;s also useful for your small projects. </p>

<p>So imagine Git is software you have in your computer to do version control <strong>locally</strong> and then you have Github which is a <strong>remote</strong> platform for version control. It can also be used as a way of sharing projects, building a portfolio and contributing to open source projects.</p>

<p>so check the instructions to install Git in your machine then start thinkering with it.</p>

<p>USeful link: </p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://git-scm.com/doc">http://git-scm.com/doc</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/">http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I think it might come handy to become a bit familiar with the very basic commands of the command line so you might understand better Git.</p>

<p>Now if you just want to know the very basics to start right now follow this instructions:</p>

<ol>
<li> Download Git for your OS and cofigure it (plenty instructions for this in the links I gave you)</li>
<li>Open terminal window</li>
<li><p>Type:  (ignore things after // those are commentaries I put for you)</p>

<pre><code>pwd     //this will tell you your current dir
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Then type:</p>

<pre><code>ls    //this will give you a list of the thing you have in current directory(dir) try to locate dir or project you want to use version control
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Once in project type:</p>

<pre><code>git init  //this means initiate git
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Check your git status this means what is happening in your <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">staging area</a></p>

<pre><code>  git status   
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>If files in red appear you must add them, if files appear in green it means they are already added but not commited (commit means saving your changes in git)</p>

<pre><code>   git add .   //git add, the dot (.) means everything in current dir
</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Type once again: git status // so you might check changes cgoing on.</p></li>
<li><p>Now commit(save your changes)</p>

<pre><code>  git commit -m &quot;This is the first commit&quot;    //-m flag means message so it lets you type a little message so you keep track of your commits
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>If you need a cheatsheet I made this one in Github, it also has instructions for using github and gitpages which is a way of hosting static webpages for free:
<a href="https://github.com/cooervo/Git-and-Github-commands">https://github.com/cooervo/Git-and-Github-commands</a></p>

<p>EDIT: Ok you might use it to learn to program by watching other peoples projects but I would recommend to first get yourself familiarized with some language and CS basics then start contributing. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If your superclass has a constructor that takes arguments, then I believe your subclass must call at least one of them something like</p>

<pre><code>public Player( .... )
{
    super( .... );
}
</code></pre>

<p>In general, unless you are doing something specifically different in an inherited method, you should not have it in your subclass. If your superclass has a method <em>getPosition()</em>, for example, which does some calculations and returns the position of the player, and your subclass also has <em>getPosition()</em>, then anytime your code calls <em>opponent.getPosition()</em> the one in the subclass will be called. If you end up changing something in the superclass, then you will never see the change because that method is not being called.</p>

<p>If you do need to override a superclass method, make sure to do:</p>

<pre><code>@Override
public String getName()
{
    String name = super.getName();
    //do special logic here, e.g.
    String oppName = &quot;Opponent: &quot; + name;
    return oppName;
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>I would suggest starting with the new class. Create a class called &quot;Agent&quot; or whatever and put in there all the things that an agent needs. It may be possible that your Player and Opponent then become instances of the same class, instead of children of that class. If that is not possible (because they are too different), then you can create separate child classes.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>i&#39;ve gotten that far. But i have some serious problems with the constructor in player and opponent after making the superclass.
And do i delete the methods in player and opponent once i create them in the superclass?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>IMHO it is much better to learn hands on and by working through problems that you have while coding.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What errors are you getting?</p>

<p>You should be creating a third class, something like <em>Person</em> (or whatever name you want) that holds all of the common fields and methods, and then you can have </p>

<pre><code>Player extends Person
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>Opponent extends Person
</code></pre>

</div><div class="md"><p>It would have been nice if an example similar to the one I presented was in the manual, because it is such a useful chain of redirection. There are all kinds of auditing workers I can create now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Of course it&#39;s in the manual, as it describes the behaviour of the interpreter:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The following redirection operators may precede or appear anywhere within a simple command or may follow a command. Redirections are processed in the order they appear, from left to right.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or were you expecting the manual to give an example of all the ways in which redirections can be combined?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That depends on countless factors.  Some variables are allocated at locations that are fixed when the program is linked (i.e. static allocation), whereas others have locations that are determined at runtime (i.e. dynamic allocation) and can vary from run to run.  Some portions of the address space are randomized for security purposes, e.g. the stack might be located at a different place each time, so even if the spot on the stack is constant (e.g. the variable is allocated early in the program, such as at the beginning of <code>main()</code>) the virtual address may not be.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I guess I just don&#39;t like having to sign up to things to view content.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a terribly good reason if you ask me.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The redirect combination I used in the example isn&#39;t in the manual. </p>

<p>I just got creative enough to figure it out on my own yesterday to satisfy my needs of being able to back up my databases reliably doing a rsnapshot job.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No it doesn&#39;t, at least not in comparison to other contemporary languages like Java, C#, or Python.  Even something as simple as listing the contents of a directory cannot be done in standard C++, not to mention network sockets (including access to OS multiplexing primitives like select() or poll()), network protocols (HTTP, SMTP, CGI, etc.), cryptography (ciphers, hashes, TLS, etc.), bignum/bigfloat, database connectors, compression, parsers for common formats (JSON, HTML, XML, etc.), DOM apis for manipulating tree elements, serialization, images, graphics, logging, filesystem operations (split and join paths, expand globs, etc.), GUI widgets, sound, unbuffered input (e.g. curses), and on and on.  And of course those languages have all the usual things C++ has, like containers, iterators, strings, and algorithms.</p>

<p>Watch <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/GoingNative/2013/Keynote-Herb-Sutter-One-Cpp">Herb Sutter&#39;s One C++ talk</a> for an example comparison.</p>

<p>...Oh.</p>

<p>Is it likely that if I did take more programming classes that I would figure out that I could have done this earlier?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you want to learn how to use bash, you type <code>man bash</code>. Then you get the <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/bash">manual for the shell</a> and then you know exactly how to use the tool.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think most programming classes teach this explicitly (unless shell scripting is covered), because this isn&#39;t really programming. It&#39;s learning to work with a specific command line interpreter.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I went through my CS degree a couple of years ago now and I believe we covered it briefly in a systems course. In my experience, very little emphasis is put on shell work at all anymore.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>It depends on the operating system and environment, in the end, but some expectations:</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>If by position, you mean physical address, then no. If you mean virtual address, it depends. If you have a variable in global memory, then quite likely. For function allocated memory, maybe. If you allocated memory dynamically, you shouldn&#39;t expect that memory location to be the same.</p>

I went back to that lib folder, and I notice, all files have s-d after the name, except sfml-main-d.lib.
Imma change additional dependencies, I hope it helps.</p>

<p>Edit: Oh god, millions of new errors.</p>

I am not sure what to do.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not really sure what you&#39;re trying to do. You could use finalLines.Length to find out how many items the string array has.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Firstly, I&#39;d recommend you rework your XML schema. When you have a collection of something (boxes in your case), you&#39;d typically write your XML like so:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;Boxes&gt;
  &lt;Box&gt;
    &lt;Title&gt;Something&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;Tooltip&gt;It does this&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
  &lt;Box&gt;
    &lt;Title&gt;Something else&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;Tooltip&gt;It does that&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
  &lt;Box&gt;
    &lt;Title&gt;Something else again&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;Tooltip&gt;It does stuff&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
&lt;/Boxes&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now to answer your question, you can select nodes from XML using something called an XPath expression. XPath is something used to select XML nodes based on a pattern you write. If you&#39;ve ever used jQuery to find HTML nodes on a webpage, it&#39;s the same principle. In the below example, the XPath expression we use is <code>Language/Boxes/Box</code>:</p>

<pre><code>string xml = @&quot;&lt;Language&gt;
&lt;Boxes&gt;
  &lt;Box&gt;
    &lt;Title&gt;Something&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;Tooltip&gt;It does this&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
  &lt;Box&gt;
    &lt;Title&gt;Something else&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;Tooltip&gt;It does that&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
  &lt;Box&gt;
    &lt;Title&gt;Something else again&lt;/Title&gt;
    &lt;Tooltip&gt;It does stuff&lt;/Tooltip&gt;
  &lt;/Box&gt;
&lt;/Boxes&gt;
&lt;/Language&gt;&quot;;

XDocument doc = XDocument.Parse(xml);

// Select all boxes, then get the box at index 0.
XElement el = doc.XPathSelectElements(&quot;Language/Boxes/Box&quot;).ElementAt(0);

string title = el.Element(&quot;Title&quot;).Value;
string tooltip = el.Element(&quot;Tooltip&quot;).Value;

Console.WriteLine(&quot;Title = &quot; + title);
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Tooltip = &quot; + tooltip);
</code></pre>

<p>Lastly, I will just leave an example of how to loop through ALL the box elements in your XML document. And yes, it uses a foreach!</p>

<pre><code>XDocument doc = XDocument.Parse(xml);

foreach (XElement el in doc.XPathSelectElements(&quot;Language/Boxes/Box&quot;))
{
    string title = el.Element(&quot;Title&quot;).Value;
    string tooltip = el.Element(&quot;Tooltip&quot;).Value;

    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Title = &quot; + title);
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Tooltip = &quot; + tooltip);
    Console.WriteLine();
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Remember to put these using directives at the top of your file for these code samples to work:</p>

<pre><code>using System.Linq;
using System.Xml.Linq;
using System.Xml.XPath;

</div><div class="md"><p>Non-paid, <a href="http://www.cybrary.it/">http://www.cybrary.it/</a> BAM!<br/>
If you do decide to go paid then I&#39;ve found <a href="http://www.linuxacademy.com">www.linuxacademy.com</a> to be really good, which is what I&#39;m subscribed to, I haven&#39;t tried cybrary yet.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t know what vim is, but it seems to work differently. I just ran the following code:</p>

<pre><code>string input = &quot;field1;field2;field3;field4;field5;field6;&quot;;
Match match = Regex.Match(input, &quot;(.*);(.*);&quot;);
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[1].Value);
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[2].Value);
</code></pre>

<p>And the output was:</p>

<pre><code>field1;field2;field3;field4;field5
field6
</code></pre>

<p>In other words, the first parenthesis matched all the fields except the last one. If I use this code instead:</p>

<pre><code>string input = &quot;field1;field2;field3;field4;field5;field6;&quot;;
Match match = Regex.Match(input, &quot;(.*?);(.*?);&quot;);
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[1].Value);
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[2].Value);
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:</p>

<pre><code>field1
field2
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>So what I did now, thanks to <a href="/u/CNotSoSharp">/u/CNotSoSharp</a>!</p>

<pre><code>        string input = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(path);
        string[] stringSeperators = { &quot;\r\n&quot; };
        string[] lines = input.Split(stringSeperators, StringSplitOptions.None);

        foreach (string line in lines)
        {
            string[] finalLines = line.Split(&quot;,&quot;[0]);
        }
</code></pre>

<p>So now I got all the words seperate in the string array, but I want to put them in a variable. Problem is I don&#39;t know how many fields contain data; I only know that a line could contain a maximum of 6 fields. Is there a &#39;good&#39; way to do this? </p>

<p>I could add this in the foreach loop, problem is that if the line contains less than 6 fields I get an indexoutofrange exception. Is there a way around this, should I use a try/catch?</p>

<pre><code>             if (finalLines[0] != &quot;&quot;)
            {
                v1 = true;
                aantalVelden = aantalVelden + 1;
            }
            if (finalLines[1] != &quot;&quot;)
            {
                v2 = true;
                aantalVelden = aantalVelden + 1;
            }
            if (finalLines[2] != &quot;&quot;)
            {
                v3 = true;
                aantalVelden = aantalVelden + 1;
            }
            if (finalLines[3] != &quot;&quot;)
            {
                v4 = true;
                aantalVelden = aantalVelden + 1;
            }
            if (finalLines[4] != &quot;&quot;)
            {
                v5 = true;
                aantalVelden = aantalVelden + 1;
            }

</div><div class="md"><p>thanks a lot for the help man! Really new to the language my self, would not be my favorite language !</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The dot only matches one single character. So .;. would match the last letter from field1 and the first letter from field2. You need to tell how many characters you want to match by using a quantifier.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are openings in C focused jobs? Dude, show me where, seriously. Hell, I&#39;ll take a pay cut to work with a real programming language.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Can you post a link to the tutorial?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You are correct. I did not read the post.</p>

<p>In that case, learn both at the same time. Nothing helps juxtapose the differences between the two than working on implementing parallel labs in each and those differences are going to be important to understand in a role where you work extensively with both languages.</p>

<p>Once the job begins, focus on aspects of each language according to demand. That part will come more naturally &#39;cause it&#39;ll be necessity.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Meh... maybe the new revision changed it a lot? When I took the old Intro to Linux on edX, I didn&#39;t learn much of anything. I learned a lot more by taking a bash class at my local cc.</p>

<p>I think a crash course on vim and bash would be better. Install a distro on an rpi or beaglebone or an old computer. Then just dive around and less/cat out everything of interests. Figure out what&#39;s interesting. So for me that was writing scripts for cronjobs, file system tree scripts, init.d stuff, blah blah.</p>

<p>Linux has so much breadth. Everything does. Too much stuff and not enough time ever. Even when I have nothing else to do. Just start somewhere and google like crazy. Stuff will happen but it&#39;ll take time.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The dot would match any character, including the semi-colons. You can either make the quantifier &quot;lazy&quot;, like I mentioned in my comment, or you could replace the dot with [^;] which matches any character except semi-colons.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>in sublime you can run the open script with ctrl+b</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well that&#39;s true. Didn&#39;t even think about that. I&#39;ll see in 4 years :D</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The built in split function would be more efficent. So you could do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>string input = &quot;field1;field2;field3;field4;field5;field6;&quot;;
string[] splitted = input.Split(&quot;;&quot;[0]);
Console.WriteLine(splitted[0]);
</code></pre>

<p>The Regex class also has a function for splitting. You could use it like this:</p>

<pre><code>string input = &quot;field1;field2;field3;field4;field5;field6;&quot;;
string[] splitted = Regex.Split(input, &quot;;&quot;);
Console.WriteLine(splitted[1]);
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, * is a quantifier that matches the previous character zero or more times. What you really want to use is the . which matches any character. Combine these two and you can match any character, zero or more times. The thing is that the * alone will try to match as many character as possible including all the semi-colons, it&#39;s &quot;greedy&quot;. You may want to make it &quot;lazy&quot;. You do this by adding a ? after. Here&#39;s an example on how you could match the second field:</p>

<pre><code>string input = &quot;field1;field2;field3;field4;field5;field6;&quot;;
Match match = Regex.Match(input, &quot;.*?;(.*?);&quot;);
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[1].Value);

</div><div class="md"><p>Interesting thread. Let&#39;s say we have a webapp like MS Paint, but where user can share his sheet to his friends by pressing button which then generates UUID to the url. That unique sheet would be &quot;real-time&quot; meaning that everyone can draw and see others drawings at the same time.</p>

<p>How it could be done that what they only see are their own drawings? I bet I can&#39;t save those drawings to database if it&#39;s example made with Javascript canvas so how this would work architecturally?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The asterisk is <em>not</em> a &quot;wild-card&quot; in regexes - it says &quot;match zero or more occurrences of the previous character. Your code probably needs to use the dot character which matches any single character, followed by an asterisk. So <code>.*;.*</code> would match a sequence of non-semicolon characters followed by a semi-colon, followed by the remaining characters.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If it&#39;s something you did before you can somewhat guesstimate how long it will take you. If it&#39;s something new it&#39;s almost impossible. Most of the stuff we build in our system is new so we don&#39;t even bother with estimates. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>When generating a web page, PHP is either directly run <em>within</em> Apache (mod_php) or via FastCGI. Your socket server probably runs independent of this (probably via php-cli). That means 2 seperate processes, and that means no easy share of information without any form of IPC (inter-process communication).</p>

<p>You could implement a client for your socket server within the script that generates your HTML. The server could then answer the number of connections via that connection. However, since it would then be like an additional connection, subtract 1 from the result. Of course, the server needs to be able to handle concurrent connection, e.g. needs to implement non-blocking network I/O.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>A hash is as random as anything else you might generate.  There&#39;s always more data you could encode with a hash than there are unique hash values, which means there&#39;s always a non-zero (albeit very small) chance of a collision.</p>

<p>In fact, a random sequence of characters is <em>better</em> better than a hash for this scenario.  If you generate a 10-character string from [0-9a-z] you have 36<sup>10</sup> unique values and there&#39;s no requirement the same input generate the same output every time as there is with a hash — you&#39;re free to choose a totally random slug each and every time, so long as you store it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Majority of non-mobile games are written in C++. C# would probably be the second most common due to the Unity engine.</p>

<p>For mobile, objective-C is what apple uses although there are programs that can translate code into objective C for you. You can do mobile in C++/C# pretty easily now.</p>

<p>Oculus and other specialty hardware like consoles tend to have extensive api&#39;s that you can access with any number of languages. Internally they are usually mostly private languages. </p>

<p>So i would recommend C++ for game programming. With C# a close second. Likely it will depend more on what engine/hardware you want to use that will decide between the two.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for the responses I think I have a good idea on how to implement this in express now</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It puts all the items into an array. So once you add items you can access that array. ListBox1.Items.Item(i) where i is the index in the array. You can use this to access and change items in the list.</p>

<p>If you want a listboxItem to contain multiple values (not just a string or number) then you need to create a custom object that is based on the listBoxItem class. You can overwrite the toString method to control what is displayed, then have member variables such as price, quality, type of leather, etc.</p>

<p>These sites show some example creating a custom listBoxItem for car objects. The youtube tutorial shows what you want to do pretty well.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that online tutorials, videos, etc aren&#39;t helpful. I&#39;m not saying you can&#39;t learn with them. I&#39;m not saying they are evil. I&#39;m not saying the Only True Way to Learn is from books.</p>

<p>I&#39;m just saying that I think - from my personal experience and ancillary evidence like the linked study - I think that physical books add something that you can&#39;t get online.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I don&#39;t like technical books made ebooks. I have a few, but given the choice - online resources, ebooks, books - I&#39;d remove eBooks first. </p>

<p>But that&#39;s a tangent to the actual conversation here: Learning from books has value that&#39;s being casually dismissed by some.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>GitHub is a remote repository, Heroku is a web hosting service that contains a remote repository. They&#39;re kind of similar in how you might interact with them on the most basic level, but they serve very different functions. Usually you will use both (Or bitbucket in place of GitHub if you want your code to be private)</p>

<p>GitHub (or bitbucket) is a place for you to store a working copy of your code. You can use it to make working on the site with multiple people easier. </p>

<p>Heroku, although it is interfaced through git, provides a server to host your site, and actually serve up it&#39;s dynamic content to web browsers.</p>

<p>If you really want to slicken the whole process, I suggest adding in codeship. </p>

<p>The way I have my setup is, I push my code up to bitbucket, when my co-founder and I sign off on the changes, they are pulled into the master branch. My codeship account picks up on this, and begins running automated tests on the latest version of the site. If they pass, Codeship automatically pushes the latest code to Heroku, Heroku picks up on the new code, and re-deploys the site. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to handle the segfault, I think it&#39;s better, for library functions, to assume strings are read only. Part of this reasoning is because strings are immutable in GC languages like Java and C# and it works well and is quite transparent in those languages. Instead I&#39;d use const keyword everywhere appropriate and make new strings when necessary. e.g.</p>

<pre><code>const char *a = &quot;abc&quot;; // this notes that s is read only and trying to modify it is a compiler error (the string, not the pointer variable)

char *uppercase(const char *s) {
    // instead of working on the string passed in, malloc a new string
    // that you can pass back
    // with *s defined as a const, it is a compiler error to try to modify what it points to.
}

void function_that_MUST_alter_input_string(char *s) {
    // trying to pass the const char *a I defined above to this function is a compiler warning (possibly error)
}

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;d recommend Heroku.</p>

<p>Assuming the framework you&#39;ve used is compatible, Set up an account with Heroku, once you&#39;ve set it up, you can set it as a remote repository.

</div><div class="md"><p>&quot;could say&quot; because a string is an abstract concept and not a real data type in C.</p>

<p>You should learn how 3D graphics works. I won&#39;t tell you to go learn linear algebra, you do that when the time comes. But can you explain to me how a cube gets rendered onto a screen?</p>

<p>How do you turn data on the disk into pixels on your screen? </p>

<p>You want to learn C++, that&#39;s what most game engines are written in. I believe Unity is written in C#. But just learn C++.</p>

<p>A great example is the Unreal Engine, the source code of which is available online. I don&#39;t suggest studying its source at this stage, since it&#39;s quite sprawling - although you&#39;re free to.</p>

<p>The legit way to obtain it is to subscribe for $20/mo, and you can download the latest source on GitHub.</p>

<p>However, if you visit the (<strong>NSFW</strong>) website known as &quot;thepiratebay.se&quot; and hypothetically search for &quot;unreal engine source&quot;, you may hypothetically find .torrent files which may point to where you may hypothetically obtain the UE source code. </p>

<p>However this hypothetical scenario is illegal and stealing and horrifically criminal behavior.</p>

<p>Anyways, the next step is understanding how 3D graphics works on computers. You can do this by writing your own little 3D tests using OpenGL, or studying the work of others (good examples include the UE engine).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>&quot;could say&quot;?? It is exactly what it is. It is simply in no way true that making a string static makes it read-only. There exists no such connection.</p>

<p>And I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to say with the last paragraph. Your example line of code contains a string literal. It is a perfectly ordinary and fully &quot;real&quot; string literal. It is there used to initialise a static array, which will then contain a static string which is writable.</p>

<p>We&#39;re not even talking about &quot;technically correct&quot;, the fact is that your statement was completely false and misleading, and now you&#39;re trying to avoid admitting it by attitude and stock phrases.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>is it just...a picture?  There&#39;s no underlying code?  What does that have to do with this subreddit?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Quick question, I was thinking of a way to enforce a kind of safety-check.... or rather a way to NOT crash the program if something goes completely wrong. For instance, majority of MODIFY portions of my code will either give a run-time error if I try to operate on it, or do nothing to the string, but in the case of the runtime errors throwing segmentation faults... what if, say, I included a setjmp and signal handler for a SIGSEGV where it&#39;d just longjmp back to that function and output (or return NULL or something). Its not like I can test to see if data passed is read-only or read-write, correct? </p>

<p>If say, I completely forgot about the fact that declared string literals are Read-Only, and tried to operate on that, the program would segfault without even telling me what happened (unless I had to use a debugger), instead it&#39;d tell me what happened immediately. </p>

<p>I&#39;m asking because, while to me it seems like a good idea, stack unwinding (IIRC) does not free memory allocated, even if it loses a pointer to it. I could create a macro for it and only test one operation at a time to keep it from getting too out of hand though (plus declaring the variable at the top of the function so I have a reference to it... but does the stack unwinding force it to lose reference anyway? </p>

<p>Just an idea, I hate random &quot;EXIT STATUS: FAILURE&quot; messages more than anything.</p>

<p>What do i actually program on?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Basically, you need a development environment installed.  Which one depends on which programming language you&#39;re using.  For example, with C/C++ on windows I&#39;d suggest you download Visual Studio Express.  For C/C++ on linux, install clang and gvim.</p>

<p>No mater how you go about it, it&#39;s just 2 basic parts. A text editor (usually with a bunch of fancy commands to help you program faster).  And a compiler+debugger that you use to turn your text files into working executables.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>...  i&#39;ve always wanted to create video games ...</p>

<p>Probably C++.  There&#39;s plenty of other languages you can use (like Java or Python) but C++ is the standard tool in the industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>... what is the &quot;next step.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Find tutorials. Start small. And practice.  Programming is a huge field. Games in particular have a tonne of parts to learn.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Some of this is answered in the FAQ...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure someone else who&#39;s in the game industry can speak with more authority, but I&#39;d think you&#39;re best bet is to checkout C++. Additionally, I&#39;d start attending local meetup groups in you&#39;re area, finding a mentor is the best thing you can do as a beginner (my humble opinion)  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I probably should have looked there first but I&#39;m not sure how up to date those resources are</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That website is not recommended.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>But it&#39;s not that they are static that makes them read-only. A static string is writable if it is in an array variable, exactly the same as with automatic variables.</p>

<p>This assumes that the html file and the CSS file are in the same directory.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Can you be a little clearer about what exactly it is that you are trying and how it doesn&#39;t work? Show us some code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t seem to have understood what static and automatic variables are.</p>

<p>A static variable is one declared either in the static scope (outside of any function) or explicitly made static with the <code>static</code> keyword. Such variables have a fixed address outside of the stack, and are writable.</p>

<p>An automatic variable is one declared inside a function and not declared <code>static</code>. Such a variable is local to the function, and is created on the stack for each invocation of the function. It is also writable.</p>

<p>Whether a variable is static or automatic does not in any way depend on whether the type of the variable is a pointer or an array; it depends on whether it is declared inside a function, and whether the <code>static</code> keyword was used.</p>

<p>Static variables are just as modifiable as automatic variables. The reason a string created by initialising a character pointer variable with a string literal isn&#39;t writable is that you haven&#39;t created an array variable, only created a pointer variable and set it to point to a literal string. The pointer is writable, but what the pointer is pointing to isn&#39;t.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Better to use strlen() instead of the magic number 4</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but calling strlen multiple times on the same string is not ideal and storing it in a variable in this case seemed silly.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>even better would be to use strdup() instead of malloc() + strncpy().</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That&#39;s not standard C but posix</p>

<blockquote>
<p>sizeof(char) is a rather confused expression.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can kind of see that, I just think it&#39;s good habit when using other data types and is explicit about what is going there. In this case it says to me &quot;4 characters&quot; not a 4 byte number or something.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>And as a matter of terminology, a string includes a terminating null. That&#39;s what makes it a string really. Saying &quot;a string and a terminating null character&quot; is redundant.</p>

<p>Sure, just wanted to make sure theif519 understood why I used 4 and not 3 and is reminded of null characters. Off by one errors are common and even strlen doesn&#39;t include the null character.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So, if I were to apply and get accepted; I would have to give a $2000 deposit in order to hold my spot and take the course? Just making sure I&#39;m reading the FAQ correctly, because I&#39;m genuinely interested.</p>

<p>Also, <code>sizeof()</code> tells you how many <code>char</code>s large a type is; <code>sizeof(char)</code> is a rather confused expression.</p>

<p>And as a matter of terminology, a string includes a terminating null. That&#39;s what makes it a string really. Saying &quot;a string and a terminating null character&quot; is redundant.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><em>Literals</em> are in read-only memory. That is, if you declare a character pointer variable in your program and initialise it to point to the string literal &quot;hello&quot;, then that literal will be in read-only memory. If you copy the values into writable memory, that memory remains writable. Memory you allocate with <code>malloc()</code> is writable, and so are array variables, so if you put the string into one of those, it is writable. It&#39;s only the string literals that are in read-only memory.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Good call, they both do. I had no clue so I took a shot in the dark. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Guess I should have worded it better. When you add those, how do you add a value to them? For example, if I have a list box with an item named leather. How do I apply that the price for leather is $45? </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Congrats on the internship!</p>

<p>I&#39;m currently taking a C++ course and the textbook we are using is pretty good at explaining the basics. I prefer reading it than listening to my professor who is GOD AWFUL at explaining the methods of coding. </p>

<p>It&#39;s this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Starting-Out-Control-Structures-Objects/dp/0133769399/ref=sr_1_14?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428716174&amp;sr=1-14&amp;keywords=c%2B%2B">book</a>... But with a little google searching you can find the PDF file... You didn&#39;t hear it from me...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use the Command Prompt/Terminal.</p>

<p>Use your &#39;cd&#39; command to move down a folder. e.g., if I&#39;m in my C:\, then &#39;cd users&#39; will take me to the users folder. Conversely, &#39;cd ..&#39; is used to move up a level. In the same example, if I&#39;m in the users folder, &#39;cd ..&#39; will take me back up to my C drive.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;re in the folder where your python script is saved, run &#39;python FileName.py&#39; to run your script.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have two 7&quot; tablets, which is too small for me to use for this. Good advice though, hadn&#39;t really thought about it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah someone else just notified me about this mistake. I&#39;m still having a problem but at least I can see it&#39;s not because of that. Now I&#39;m having boolean trouble in qEqual and letterEqual. I realize I&#39;m going about them fairly wrong; I should be using .indexOf to find q. I feel like it&#39;s still going to give me some dumb problems though.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>.NET is pretty easy and consistent, if you want easiness I suggest it but you might have to look at tutorials for c# and c++ since those are more popular but honestly anything you can do a .net language can be done in the others it&#39;d just be the easiest transition since you know vbs</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you have a tablet, I&#39;d imagine it would have a scribble pad or something.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Look closely at what you are printing out:</p>

<pre><code>for (int f = 0; f &lt; activeRule.length; f++){
    System.out.println(activeRule[i]);

</div><div class="md"><p>Oh... I was printing activeRule[i], but I meant to be print activeRule[f]...</p>

<p>Anyway, that still doesn&#39;t solve my problem but it helps a ton. I knew it had to be something stupid lol thank you</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The one problem with learning C first, and this is by no means that big of a deal, just something to be aware of, is that a &quot;proper&quot; C++ program looks a lot different than a C program.  Yet most people that learn C first end up writing C programs but with a few C++ features thrown in.  This isn&#39;t <em>wrong</em> per-se, but it&#39;s not usually optimal.</p>

<p>They really are two very different languages, even though C is largely kept as a subset of C++.</p>

<p>That said, I do think it&#39;s worth learning C first if the goal is to learn both.  I think there&#39;s something to be said for learning the more limiting one first.</p>

<p>But there&#39;s no reason to learn C first if your goal is just to learn C++, and we should stop teaching C++ as if it were just C with extra features.  Sorry, pet peeve of mine there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Here&#39;s a question, is it placed in read only because it&#39;s value was decided before it was compiled (as in its wrapped in parentheses so it has to be typed by user or a preprocessor macro), what if it&#39;s user input which is decided at runtime, is that also put in read only space?</p>

<p>Different people will different opinions. I personally  enjoy the JavaScript/HTMl world more than I do C#/XAML. You don&#39;t and that&#39;s fine, the point I was making is that in our industry change is inevitable. Whether you like the outcome or not, technology will change and 5, 10 , 15 years from now we&#39;ll all be coding in something different. So OP needs to cultivate this mentality of learning and adapting instead of just being annoyed that the world is changing.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t/don&#39;t need to set a length. You&#39;re assigning <code>delta</code> to <code>rules</code>, so they will both refer to the same array/object. Because they refer to the same array/object, <code>rules</code> has the same length as <code>delta</code>. </p>

<p>If you wanted a new or differently-size array. You would have to create a <code>new String[theLength]</code>, and manually copy the items to the new array using a loop or System.arraycopy(). </p>

<li><p>Double the raw estimate.  Perhaps this isn&#39;t the same at all companies but we are a small team who&#39;s priorities get shifted around a lot.  I can&#39;t expect to be able to allocate 100% of my available man hours to one project.  This is beyond my control so I double the estimate but even if this wasn&#39;t the case you should add some contingency to estimates.</p></li>

<pre><code>char *a = &quot;abc&quot;; // &quot;abc&quot; and terminating null character are placed in read only memory by compiler
char *s = malloc(sizeof(char) * 4); // Space for 4 characters is made on the heap that s now points to
strncpy(s, a, 4); // the string abc is copied from read only memory onto the heap, where it can be modified.

s[1] = &#39;B&#39;; // this would make the B in the string s capital

<p>Ok, so the issue is purely recognizing a label, and not indicating a collision with it?</p>

<p>Looking at the online documentation, it looks like there&#39;s no direct way to detect if an object is a label, or what it is. However, you do have a <code>getLabel()</code> function.</p>

<p>So what you can do is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check if you have an object (i.e not null)</li>
<li>Then get the label for the object, and check if the label is empty or not. </li>

<p>Aside from the fact that your professor didn&#39;t want you to use array indexing, your code is still wrong because he wants a pointer to the first occurrence of ch, you are returning an index</p>

<p>The nice thing about pointers is that they &#39;know&#39; what they are.  So say you have</p>

<pre><code>char *ptr
ptr++ 
</code></pre>

<p>ptr++ will increment the pointer by sizeof(char).  Ditto for an integer.  This way, you can iterate over the characters of the string without using an integer to keep track of your index.  </p>

<p>your code&#39;s skeleton is &quot;correct&quot; in that you need to loop over the contents of the string to find equivalence, but the way you do it is wrong.  If you use a pointer, and increment it accordingly, you will find your solution.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Neither. In how they use it. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I see, a pointer-pointer/double-pointer instead of a normal pointer, that makes sense. The only problem I can see, which is an aesthetic point of view, is that having to use the AddressOf operator would get cumbersome for large amounts of function calls. I&#39;m building this for a string_utils library I&#39;m working on (so I never, ever have to deal with this ever again), and, for instance, if I have a concat_all variadic function, say, parsing about 10 - 15 different strings at once, adding that extra &#39;&amp;&#39; would get rather cumbersome.</p>

<p>However, I must say, however, that if this is the only solution, I&#39;d gladly take it, but is there a way... maybe generically pass the string as either a char *<em>, or char * (For instance, a void *, where flags determine whether or not the void * is converted to a char * or a char *</em>)? </p>

So tokenizing an input and querying on specific parts may work, but then you have to start throwing away filler words like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;a&quot; etc. Otherwise your search is heavily skewed.</p>

<p>I worked on a site where the search implementation was basically that and it was broken. Another search issue is nearby searches for example if I have a music database I want to be able to search for the rapper jayz by &quot;jay z&quot; jay-z&quot; &quot;Jay Zee&quot; &quot;J Z&quot;</p>

   // returns the pointer has been changed.

<p>Remember it&#39;s always easier to ask for 40 million when the client thinks you are at 95% than it is to ask for 50k at 5%, even if they both solve the same problem.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes.  You figure out a super simple version of what the client wants that actually delivers some value and they would actually use that can be built in about 2 weeks.  Getting good at knowing what slice to make to deliver value early is the really tricky part.  Anyhow, they know what they are getting in 2 weeks and they know what they are paying for it.  No surprises.  Ship it.  Get paid.  Do a new 2 week cycle.  Each iteration the customer learns something about the software they are imagining they didn&#39;t know before and change course.  This way you end up with what they need not what they asked for on day one.</p>

<p>Points to remember: don&#39;t promise what you don&#39;t know (like projects beyond a 2 week horizon or what the customer is going to want once they start using it) and don&#39;t make the customer pay for something that isn&#39;t valuable to them (non functional software that&#39;s part of grand vision is not valuable).</p>

<p>This philosophy in software is usually called &quot;agile&quot; and was developed because of many decades of &quot;waterfall design&quot; which produced countless projects where millions of dollars were spent and nothing of value was ever delivered.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Honestly learning web technologies is not all that bad. Don&#39;t get me wrong HTML/CSS/Javascript use to take a long time to do simple things but then frameworks were invented and then came ASP.NET. I suggest <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/training-courses/introduction-to-asp-net-mvc">starting</a> here with an introduction to mvc. Then after that check out </p>

</ul>

<p>With asp.net a lot of html and css is done for you. I do believe any asp.net project automatically uses a html/css framework called bootstrap which is explained in the intro to mvc on the microsoft virtual academy website</p>

<p>For more detailed and hands on work with html/css/javascript you can also try these.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">HTML/CSS</a> &lt; for first time intro to web this might be a good place to start instead of the html5 microsoft videos but html/css is very simple to pick up and shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to understand if you can program in C# html/css should be a breeze.</li>

</div><div class="md"><p>What:
Lambdas are a short-hand way of writing anonymous functions.</p>

<p>Why:
<a href="http://www.dotnetperls.com/lambda">I think this C# article covers it better</a> but having a shorthand for an anonymous function is often very useful.</p>

<p>So the first example they give is</p>

<pre><code>int oddIndex = elements.FindIndex(x =&gt; x % 2 != 0)
</code></pre>

<p>Lambda expressions often let you avoid writing code that would otherwise take multiple lines and nested loops, whilst also letting you express your idea more visibly. So for a developer it&#39;s win/win.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re worried about not knowing what they are and not knowing why you&#39;d care, that&#39;s understandable, there&#39;s nothing you can do with a lambda expression that can&#39;t be done otherwise. But they can provide a powerful way of making code shorter, more readable, and more robust. They&#39;re sexiest in C# along with LINQ (&quot;why can&#39;t we query lists like we do DBs) but have uses in other places.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, I agree too! That&#39;s why I wanted to make it clear that I was asking a different question: my question was &#39;<em>given</em> that I&#39;ve got to learn both, which would be best to learn?&#39;.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I know that many people wrongly think that they should learn C before learning C++, and that doing so is both unnecessary and runs the risk of leading to bad C++ practices.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is only true if you don&#39;t recognize that C and C++ are different programming language. One approaches things different in C and in C++. It is true code written in C can compile in C++ with usually only very minor changes, but that code you get would probably never be the code you&#39;d write if you were solving the problem in C++.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Given that I&#39;ll need to learn both, would you recommend learning C first, and then moving onto C++? Or should I start with C++?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I always recommend that people learn C before learning C++. The reason is because the underlying difficulty of learning these languages as opposed to other language is that it requires you have an understanding of how many things work on a process or system level. You have to understand what memory is, you have to understand how I/O is modeled in C/C++ and implemented, you have to understand what happens during a function call and how that relates to memory. </p>

<p>These are problems you will encounter in both C and C++, but in C they will be much more transparent, and in C++ I believe they are much more obscure. For example, a problem like object slicing makes a lot more sense in C++ if you understand the underlying C memory model. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you! </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for your help! I think you&#39;re exactly right, since they&#39;re not using C++11. It&#39;s quite a legacy code base (to say the least... the project existed before the modern computer did!).

<p>Sad, but true.</p>

<p>Hopefully in a couple of years from now there&#39;s going to be a usable web platform. There are some efforts on that, such as TypeScript, which prevents you from suffering javascript&#39;s retardedness, but it only goes so far. There&#39;s also lots of javascript frameworks that try to imitate the ability to do MVVM with HTML, but they all fail to achieve the same level of ease you get with XAML, because HTML is retarded and was never intended to create real applications, only stupid static &quot;documents&quot;.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>First you need to define what you mean by programming.

</div><div class="md"><p>The URL doesn&#39;t mean anything until the server receiving it processes it, since it&#39;s just a string.

Then the function is responsible for returning the requested page, which it may generate on the fly.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Your detectCollision function is broken in a number of ways.</p>

<p>You act like getGObjectAt won&#39;t get back the ball. Consider:</p>

<pre><code>double x = getX(ball);
double y = getY(ball);
</code></pre>

<p>Do you agree that the ball object is located at x,y? Ok.</p>

<pre><code>object = getGObjectAt(window, x, y);
</code></pre>

<p>So you are getting the top-most object located at x,y , right?</p>

<pre><code>if (object != NULL)
</code></pre>

<p>We just said the ball is located at x,y . In what situation is the ball located at x,y , but getGObjectAt tells you there is no object at x,y?</p>

<hr/>

<p>Another issue: </p>

<pre><code>// check for collision at ball&#39;s top-left corner
// check for collision at ball&#39;s top-right corner
// check for collision at ball&#39;s bottom-left corner
// check for collision at ball&#39;s bottom-right corner
</code></pre>

<p>What if the object doesn&#39;t collide at the corners? Consider a square smaller than the ball is located within the bounds of the ball. It doesn&#39;t collide at any corner, but there&#39;s an obvious collision, since the ball completely overlaps the square.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Another issue (2):</p>

<p>You don&#39;t check for the ball going out of bounds of the window. Does collision only mean with other objects, or do you also want to consider colliding with the edges of the window?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well if you need to learn both you need to learn both. Just grab some books and get going, you&#39;re a smart guy it doesn&#39;t matter whether you start with one or the other or both. What does matter is which part of C++ to focus on. If your job uses both C and C++ there might be a reason that reflects a particular usage of C++. In that case the usual advice of learning modern C++ and avoiding &quot;C with classes&quot; (the &quot;bad practices&quot; you have heard about which may or may not actually be bad) might not apply. It would help if you could tell us any details at all about the job, like which version of C++ they use, if they&#39;re used for separate projects or mixed within the same project, etc.</p>

<p>So does the server actually send all of the requests to a single file, which parses that code out of the URL and then based on that returns the corresponding page?</p>

<p>So essentially, the directory structure becomes irrelevant and we can&#39;t think of it in terms of having /user/login/index.html in order to get <a href="https://jsfiddle.net/user/login/">https://jsfiddle.net/user/login/</a>, all of that has to be manually routed?</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>This is a very frequently asked question and therefore kinda despised here. (Look at FAQ/Wiki)</p>

<p>The choice of language does not depend on a problem alone. Most programming languages are turing-complete. That means they are equally powerful.</p>

<p>However some programming languages have benefits when used in speicific contexts/environments. Some have a simpler syntax. Some have a highly optimized implementation (runtime, compilers etc.).</p>

<p>You should also learn how a computer may solve a problem. You can&#39;t just say:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I would like a program where I can enter Bob 100 tickets Jill 50 tickets and then click &quot;Draw Winner!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is how <em>clients</em> talk. But if you were a client, you&#39;d have to pay.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a UX guy, but I participate in the estimating for some of the projects we sell. We have found it advantageous for each discipline to be represented in the estimating process, so we get separate estimates from UX, visual design, front end developers, and back end developers. Then we apply a formula to calculate PM hours, QA hours, and server setup based on complexity of the project. </p>

<p>Each department typically starts with a base number of hours (we start with a product and then customize it per customer). Then they look at every change or enhancement and estimate that change. Then we add up all the base hours and all the changes and we have our estimate. </p>

<p>As far as how they estimate each change, they typically compare it to similar projects we have done in the past, or just guess based on experience. When everything is broken out into smaller chunks, though, it&#39;s much easier to think through how you would implement each piece, so the estimates can be more specific. This specificity really improves the accuracy in my experience. </p>

<p>Also, some people tend to estimate high or low. My boss adds 10% to everything I estimate because I&#39;m optimistic and fast. </p>

<p>Once we have a good estimate, the salesperson goes and fucks it all up and sells it to the customer for a number pulled out of their ass. When we do a retrospective on over budget projects, it&#39;s almost always because the salesperson slashes our budget to get the sale closed. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Well I&#39;d say most of the things you talk about I learned from experience, never really did see a good source on that. But what you&#39;re asking about is really a two part question. Since I&#39;m most familiar with Linux, my answer is mostly for linux specifically, but the same applies to other OS&#39;s, though the exact commands/terms are a bit different.</p>

<ol>
<li>Build errors, compiler problems, dependencies when compiling.</li>
<li>Linking problems, both runtime and buildtime</li>
</ol>

<p>For #1, you&#39;ll get build problems from changes in compilers, toolchains, etc. Not everything is implemented the same in all compilers, and there is a LOT of compiler specific variables, and the program may be almost entirely tested with one compiler, using something different than tested, even if it has the option and claims to support it may not work. There are compiler specific things out there (often required to implement things that C says is undefined, but required to be defined as part of some form of an API). For type of issues you either switch to what&#39;s recommended or go ahead and find the unsupported thing and fix it, depending on what&#39;s more feasible. Also don&#39;t forget about #ifdef&#39;s very often different code paths are built in different configuration, it&#39;s not fool proof, your configuration might not be handled. It&#39;s important to check the source, sometimes the option your configuration needs is in the source, but the #ifdef doesn&#39;t build it, modify the #ifdef or change the compiler flags (by defining something the ifdef depends on) to make it build.</p>

<p>Then you have dependencies, if you&#39;re lucky the build process will tell you what&#39;s missing, if you&#39;re unlucky you&#39;ll get errors about missing headers or undefined functions/constants/etc. In that case, I usually just search the source for that, and google the missing thing, mostly to figure out what provides that, and when it changed (what version), usually these errors are either a missing dependency or you&#39;re using the wrong version of that dependency, so either install the right version of the dependency or fix the code to work with the version you want. Sometimes this is just about helping the compiler find the headers, you might just need to search your computer for the header, and tell the compiler to look in there (using -I/path/to/dir for gcc)</p>

<p>For #2, you&#39;ll see linking errors, during build time these will be the symbols your code referenced (since it found a header for it) but didn&#39;t find the associated library. Since it got that far, you probably forgot to tell the compiler to link against the library (-lmyLib for gcc) or forgot to tell the compiler where to find the library (-L/path/to/dir for gcc). Sometimes, if you have multiple versions of a lib, you might be just linking against the wrong library, or the library you are linking against is putting the symbol in a different code, you can google the symbol and find out, I also like just running <code>objdump -T</code> on all my .so files and grepping the output looking for the symbol. If you find it you can add it to your compiler flags.</p>

<p>For runtime issues, you&#39;ll get either undefined symbols or not found errors, ldd can be used to help figure out what libraries it&#39;s looking for that it can&#39;t find. On linux you can also set the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to tell the runtime linker where to look, and you can set LD_PRELOAD to force the runtime linker to load some library (even if there is a version mismatch).</p>

<p>For a more general overview, learn how your build system works, learn how your compiler works, learn how your linker works, learn how code interfaces with the OS, documentation and google is your friend! And don&#39;t forget man pages and don&#39;t be afraid to modify the code of some application. Also I kinda glossed over it, but from time to time you find OS differences (especially that when porting), if you&#39;re porting, most of the work is just rewriting code, specifically in areas where the OS APIs are OS specific. For example with windows games getting ported to OSX or Linux, the biggest issue is that windows prefers DirectX and *NIX systems only have OpenGL, either rewrite all DirectX calls to OpenGL or use some library to help you (mono is a very good one for this, it provides an interface). Not much else to do there but find out what&#39;s different between OS&#39;s and implement the code for the different OS.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Problem I&#39;m having is with the function all the way at the bottom detectCollision(). I&#39;m thinking that you can compare what type of GObject object is with  something like</p>

<pre><code>GObject object;

object = getGObjectAt(window, x, y);

if(object == GLabel)
{
    return null;
}
</code></pre>

<p>unfortunately this doesn&#39;t work.</p>

<p>As for the expected behavior the GObject ball is supposed to move until it hits any GObject. This is fine except the ball hits the object GLabel label. I guess this means that GLabel is an object but I don&#39;t know what to do to avoid a collision with this label. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>that is surprising to me because programming is not easy and not a common skill</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>We aren&#39;t the support forum for that particular course. You can&#39;t vaguely refer to some course and expect any help. If you want help, you need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>Fully describe your immediate issue.</li>
<li>Show code.</li>
<li>Describe expected behavior or observations.</li>
<li>Copy paste or show exact observed behaviors.</li>
</ol>

<p>Anything else, and no one will even know what you are talking about.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Umm. I asking what programming language I have to learn to make a program. I feel this is very on topic..</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve moved on constantly. I&#39;ve been coding 5 years from writing my first line of Python now and still don&#39;t feel good enough, so I figured if I can&#39;t be good, I can at least be versatile.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not a programming question and off topic for this subreddit.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So when a client asks you for a project you start delivering small batches and keep iterating?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You know, I think I&#39;ve only ever used recursion once in a project,  although I could be mistaken.  I guess though it&#39;s uses could depend on what you program. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Programmers as a whole are really bad at estimating the amount of time it will take to complete a project. There are so many hidden circumstances that there is generally no way you can foresee them. What most of the teams at my company do is have 2 weeks sprints using agile/scrum. They&#39;ve worked with each other on similar features for a long time, so they hold meetings before each spring and present proposed features and everyone will estimate approximately how much time they think it&#39;ll take someone to implement and whoever has enough of their allotted hours will take it if they think they can do it in time. </p>

<p>TL;DR: You won&#39;t know until you&#39;ve done many similarly sized projects, and even then it&#39;ll only give you a reasonable guess.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Came to the realisation recently that 95% of it is simply naming things logically. </p>

<p>With everything having the correct name, the architecture fits and all things make sense. A single variable with the wrong name, with the wrong concept attached, can throw the whole thing into verbose spaghetti code. Spotting that inconsistency early and defining it clearly, solves many problems before they happen.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You don&#39;t need to pick up languages to impress someone. If you&#39;re really interested in a company and they have a required skills or tools they use section that mentions a language, then it&#39;d be a good idea to learn it. However, in the interview, they are more likely to want to see your process of logically reasoning out and solving a problem under pressure in a sufficient amount of time. Even if you can&#39;t solve it, they want to see that you are going about it the right way, and some may even give you something intentionally hard so that you ask them questions, it shows a good awareness or orientation that even if you don&#39;t know the answer to the problem, you know where to start looking.</p>

<p>Also you&#39;ll never know until you try it. So I say, pick a language and stick with it, then learn as much about general programming as you can using that language. Data structures, recursion, user interaction, systems programming, web application development, whatever. Each language is a tool and syntax really doesn&#39;t mean much, it can always be learned. They&#39;re looking for the people who can make informed decisions about their tools. I started my job not knowing C# but since I had strong object-oriented skills and generally good practices internalized, I had no problem picking it up and completing a fairly large-sized project for my company as a summer intern.</p>

<p>TL;DR: Language doesn&#39;t matter as much as method and general knowledge. You won&#39;t gain interview experience unless you interview, force yourself to go to some, even if you don&#39;t think you want to work at that company. Every opportunity is a good experience and should be taken.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That makes sense I suppose. I really appreciate your help! I&#39;m trying the other solution first just out of pure laziness (it seems easier), but thanks for you input!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thank you! Wow. I&#39;m a fool.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ohh.. I get it.  That&#39;s a tradeoff.  His version does not as he uses O(k)  space. Mine will also not,  if I use O(n)  space,  similarly quick select will also not on using O(n)  space.  But yes,  my method has more space complexity,  better time time complexity.  It is a tradeoff.  I see your point. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So I have been inspecting this:</p>

<p>stringExample.substring(0,stringExample.indexOf(&quot;,&quot;)).length()</p>

<p>and it&#39;s been showing out of bounds error.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t think of inspecting:</p>

<p>stringExample.indexOf(&quot;,&quot;)</p>

<p>THAT returns the -1! This solution seems like the least amount of work. I&#39;m trying this first.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> Solved! This worked really well! Or at least I&#39;ll find out how well when the guy who is training me looks at it on Monday. Thanks again!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for clearing that up! Always good to know more</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Resolving compilation and linker errors is hardly &quot;lower level&quot;; it&#39;s essential in using any compiled language. I have an intro to using the GCC command line on my blog, starting <a href="http://latedev.wordpress.com/2011/07/08/the-gcc-command-line-part-1/">here</a>, and there are many other internet resources on the subject.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can use substring after you&#39;ve found the end.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>True. The hardest part for me initially wasn&#39;t the syntax, that comes over time. It was things like faulty logic, recursion errors, &quot;what the hell is a constructor and how is it different from a method,&quot; and things like that. Particularly logic surrounding if/else statement order, ordering code in something interpreted, like Python, and troubleshooting true/false logic, particularly withing if/else or case statements.</p>

<p>Oh, and for crying out loud, the concept of private variables and things like getters and setters completely eluded me until maybe two or three months ago, and I&#39;ve been learning on my own now for 10 or 11 months.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Certain classes / schools will always be more coding focused, and others will be more focused on theory. They&#39;re both equally important.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Isn&#39;t &quot;random until condition&quot; bad? Wouldn&#39;t that lead to worse and worse performance as the system grew and potentially an infinite loop? (Returning the same invalid id every time is random)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If there&#39;s no comma, then <code>String.indexOf(&#39;,&#39;)</code> will return <code>-1</code>. You need to check if that index is -1, and if it is, use the length of the string as the &quot;end index&quot;. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Cool. Hope you can find buy-in for the solution, it sounds interesting.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>By feedback, do you mean the test case results?</p>

<p>Some college professors have implemented their own home-grown script, usually in Bash, to do this for them. We take it a step further and also translate all the cryptic error and warning messages a program generates so that the students can actually get to a working submission.</p>

<p>A big focus for us is also opening this up (for free) to high school teachers who usually don&#39;t have nearly as strong a background in CS as a college professor does.</p>

<p>Our site is <a href="http://www.gradetrain.com">www.gradetrain.com</a> by the way.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying using a loop to step through each character? Like instead of using substring at all?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>No, you&#39;re exactly right. Running unit tests isn&#39;t that hard, any CS professor worth their salt can write a Bash script that&#39;ll do it for them (and they do). But what about a high school math teacher who is teaching a Java AP prep course, but doesn&#39;t have the background in CS to give good feedback?</p>

<p>GradeTrain doesn&#39;t stop with the unit test feedback though. We also translate the cryptic errors and warnings that a program will generate during compilation or runtime. The end of May we&#39;ll be releasing an online IDE that will help students jump right into coding without messing around with NetBeans or similar.</p>

<p>So many students fail programming courses or drop their CS major because they don&#39;t have a good support system during their first few programming projects. GradeTrain is that support system :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Step through the string, one character at a time, looking for a comma. If you reach either the end of the string or a comma, you know what the first id is.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Coding is the easy part. The problem with most coding curriculum is it focuses too much on coding. It&#39;s similar to teaching someone how to use a bunch of power tools and then handing them a stack of lumber and telling them to build a house. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Planning poker</strong>, also called <strong>Scrum poker</strong>, is a consensus-based technique for estimating, mostly used to estimate effort or relative size of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_stories">development goals</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development">software development</a>. In planning poker, members of the group make estimates by playing numbered cards face-down to the table, instead of speaking them aloud. The cards are revealed, and the estimates are then discussed. By hiding the figures in this way, the group can avoid the cognitive bias of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anchoring">anchoring</a>, where the first number spoken aloud sets a precedent for subsequent estimates.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>So you&#39;re saying I can teach my ten year old brother to be ahead of the pack in like a week?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I always hoped someone out there used T-shirt estimates and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker">planning poker</a>. </p>

<p>Our group doesn&#39;t use them but I thought they looked fun, and practical for developers at different experience levels whose estimates mean drastically different things, especially when switching groups/shops. Those two techniques always seemed like a good impartial estimate to get the ball rolling when that sort of thing is tough. But my group thought they were dumb and the other group I was helping only used them for a few months to integrate some new outsourcers.</p>

<p>My group tends to get a rough idea of the request, then give a rough development estimate that includes a bit of overhead for unexpected setbacks. Then refine from there as details come in and development progresses. I&#39;m not sure how to describe the how of that. I CAN suggest that if there are dependencies on outside groups (outside data, webservices, or even policy or politics will slow things down) you want to up that estimate some more. </p>

<p>We adjust our estimates daily or weekly from there on the scrum or whatever meeting/calls.</p>

<p>I suck at estimates but somehow one of my colleages is spot on with his all the time.
He jokingly adds decimals to his estimates like &quot;18.3 hours&quot; or 42.8% complete.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Instead of using an index, you need to increment the <code>string</code> variable, which is a pointer (i.e. <code>string++</code>) and look at what it points to using the dereference operator i.e. <code>*string</code>. Also, you want to increment the pointer at the end of the loop, not at the beginning (same is true when using an integer index).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I honestly can&#39;t help you with this. I just wanted to make sure one thing was clear: Objective-C is stupidly named. It&#39;s nothing like any other language with &quot;C&quot; in the name. Heck, even C# is more C-like than Objective-C. As such,it&#39;s kinda hard to switch to from the languages you listed (All of which I enjoy using! ) I gave up after a couple weeks of trying to find a decent tutorial. I think you&#39;re better off learning Swift. I wish you luck with your endeavours, however you end up going about it!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Generics have their quirks.</p>

<p>Also the distinction between the primitives <code>int</code> and so on and their object counterparts <code>Integer</code> etc. can be a real pain.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s good to hear. I&#39;m glad too see all these cool educational technologies come out. Maybe one day, when my kids get to high school, they&#39;ll benefit from these technologies.</p>

<p>Programming is becoming, more and more, a life skill. Like using a smartphone, the internet or tapping out text messages really fast. I believe teaching kids who have no desire to enter CS some basic programming skills can only benefit society at large. My 2c.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>What/where is this project?  At my uni homeworks/small projects were graded with scripts, so you never had to wait more than a day for feedback.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Fair enough. I checked out your site, and honestly it looks to function the same way as many MOOCs and &quot;codewars&quot; style sites. The University of Helsinki MOOCs already provide unit test functionality in their assignments. </p>

<p>Do you provide individual, personal feedback, or is it just the unit testing? What makes GradeTrain stand out?</p>

<p>Also, is college feedback really that bad these days? When I was in school we got feedback at least weekly, and often bi-weekly in a three a week class, with one of the three being a lab. That was a decade ago though.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the root cause of a lot of what you&#39;re addressing simply stems from poor teaching, poor learning habits, and greedy universities not providing quality education at a reasonable cost. This could be fixed, but it&#39;s something that&#39;s difficult to correct at the root cause, because it&#39;s simply too large for any one simple solution. I won&#39;t knock the idea behind GradeTrain, it sounds good and unit testing won&#39;t hurt anyone. It&#39;s just a question of what makes it unique and how you&#39;ll convince people to use it. </p>

<p>(Also, looks a lot better now after the edit, your post is much more readable and clear now).</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Like <a href="/u/desrtfx">/u/desrtfx</a> mentioned, primitive arrays (such as <code>int[]</code>) are not compatible with object/generic arrays. The simplest solution would be to use a non-primitive array. Change <code>int[]</code> to <code>Integer[]</code>, and <code>double[]</code> to <code>Double[]</code>, and I think it should work: </p>

<pre><code>Integer[] intArray = {3, 2, 5, 4, 1}; //array for integer values
Double[] floatArray = {2.2, 1.1, 5.5, 4.4, 3.3}; //array for floating-point values

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>What you&#39;re talking about is called localization and Visual Studio already has tools built in for handling this problem. Let me warn you, it&#39;s a pretty huge topic since it covers a lot more than just changing up strings, but that&#39;s definitely one of the components of it.
Start here: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f45fce5x%28v=vs.110%29.aspx%5B1%5D">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/f45fce5x%28v=vs.110%29.aspx[1]</a>
Basically you&#39;re going down the right track, you define resource files which are basically just xml files. In the resource file you identify all of the strings you&#39;re going to need to localize, and then in your application rather than setting the text directly you ask the resource to load the correct value for the users currently selected culture/language. That way your app can respond when the user switches their culture via the operating system, so when your app runs they don&#39;t have to pick a language</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I know you can program it like that. But I am not that experienced a programmer, I just want it to change the strings when I select an Index in a drop down menu.</p>

<p>Also I was kind of thinking of using the same method for the calculations part because while the options are one thing, their values are going to be something else. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m sure that there&#39;s some one-liner somewhere that can fix this, but it&#39;d be pretty easy in C/C++. Open both files, then stream/scanf in each file one line at a time, and then store the values that you want from each. If you don&#39;t have a storage type, define one, and then save it when you&#39;re done.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Members should be able to modify the dev branch without merging or hassle. If they check-in something that doesn&#39;t compile or doesn&#39;t work, revert the change and tell them to test better. If possible have a server that tries to compile automatically after a change is submitted and emails the responsible parties if the build fails. If you are doing unit tests, require all unit tests to be run before checking in a file. Easy way to see if you broke something.</p>

<p>You only need to merge weekly (whatever time period) from your dev to main. Then merge/split from main to release if needed. You should not be trying to merge daily, weekly is about the minimum time between merges I would do.</p>

<p>This method depends on team members being responisble enough to not check-in non-compiling code and having the ability to do basic testing.</p>

<p>Also this is only one option, how you manage the repos highly depends on how stable you want things and how trustworthy the people who have access are.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well like I said, your functionality should be done with JavaScript, styling with CSS, and structure with HTML. The concerns should be completely separate. You&#39;ve got some inline styling and function calls going on. Also, take care to write a valid HTML 5 document (e.g., opening/closing html tags, proper head and body tags. It&#39;s always nice to indent your code too!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The problem is that Generics don&#39;t support <em>primitive</em> data types like <code>int</code>, <code>double</code> which also applies to <em>arrays of primitive</em> types.</p>

<p>They best approach is negotiating the delivered feature set and offering multiple deliveries.  This requires you to get requirements as specific as possible.   The business generally has a delivery date in mind that won&#39;t change for any reason, so rather than pushing for more time you tell them what portion of the delivery you can provide by the target date and then give estimates for completing anything left.     </p>

<p>A lot of estimation comes for experience but it helps to keep track of durations and problems of prior work in order to better estimate future work.</p>

<p>That&#39;s true. Python on Linux seems a lot more natural than in Windows. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s exactly what we discovered when students started using our product. Getting a grade and finding out what test cases you could have done better on is great, but they benefited more from exactly the feedback you&#39;re talking about.</p>

<p>GradeTrain currently not only offers test case feedback, but also takes the compiler/runtime errors and warnings and translates them into something that someone who has never written code before can understand. We also give them style feedback to help them get those bonus points for cleanest code in the class :)</p>

<p>What do you feel is the <em>actual</em> problem? Because you didn&#39;t really say, aside from pointing out the obvious &quot;once you start to get left behind in a class, it becomes easier and easier to fall more and more behind,&quot; which is the same for <em>any</em> college course or curriculum, not an inherent issue with CS.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Of course I also am here to propose a solution, which we at GradeTrain have built. If anyone out there is interested, I would love feedback on if this element of my proposal makes sense.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So basically you&#39;re advertising GradeTrain? Because you didn&#39;t specify anything about the &quot;proposed solution&quot; in your post. This feels like clickbait without the click.</p>

<p>As for your issues with the way CS education goes... Well, it&#39;s the nature of things. You can&#39;t slow down a course in which there are only a static 12 or 16 weeks to work with simply because some of the students in the course can&#39;t keep up. Otherwise <em>every</em> student will fall behind in the curriculum and be unprepared for their next semester. Better for <em>some</em> students to have to repeat the course than for <em>all of them</em> to do so. </p>

<p>A better solution is for students to prepare in advance for curriculae by studying in the off season (between semesters) or doing self study, as there are many more self taught developers than college educated ones. Much like any topic, you&#39;re not going to get all you need for programming and development in class. The onus is on the individual here, though granted, from my experience in the past, the teaching environment <em>can</em> probably be improved. It really depends on the experience level of the teacher and their ability to convey concepts in an understandable fashion.</p>

<p>Lastly, I know your enter key isn&#39;t broken thanks to your first line. Do you even paragraph?</p>

<p>Cool idea. Too bad I didn&#39;t think of it first; damnit. Good luck to you guys.</p>

<p>One thing I notice is that quite a few students don&#39;t struggle with correcting their output, but rather  getting their programs to run at all. While building a static analyzer may be outside your scope, parsing and displaying compile-time errors in a more human-readable format (even just suggesting the line number, which gcc does a poor job at for the uninitiated) might be a good thing.</p>

<p>Seriously, though, from my experience, Flask is like Django-lite, and a lot of what you&#39;ll learn implementing simple Flask apps can transfer directly to making simple Django apps.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I know both. Though there are huge underlying differences, they are very similar codewise. Especially to a beginner programmer. The main difference codewise is single inheritance, no explicit pointers and abstract/interface classes instead of virtual.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yes, I&#39;m aware of that. I&#39;m not sure if you&#39;re disagreeing with me or not. Of course static members can be accessed, if their access modifiers allow it. I never said they couldn&#39;t. I did say that they could not be <strong>dynamically</strong> accessed, which is what OP is asking about. </p>

<p>OP is asking how to dynamically access a static variable, either in a base class or a subclass. OP said that he or she will not know the specific enclosing class until run-time, so  the<code>ClassName.member</code> syntax will not work. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You can do a simple brute force search. That will work for smaller databases and few users.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why <em>static variables</em> are to be prepended with the <em>declaring class</em> as I have outlined in my previous comment to OP.</p>

<p>It is perfectly possible and fairly standard to access static members.</p>

<p>Just think about the <em>constants</em> in the <em>Math</em> package:</p>

<p><code>Math.E</code> or <code>Math.PI</code> they are both just <code>public static final</code>variables, nothing more, nothing less.</p>

<p>Perhaps you could make an instance method like &quot;getVarConstant()&quot; and override it in your subclasses. But this isn&#39;t a very good solution either. </p>

<p>If you could explain why you&#39;re trying to do this, then we might be able to offer a better OO design. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Could someone explain the downvotes? If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;d like to know why. I realize that saying there&#39;s &quot;no way&quot; might be overstating it a bit (because I did provide a solution); but I&#39;m pretty sure that OP will need something other than a simple &quot;ClassName.variable&quot; expression (which seems to be the top answer), as OP clearly stated and emphasized that he will not know which class&#39;s static variable he needs to access until run-time. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Brilliant! :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hey, I just finished up Data Structures last semester and did pretty well. It can be tough, but I had an excellent professor.</p>

<p>Sorting was a really big part of our curriculum. Knowing all the types of sorts, their Big O, which work better with sorted or unsorted arrays, etc. is all really useful and practical. It took me a long time to wrap my head around how they work functionally, even though I had the principles pretty much down. Try iterating them on paper with a sample array, then implementing that in Java or your preferred language. <a href="http://panthema.net/2013/sound-of-sorting/#video">The Sound of Sorting</a> is a really cool resource for visualizing sorting.</p>

<p>Linked Lists, Array Lists and Arrays were all crucial for exams in that class. Know their benefits and drawbacks, and have at least a rudimentary idea of their structure, i.e. be able to draw a picture if you need to. When is one better than another? Etc.</p>

<p>Binary trees and traversal were really easy for me, and actually very interesting and useful. I feel like in general that class got significantly easier after the 50% mark. The Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">Tree Traversal</a> has a wonderful method for pre-order, in-order and post-order traversals. My professor wasn&#39;t super pleased when I demonstrated that one in class cause he viewed it as a kind of cop out (I guess), but it works really well. Just pay attention to the placement of the dots. </p>

<p>I think, like most other classes, if you go to class every day and really pay attention to the lecture, you will be fine. I barely cracked the book. That said, there was a lot of application, so don&#39;t be afraid to bust out NetBeans and test things out. </p>

<p>Best of luck!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Also you could try lrth I know he was pretty good for helping me to learn Python fhttp://learnrubythehardway.org</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>These are some of the best C# tutorials that exist.  You may be tempted to skip the early ones, don&#39;t.  He explains things like no one else I&#39;ve seen.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>In general, calling static variables is done by prepending the <em>Class</em> in which the static variable is defined.</p>

<p>Static variables <em>do not belong</em> to any <em>instance</em> of a class (i.e. any <em>object</em>), they belong to the <em>class itself</em>.</p>

<p>So, the <em>proper</em> calls for your static variables would be:</p>

<pre><code>ClassBase.var
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>ClassDerived.var
</code></pre>

<p>Just like you call the <em>static methods</em> of the <em>Math</em> class:</p>

<pre><code>Math.sqrt()
Math.random()
Math.sin()
</code></pre>

<p>etc.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><code>if (write stuff and runs) { good enough }</code></p>

<p>Once you have a few languages under your belt, learning another is a non-event.</p>

<p>Now becoming a good programmer in general, that&#39;s another story.</p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>puts *1..10 
</code></pre>

<p>Should work too I think</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I know but I think having some sort of an idea about those things is always good.</p>

<p>I have worked with people who had no idea of how mobile/web worked and it came out quite clearly when talking. </p>

<p>I think that knowing a bit of those &#39;not-so-useful&#39; subjects can help a lot in certain situations, especially when understanding the bigger picture (architecture) is important.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As a bonus, the partition process in that algorithm moves the small values to the front, so the output step is only O(k).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Good point! I was thinking of taking another course to either supplement or reinforce my foundation, but now I&#39;m thinking why not just give it a shot and build an app. </p>

<p>But I was seriously considering a real online bootcamp, something like Tealeaf or Firehose- which will put me in front of a mentor. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmm, stable was the wrong term, I should get a time out on complaining about sloppy analysis. What I was trying to say was that his version doesn&#39;t modify the input, yours (and the quickselect version) does.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You mean, on a resume? </p>

<ul>
<li>Indicate you&#39;re looking for an internship.</li>
<li>Indicate which year you expect to graduate and/or what year you are (first year, second year, or the traditional freshman, sophomore, etc)</li>
<li>If you list classes, provide the names of the classes, don&#39;t say, for example, CS111, which means nothing to readers.</li>
<li>If you did a fairly complex project (more than a hundred lines), briefly describe project (wrote a Connect-Four game in Java using Eclipse IDE with binary tree data structures).</li>
<li>You can put a GPA if it&#39;s above about 3.2 (or major GPA, if it&#39;s higher and you have some idea how to compute).</li>
<li>Indicate any jobs where you might have to lead people even if it&#39;s non-technical (though it helps if it&#39;s technical).</li>
</ul>

<p>Write a cover letter showing interest/enthusiasm, and what you feel you bring to the table.  Some view enthusiasm as important as technical skill.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s Google&#39;s advice on what to do as an undergrad: <a href="https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html">https://www.google.com/about/careers/students/guide-to-technical-development.html</a></p>

<p>Basically, the advice many are giving is to work on a project, put it on github (hopefully, get some advice about your project first before doing that).</p>

<p>Keep in mind that long-term, you need to think of a way of distinguishing yourself from others.</p>

<p>I would only put grades on those courses that you did well in, though be prepared to answer questions about the other courses.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>But I don&#39;t know how sed can change an entire column of values</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Practice will fix that :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>first backup everything to some other storage.</p>

<p>you can try to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15704945/how-to-revert-the-file-in-cvs">revert</a> the changed files on the development machine. Then set up a new cvs server and checkin everything from those reverted files. you will never be able to go back of course but it should at least mimic most of the functionality before you lost the real server.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;d store the relevant information (in this case the code) in a database, with a key field (I call it a slug)
Then, when a request comes in, you fetch the relevant data based on this slug.</p>

<p>To generate the slug, I usually randomly generate html safe base 64 strings until </p>

<pre><code>SELECT COUNT(*) data_table WHERE slug = &#39;[insert slug here]&#39; 
</code></pre>

<p>returns 0</p>

<p>Edit: make sure you add the slug column as an index so you aren&#39;t doing a full table scan.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Since this is <a href="/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a> why not make a bot that posts exactly this every x time?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well you mentioned a change, so I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s one change, you do know what you want to change right?</p>

<p>Anyways, my process still stands, you read it in, make the changes, and write it out again. sed will do that for you if you know what you&#39;re changing to begin with. Otherwise something like awk, or some real programming language if you need to do something more complicated than just search and replace.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Absorbing less with an ebook vs a real book... really isn&#39;t THAT far from absorbing less with an online tutorial vs a new copy of C# for Dummies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It definitely is IMO.  The docs, tutorials, language specs, etc. that I find online are quite different from the books I&#39;ve seen, and they are all available immediately - no need to buy so many books to get the same info, plus they are searchable.  Putting a book on an e-reader device doesn&#39;t convert it into the same thing as all the online material that&#39;s available.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why is there only one comment in this?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Also put on any blogs/magazines and mention this subreddit. When I was applying for mine I was asked about all sorts of sites and reading I was into for programming at my interview. I&#39;d also suggest you head over to Stack Overflow, that&#39;s something else you can put on it.</p>

<p>Best thing you can do is put any code you have on something like Github. Cobble a website together (doesn&#39;t need to be fancy, even a single static html) and links to your github, stack accounts. Adding these can improve your CV greatly.</p>

<p>But just get invovled in code. Start projects and put then online. Don&#39;t worry what your code looks like or how it runs, we all start somewhere. A project, more so open source, is worth x2000 more than 100 classes. Altho, the classes help too. </p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>in C you don&#39;t need to do the == flag part because any non-0 number evaluates to true, and &amp; by the nature of the mask the result will be 0 unless the mask bit is set</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not normally, but it can be useful</p>

<p>If you define your flags like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define READ (1 &lt;&lt; 0)
#define WRITE (1 &lt;&lt; 1)
#define EXECUTE (1 &lt;&lt; 2)
#define READWRITE (READ | WRITE)
</code></pre>

<p>Then in your code, you can check for the READWRITE condition with one operation, but you need to use the == flag for a multi-bit flag like that to work. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define SELECTED(parameter, flag)(((parameter) &amp; (flag)) == (flag))
if (SELECTED(var, READWRITE)){
    //readwrite
}
if (SELECTED(var, READ | EXECUTE)){
    //read and execute
}
if (SELECTED(var, WRITE)){
    //write
}
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Oh god this is a terrible question. It makes me feel super self-conscious. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Then find more tutorials.  It&#39;s not like it&#39;s difficult to type things into Google.</p>

<p>edit: And it&#39;s not like there aren&#39;t a shitload of c tutorials out there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sure, books have their place, but there&#39;s for better and far different sources on the internet than just SO.  And there are books that were published that are now generally viewed as terrible.  So yeah, I&#39;ll stick with the main tutorials on the main site of a given language.  I think those people know what they are talking about.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Follow the MSDN tutorials. They are pretty good for basic programs you can easily add features too and learn from. MSDN is the best site C# I think.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks. I clearly suck at Google.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s powerful, but the exchange for speed isn&#39;t worth it. We validate several million elements, and it is considerably slower. Power doesn&#39;t matter when you don&#39;t need it, and it ties you down to page structure when you don&#39;t need to. When it doesn&#39;t tie you down to page structure, that means that the css selectors are very simple, and much easier to read.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think if you are good enough to solve random problems via pseudocode, it is a good sign you are ready to be a programmer. 15% of coding is the language.. 85% is your brain&#39;s ability to solve problems in a step-by-step manner.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/689512/why-is-null-not-allowed-for-datetime-in-c">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/689512/why-is-null-not-allowed-for-datetime-in-c</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I agree with the cucumber.  Assembly also is much more intuitive (I think) once you understand digital hardware.  Mano&#39;s <em>Digital Design</em> is a good intro into this level of understanding.  Perhaps you&#39;d even enjoy digital hardware design more than coding.  However if you choose to go the software route stick with C before trying to program down to the bare metal.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>one thing my professor always tells is to learn the terms and be able to relay them to potential employers in a professional manner aside from the coding</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I am not sure if that is right or not. In his version we are building a heap,  and later we output the heap.  How will this be stable.  Heap will not maintain stability. By stable I assume you mean output elements as they occur in the array.  Assume array is 1 2 3 4 and I say k is 4,  you build a heap and start outputting.  The very first element you output will be 4 breaking the stability. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In my experience, Django was pretty hard to learn. I know some python and some basic Django stuff, but a lot of Django &#39;apps&#39; have either horrible documentation or are really outdated.</p>

<p>I felt like I was spending more time playing system admin than actual coding. But then again I was working on a PC and not a Mac/Linux (which supposedly are better for Django).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve always liked it, yea, going many levels deep is probably bad practice, but I&#39;ve always found it great for error handling, in PHP at least, you can use it like you use try/catch in java. That is when you have nested loops, you can always break out of the whole loop, not just the inner loop, and I often find myself wanting it (for example, things like read() can return the error EAGAIN, meaning your read() will always be in a loop, but if it returns a real error I want to break out of reading the file, not just the loop I&#39;m in.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>But you wouldn&#39;t reassign the array variable? If you want to use a different array, you&#39;d change myTableView.dataSource to another object which had a different array, right?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think there&#39;s a lot of things in here that a lot of programmers won&#39;t ever need to learn and really have nothing to do with anything they&#39;ll ever need.</p>

<p>Web Design, Mobile Programming, Hacking, and Linux IMO are all things that are not necessary to every programmer.</p>

<p>Web and Mobile obviously don&#39;t need to be even considered by lots of enterprise programmers or backend ones.</p>

<p>Hacking isn&#39;t necessary at all and IMO it is sort of redundant to security. You become a good hacker by knowing the ins and outs of the security of a particular language or stack.</p>

<p>Linux too doesn&#39;t seem too useful for some subsets of programming..</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Your version is not stable, <a href="/u/Tangential_Diversion">/u/Tangential_Diversion</a>&#39;s original is. Not bringing that into the analysis is just sloppy. (I&#39;m not sure but I suspect the nlgk version is optimal for a stable algorithm.)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>THANK YOU for asking that question OP. And - not that anybody will read this, but - THANKS everybody for the many great comments.</p>

<p>This question came exactly at the right time for me. Cheers, OP.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>But this file has almost 1000 lines, so it would be tedious to make the changes manually</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is pretty awesome. Thank you very much! Bookmarked and will have a good look over tomorrow once the few beers I&#39;ve had wear off... Just got through the 3rd week of the course and it got to CTR and CBC modes. Got a little further in the Stanford one but that was a few years ago... I&#39;ll use this along with Al Seiberts book from inventwithpython which is pretty fun to work through. I got a lot of catching up to do in the math dept before I can work through the Modern Day Cryptography book (and the Maryland course on coursera) I got since it&#39;s full of theorems and proofs that I can&#39;t quite follow yet. I just want to get myself back into the habit of coding because I&#39;m being pulled in all directions in work...</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks again. Very much appreciated :-)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Start working on some projects. The projects get you in the door, your classes (should help) get you through the interview.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Generally you just read in the whole file, make the change, and overwite the file with the new data. So it can really be done in any language.</p>

<p>As for the simplest, since you mentioned UNIX, I&#39;m guessing that means shell commands are ok? If so I&#39;d just use <code>sed</code> to perform a search and replace on that. Otherwise, pick a language, read the whole file in, modify it, and save it out.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Hmm. That looks ok (unless something is wrong in the subtract, multiply and normailse functions). Have you tried debugging it to see that the values returned are correct? In the shader the value of lambCoef should fluctuate. If they are constant, then you may have faulty dot multiplication code.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yup.  Perfect! </p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming">The Odin Project</a> (chapter 3 is Ruby and self contained)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Thanks for all that help! I now know where to start!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>To be honest that would be my response if I read my question(albeit less detailed). The reason I thought I would use C++ is because it seems like it would be more useful and easier(just simple things like debugging, variable declaration etc) for things outside of this field that I can apply in work.</p>

<p>Cryptography is an interest and I don&#39;t see myself implementing anything anytime soon that will be used beyond my own research as I know that this is pretty much a big no-no unless you know EXACTLY what you are doing in terms of theory and code implementation. I also thought it would be an interesting learning experience to transcribe the code to another language, thus teaching myself some C in the process. A lot of the other participants are using python, go, ruby etc and the instructor doesn&#39;t seem to advise against this, I think that it&#39;s because the class is geared towards the theory. </p>

<p>I know people who work in the area tend to study the subject heavily and some languages are better equipped to deal with certain problems than others so I can definately see your point.</p>

<p>Maybe, since I have a year to use the voucher to re-enroll, I&#39;ll look at them both(I&#39;m only part-time at the moment so have plenty of free time). My main issue at the moment is finding something I can work on so I can learn a language fully as opposed to occasionally using a language for a particular function. Crypto is interesting to me as I always enjoyed math and problem solving. I 100% see your point when it comes to knowledge of the language for something so important, thanks for the feedback it&#39;s very much appreciated!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I hate sql. I actually did that exact statement, and it only returned one row, and didnt show the other products. But now, it works. Its so confusing sometimes. Thanks though, you were right.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Perfect!  Great answer.  We can also do the following : build a min heap of all the elements(O(n))  and then remove k elements from it (O(klogn)).  So this solution is either O(n)  or O(klogn)  whichever is higher.  I think it is better than what you wrote as there the complexity is O(nlogk)  which I think is higher than O(n)  or O(klogn).  But the idea is the same.  </p>

<p>I&#39;d use a max heap of size k. Iterate through the array and compare each element to the max. If n[i] &gt; max, move on to the next element in the array. If n[i] &lt; max, add n[i] to the heap and remove the max from the heap.</p>

<p>Time complexity: O(n log k)</p>

<p>Space complexity: O(k)</p>

<p>Logic (since this is <a href="/r/learnprogramming">/r/learnprogramming</a>): We&#39;re looking for a subset of the smallest k numbers. Therefore, the largest value within the subset should still be smaller than every other value within n that is not contained within k. Building off of this, by creating a data structure of k elements, we create a container for our subset. If we then find the max of this subset and continuously compare it to every element in the array, we can then find every k values smaller than the max of the current data structure in one run of the array.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I chose max heap because it&#39;s a very efficient data structure for exposing the maximum of a set of numbers. After all, in a subset of k smallest numbers, the max of k should still be less than the other elements in the array not in k. </p>

<p>For time complexity calculations, comparing an element to max takes O(1). Inserting into a max heap takes O(log k). Iterating through an array takes O(n). At worst case scenario, our smallest k values are stored in the end of the array as modeled in the example above, so we would have to insert a new value into the heap at every index in the array, or in other words perform a O(log k) operation n times. Therefore the worst case time complexity is O(n log k).</p>

<p>For space complexity, since we are creating only one data structure of size k, our space complexity is O(k).</p>

<p>You can also modify this to find the k largest elements by using min heap instead of max heap.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>great, just wanted to make sure that you get the idea first :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>use version control and loggers. They usually tell you where shit went to hell</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Actually, if I can get you back for a second. When you say </p>

<p>&quot;self.myTableView.dataSource = &lt;#INSERT_DATA_SOURCE_HERE&gt;&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s the data source delegate I meant. When you&#39;re using UITableView, that object will usually be the view controller, as will the delegate.</p>

<p>&quot;self.myTableView.dataSource = CustomTableViewController&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;self.myTableView.delegate= CustomTableViewController&quot;</p>

<p>And then CustomTableViewController will have an object like an array, which contains the actual data that is displayed.</p>

<p>So your saying that it&#39;s fine to change self.myTableView.dataSource during runtime? What about the actual data source, the array? That should be left unchanged during runtime?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Very nice. What are the differences between what I did and what you did? Did I do it wrong even though it works? </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sedgewick has the same book of Algorithms for C++.</p>

<p>Edit:though after reading what <a href="/u/maserak">/u/maserak</a>  wrote,  I remembered that the pivot element can be chosen in a good way and thus you were right.  O(n). </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>yeah I made 2 arguments and added an extra raw input for n at the top of my script. I thought it worked fine.</p>

<p>I dont remember what the script says now because for the next part of the study drill I had to delete a lot of it to create a for-loop and I added a range(7) </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a quick and easy answer to this.<br/>
It&#39;s a multi step process, analysis &gt; design &gt; implementation.<br/>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development_process</a>  </p>

<p>The design process should identify modules, which you can connect via defined interfaces. This divides your project into smaller independent pieces.<br/>

<p>I finished watching TheNewBoston&#39;s video tutorials.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why <em>theNewBoston</em>? He is a discouraged resource as he doesn&#39;t follow common conventions, does not explain concepts well, etc.</p>

<p>Did you just watch the tutorials, or did you <em>actually program along</em>?</p>

<p>Just watching the tutorials is like watching an instruction video for swimming without ever going into the water.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Agreed, hence I asked for time and space complexity. Let us assume k=1, this algorithm will take O(nlogn) time, which is not optimal as minimum element can be found in O(n) time. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah I&#39;ve been thinking about moving to US to work after I finish my CS degree but there are good and bad sides to it. I currently live 15 minutes away from my job. I&#39;m pretty sure I couldn&#39;t do that in NY.</p>

<p>For some reason US pays average $80k for programmers and Europe (UK, Germany, France for example) around 40-50k.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m a C++ developer, and I&#39;d say Java and C++ are both equally in demand in the industry.</p>

<p>From what you&#39;ve said, I gathered this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You&#39;re interested in Android development, which tempts you to learn Java.</p></li>
<li><p>Your job requires C++ knowledge, but you aren&#39;t sure that apart from its title, your&#39;re gonna be interested in it.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;d say it&#39;s a personal choice - keep in mind that Java is fairly simpler than C++ to pick up, although C++ isn&#39;t as bad as Reddit makes it out to be sometimes, and C++11/14 is actually resembling a high level language than let&#39;s say, C.</p>

<p>Regarding your second question, you&#39;re basically asking &quot;with a background in desktop, mobile and web development, would companies hire me as a developer?&quot;, which is insane, IMO. If you have the slightest thing to show for those, you&#39;re ahead of the pack already for most companies that aren&#39;t Google, MS, Palantir, etc. (you&#39;ll get there with more practice though, not just as self-taught beginner).</p>

<p>For your third question, I say once you&#39;ve learned Java, you wouldn&#39;t transfer to C++ unless you <em>absolutely</em> need to. Specially if you&#39;re gonna eventually move onto Android, it&#39;s fair to assume C++ is never gonna concern you, unless it must for some reason.</p>

<p>Hope this helps. You know more programming than me, but I read a lot about this stuff and ask around people practicing in it, and what I said was a summary of that.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>When I first started taking Java, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sams-Teach-Yourself-Covering-Android/dp/0672335743/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428689783&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Sams+Teach+Yourself+Java+in+21+Days">this book</a> helped me out tremendously.  There are some excellent samples of code throughout the book and if you still don&#39;t quite understand what is being covered, you can always find help through sites like <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/search/?ref=home&amp;q=java">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/courses?search_query=java">edX</a>.  The cool thing about edX is that, in most cases, you have a choice to either audit the course or pay to take the course and receive certification that you can then use on your resume.</p>

<p>Another thing, you won&#39;t learn anything by just watching videos.  Java (and other programming languages) are learned through actual hands-on work.  In order to learn a language, you must use what you learn!</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;ll never stop learning new things about a language.  Just like you keep learning new words in English you&#39;ll always be able to find some new subtlety in a language.  Once you get a little more seasoned you&#39;ll start seeing that the languages aren&#39;t usually the difficult part, but learning the frameworks that they&#39;re used in.  Writing console apps is a great way to start programming, but the next step is thinking: Am I writing a desktop app? A mobile app? A web app?  What frameworks are available for doing that in the language I&#39;m learning?  Is this language appropriate or are there better technologies that will allow me to meet requirements with less time? </p>

<p>As far as not being able to solve a programming question in an interview, I am reminded something one of my professors said- He had just gotten called in by a bunch of PhDs on one of his last tests before receiving his MBA.  He had attempted to solve a problem and the solution was flawed, but he passed because &quot;He got it wrong, but the way he tried to solve it was interesting.&quot;  </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah, I see now, strange how that wasn&#39;t caught, but yeah, FIRST | FIRST doesn&#39;t equate to REVERSE, guessing a problem with order of operations? </p>

<p>What about 16 OR 32?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>so the terminology is pretty loose, usually the whole number storing all the bit flags is called a bit field, and you use the masks to isolate the bits in order to set or check them. if you say a bitmask or bitfield or a bitset, people will know what you mean.</p>

<p>in C you don&#39;t need to do the == flag part because any non-0 number evaluates to true, and &amp; by the nature of the mask the result will be 0 unless the mask bit is set. between</p>

<pre><code>if (options &amp; MASK)
</code></pre>

<p>and </p>

<pre><code>if (SELECTED(options, MASK))

<p>I&#39;d say they&#39;re both pretty clear as long as you use decent names for the variable and mask constants.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah yes, the ol&#39; pritnf() function, a sure sign of actual code that was compiled and run.  </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The way the &quot;include directories&quot; works is: take the path from the &quot;additional include directories&quot; and add the path from your <code>#include</code> to it.</p>

<p>Currently in your config you have set up the &quot;D:\build3\SFML-2.2\include\SFML&quot; path, and your include is `#include &lt;SFML/Graphics.hpp&gt;, so the final path will be &quot;D:\build3\SFML-2.2\include\SFML\SFML/Graphics.hpp&quot;, which is not correct.</p>

<p>Take a look at SFML&#39;s guide again: <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/images/start-vc-paths.png">http://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.0/images/start-vc-paths.png</a> .

</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, I&#39;ve heard of bitmasks before, but didn&#39;t think that&#39;s what it was meant to be. Quick question though, in a function (I haven&#39;t compiled  my project yet, nor tested it, so until I finally implement everything want to do, I normally just test the code in ideone until then), to check to see if a certain flag was passed to the parameter, I used a macro that pretty much does something like</p>

<pre><code> #define SELECTED(parameter, flag)((parameter &amp; flag) == flag)
</code></pre>

<p>which is used as such...</p>

<pre><code> if(SELECTED(parameter, FIRST)) { ... }
</code></pre>

<p>Is that valid for checking it? Also, would it be more accurate to call it a mask or a flag?  Is each macro considered a bit mask, or is the process of checking of whether or not the macro can be extracted from the parameter be considered bit masking? Kind of confused on terminology here.</p>

<p>Also, questioning the whole 1 &lt;&lt; n thing going on here. Is that safer than predefined options? I see that it does make it rather convenient to just use something like that though, I&#39;ll definitely use it myself.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>

<p>Therefore you have no reason to be using <code>float</code>. Use <code>double</code> if floating point is acceptable. But you shouldn&#39;t be using floating point for monetary amounts.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m guessing you want this to be a custom webpage? Not Google slides?</p>

<p>I would have the slides hosted on your site (as images of course). Then write a simple JS script to cycle through them, reloading them from their directory. This will cause them to update every time you change the image on the server.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That is a premature micro-optimization, unless you have actual data demonstrating that the use of <code>double</code> values has a measurable and significant negative effect on your program&#39;s performance or memory footprint.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I feel you. I&#39;m working on a remote team of five, two of which are development based (myself and the lead). I was looking over my proto-code last night and lost all drive and motivation because, fuck, it&#39;s a damn fine mess. Then I google the issue I&#39;m having and see people saying &quot;Oh, it&#39;s easy here&#39;s what you do&quot; and then I look back at my code and feel like I&#39;m shitting on everybody who programmed before me.</p>

<p>But then I remembered learning guitar in my early teens. I&#39;m also a singer, and I never really had to practice at that, I guess I just have a voice, so I expected guitar to be the same thing... but after months of playing <em>Smoke on the Water</em>, and <em>Come as You Are</em> until they were perfect, I realised that wasn&#39;t the case.</p>

<p>Messy, half working code is a good opportunity to learn, and figure out how to make it not messy, and work 99.99~% of the time. To be a &quot;real dev&quot; you have to go through the mistakes and learn from them. I think once you stop putting those who can program on a pedastal and focus on your own stuff, it becomes a hell of a lot easier.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Yeah. I&#39;m getting 11€ ($12) an hour. which is about the same as $10 in US considering living expenses in Finland. Programmers average pay is around 50k a year though because there are too many unemployed programmers in Finland after Nokia went down so employers can pay less. It&#39;s bit of a shame.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>By not ever using floating point for money. Floating point is for when you need enormous range but only a limited precision. You will not get the exact values the user types, because not all decimal fractions are representable as binary fractions. Use integers.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Can anyone suggest somewhere to post?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>probably the search box in the google front page. I doubt you&#39;re the first person to need to restore a CVS repository.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Where I would check to see if the parameters added up to a certain amount?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No, you check each flag separately by ANDing it out of the parameter. Read about the logic (and bitwise) AND operator.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does that mean I should number each new macro in orders of 2n (powers of 2)? </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, the values should be powers of two, or they should at least be non-overlapping so that when you extract them with AND inside the function, there is no confusion about which flag is in which bits.</p>

<p>You essientially have a binary value, the parameter, and let each bit represent a particular flag. So if that bit is 1, then that flag has been passed, and if it&#39;s 0 then that flag was not passed. You assemble all the flags to pass by ORing the values together:</p>

<pre><code>   00010000
OR 00000100
OR 01000000
 = 01010100
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Another concern, what if a double parameter is passed? Then they&#39;d get unintended results, right? As shown in ideone, passing FIRST | FIRST would be the same as if REVERSE was passed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>No. true or true is just true, and so 1 OR 1 is 1, not some other value. The operations are bitwise; the values in one bit column does not affect the result in another bit column.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It produces some rather strange digits, like 16 + 32 should have been 48 as I thought it would, but it turned out to be 54.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Post an example that demonstrates it. 16 OR 32 should be 48.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It really depends on what you want to do. Do you want to go further into web development? Do you want to try out some of the other things you can do with your new skills?</p>

<p>Honestly, after you&#39;ve acquired a good base of skills, the best way to learn more is to find things you want to do and learn how to do them. </p>

<p>Thats one of the reasons Real Python is such a great resource for people wanting to learn python. They give a great introduction to the language and programming, and then give a good introduction to several things you can do with your new skills (PDFs, web scraping, data analysis, SQL, etc) before moving on to the bulk of their content, web development and frameworks.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t completed the Odin Project, but it seems like you should have a decent web development foundation. Try building something and use that to learn where you are deficient and need to learn more. Then you can find MOOCs or courses to support it.</p>

<p>A lot of the skills you&#39;ll build from here on out won&#39;t be primarily from courses (unless its something like algorithms, which might be a good place to continue), but rather from google or stack overflow.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Head First Java is a great introduction to object oriented programming in Java, and will help solidify some important concepts early on.  Some people don&#39;t like the style (it has cartoons/crossword puzzles/etc. every once-in-a-while to keep in interesting), but it does a great job of explaining concepts that are usually foreign to new programmers.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Depends on how you define a good career choice...</p>

<p>Plenty of companies use &quot;ancient&quot; stuff like COBOL or AS400. While the pool of those servers isn&#39;t getting larger, neither is the pool of programmers for them. </p>

<p>You can learn to program for those and get &quot;golden handcuffs&quot; - high paying positions for knowledge that really can&#39;t be transferred anywhere else.</p>

<p>Good career choice? High paying job sounds good... not being able to change jobs doesn&#39;t, but if you get paid well?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Do libraries count? I mean, I can write a web-server in C in just a few lines:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;awesomewebserver.h&gt;

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    launch_awesome_webserver();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Note that this <em>does</em> require the use of the AwesomeWebServer library.</p>

<p>Even if you say that it has to be <em>standard</em> libraries, some languages just include more in their standard libraries than others. That&#39;s doesn&#39;t really say if the language is terse or verbose or anything, it just says what&#39;s in the standard library. It&#39;s about the eco-system more than the <em>language</em>.</p>

<p>A great place to start. Use it while its still free!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Got it, thanks.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/">I use this website for reference</a>.</p>

<p>Once you know a couple languages, as others have said, most start to blur together (with the exception of PHP and HTML. Screw those non JavaScript webdev languages. No consistency).</p>

<p>Once you are at that point, I just go to that website and learn the differences in syntax. For example, let&#39;s say we wanted to learn C#.</p>

<p>We go click on <a href="http://hyperpolyglot.org/cpp">C++, Objective-C, Java, C#</a></p>

<p>Then we compare it to the languages similar to it to the side that I already know (for me, Java would be the best of those four).</p>

<p>I look at Hello World, whats the differences between its and Javas? No String[] args in mains parameters, and the print statement is Console.WriteLine instead of System.out.println.</p>

<p>Now lets go find how to do methods. Control-F &quot;methods&quot;,</p>

<p>Everything seems to be really similar here. I do see that calling a math function is similar, but it&#39;s System.Math.Abs instead of Math.Abs.</p>

<p>Doing stuff like this to find the differences, you can then go in Notepad++ or the IDE of your choice, and start trying it out. Decide &quot;I am going to write a program which does x to a string&quot;, and figure out how to do it.</p>

<p>If you find something that isn&#39;t on that site, or you don&#39;t understand it and want a better understanding, just google &quot;How to &lt;solve problem&gt; in &lt;language&gt;&quot;. </p>

<p>&quot;How to do regular expressions in C#&quot;. Stuff like that.</p>

<p>From those two things, going through that site and googling, you can learn a basic understanding of any language. Through practicing with that knowledge, you can gain a slightly deeper understanding and hold onto that knowledge for longer.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>self.myTableView.dataSource = &lt;#INSERT_DATA_SOURCE_HERE&gt;.   </p>

<p>The datasource delegate you speak of cannot change once you setup the methods. Your datasource object that you are using though on the other hand can be modified with proper methods. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I knew about the difference in capitalization standards, but I totally forgot Java still doesn&#39;t have auto implemented properties yet. One of the many reasons I prefer C# over Java. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You should use visual basic its a scripting language that has all the power of .net that you want and it&#39;ll be a lot easier than using swing, awt or javafx.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>OR isn&#39;t addition... FIRST | FIRST == FIRST still. FIRST | REVERSE == 3. You can&#39;t use summation to figure out if a bit is set, you can do something like</p>

<pre><code>bool isFirstSet = FIRST &amp; mask;
bool isReverseSet = REVERSE &amp; mask;
</code></pre>

<p>Using bits inside an integer to identify multiple states is called a bit mask, it&#39;s kind of like having 32 booleans inside one 32 bit integer. The only way it works is if the bits used by the individual flags are mutually exclusive.</p>

<p>personally I like to do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define FLAG1 1 &lt;&lt; 0
#define FLAG2 1 &lt;&lt; 1
#define FLAG3 1 &lt;&lt; 2
#define FLAG4 1 &lt;&lt; 3
#define FLAG5 1 &lt;&lt; 4
</code></pre>
</div><div class="md"><p>Makes sense, thanks. A follow up: one of the problems I&#39;m having is with the ambiguity regarding the meaning of data source. There&#39;s the literal data source object, like, an array of objects or a Core Data data context, and then there&#39;s the data source delegate, which implements the UITableViewDataSource protocol. In your example, do you mean to change the UITableView&#39;s data source delegate, or do you mean to just change the data source variable within the data source delegate?</p>

<p>Seems to me that unless you have a specific need for different implementations of the UITableViewDataSource methods, it makes more sense to just swap out the variable rather than code a new data source delegate for every data source.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I believe Java doesn&#39;t have getters/setters like you do in lines 10-12. You would actually make methods called setHitPoints and getHitPoints. </p>

<p>Also, method names aren&#39;t capitalized in java</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This was the exact reason I started using version control/Git.   Had to keep myself detailed notes with every commit so I can remember :p</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There are times when you simply don&#39;t know your data structure until the runtime. If I have to go download data of the internet there is no way that I can know what my data is going to look like. Im going to need to set the datasource during run time to that structure. If my data changes because I just did another query, I should switch my data source to the new object that is now a better representation of what my data is. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>He said coding is similar....</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>In Java, methods are divided into two categories: static (class) and instance methods.  With static methods (also called <em>class methods</em>), you don&#39;t need an object.  They behave like C functions (if you&#39;re familiar with that).  Instance methods require an object.</p>

<p>Thus, you could have:</p>

<pre><code>public class Foo {
   public static int add(int x, int y) {
       return x + y;
   }
}
</code></pre>

<p>and call it like:</p>

<pre><code>Foo.add(2, 3);
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, you are referring to the class name, but not to an object.</p>

<p>Then, you might have an instance method.</p>

<pre><code>public class Rectangle {
    private int width;  // instance variable
    private int height; // instance variable

    public int computeArea() {
         return width * height;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong>computeArea()</strong> is an instance method, and requires an object.  How do you create an object?  Normally, you do something like:</p>

<pre><code>Rectangle r = new Rectangle(2, 3);
</code></pre>

<p>The new operator creates a new Rectangle object.  But how is this coded up?</p>

<pre><code>public class Rectangle {
    private int width; // instance variable
    private int height; // instance variable

    // This is a constructor   
    public Rectangle(int widthIn, int heightIn) {
         width = widthIn;
         height = heightIn;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>To write a constructor, you write public, followed by the name of the class, followed by a parameter list.  The purpose of the constructor is to build a new object and set the instance variables to a legitimate value (currently, we don&#39;t check if <strong>widthIn</strong> has a non-negative value).</p>

<p>Thus, when you write:</p>

<pre><code>Rectangle r = new Rectangle(2, 3);
</code></pre>

<p>it looks for the constructor <strong>public Rectangle</strong> which can accept two integers, and sets the value of <strong>widthIn</strong> to 2 and <strong>heightIn</strong> to 3.  These values are then used to set the instance variables <strong>width</strong> and <strong>height</strong> to 2 and 3 respectively.</p>

<p>Once you have created an object, you can call instance methods on it, like</p>

<pre><code>r.getWidth();
</code></pre>

<p>which could be implemented as:</p>

<pre><code>public class Rectangle {
    // stuff
    public int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Does that help?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I suggest you use the same language as your instructor... because cryptography is hard.</p>

<p>Crypto is really, really, really, really hard to do right, mainly because it is so, so, so easy to not do right.</p>

<p>Part of &quot;not doing it right&quot; includes not understanding how a language is doing a specfic thing. An example is a bug introduced into debian&#39;s ssl by someone who &quot;fixed&quot; an issue with using uninitialized memory. A <em>very good</em> understanding of the language pointed them to the conclusion that this was an issue to be fixed.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, what they really needed was a <em>very very very good</em> understanding of the language to know that this was done intentionally and the uninitialized memory was being used as a source of entropy. Initializing that memory actually <em>reduced</em> the entropy. <a href="https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=363516">Whoops!</a></p>

<p>You don&#39;t have the very high level of understanding required to catch these mistakes, but your instructor does (or at least is closer) and you can ride their wisdom. I don&#39;t think that for your situation, divorcing yourself from that domain specific expertise by voluntarily choosing to use a different language is wise.</p>

<p>As you alluded, there is a great deal of transferrable skills between c/c++. I think you could spin your argument 180 degrees and instead say &quot;since they&#39;re so close, why NOT use c?&quot;</p>

<p>You&#39;re misunderstanding what I meant, which is fine, because it does come off as dismissive and I could have articulated myself better. </p>

<p>The reason I said that wasn&#39;t to point out the obvious they don&#39;t understand it. What I meant when I said that is that a deeper understanding of how I/O functions work (what they do) is essential for using them correctly. </p>

<p>You can see it for beginnings in C with I/O and with memory management repeatedly on this subreddit and other places that people don&#39;t approach things from a place of trying to understand how something works, but instead from a place of trying to figure out some behavior they&#39;re experiencing.</p>

<p>My perspective, in C, I/O and memory management especially is <em>hard</em> to understand. So my advice is to start form a place of trying to understand the thing. Understand what a <code>malloc</code> call is doing. Understand what function the I/O buffers perform. Don&#39;t approach it form the position of &quot;I want to <em>do</em> this.&quot;</p>

<p>That&#39;s my position anyway, I hope that makes my statement clearer. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve done memory management work in C and came to learn that pointers are evil. But, I suppose in cases like this they do have their uses. I&#39;ll change the vector to pointers then, thank you :)</p>

<p>I miss Java.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I did not. Thank you. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I shall do a vector of pointers, I know how to do them :)</p>

<p>I thought it was strange that a vector was able to hold a superclass considering the size of subclasses can vary - however i assumed that it may in the background be some sort of linked list sort of structure, making sizing irrelevant.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes. When you store something of type <code>subclass</code> in the vector which stores <code>superclass</code>s you are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_slicing">slicing</a> your object. In C++, you have to be much more focused on how things are happening in memory. A subclass object is essentially a superclass object with some stuff tacked on the end. When you store a subclass object in only enough space as a superclass object, the stuff and the end falls off, and you have an <em>actual</em> superclass object, not a subclass object at all.</p>

<p>For inheritance to work, you can&#39;t do that. You need to reference or a pointer to a superclass object so the entire object is intact. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, the vector bit is <em>key</em>. That&#39;s why you need to provide <em>complete</em> code examples.</p>

<p>You are running into the &quot;slicing problem&quot;. When you add a &quot;Sub&quot; object to the vector, all the &quot;Sub&quot; bits are cut off, because the vector is a vector of Super objects <em>only</em>. There&#39;s no room to hold the extra &quot;Sub&quot; bits, so they can&#39;t be added.</p>

<p>How to fix this? Well, there are a couple of ways. One easy way is to declare the vector to be a vector of <em>pointers</em> to Super. A better way (?) would be to use smart pointers, but that might add complications where you don&#39;t want them.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If the thread was asking about single &quot;verified certificates&quot; i would be in relatively total agreement with you.

<p>Their documentation is a bit lacking but if you use AJAX to get the URLs listed there, you should be able to parse the responses as JSON and find the data you need. I can provide more information later but I have to run right now.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Actually, could it be because this is how I am calling the function?</p>

        i-&gt;printEverythingOut();
    }

<p>My setup is that I have a superclass vector where I am placing a mix of different subclasses inside it. I am looping through the vector calling the printEverthingOut function on each element. Am I doing it wrong?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>There is no error. It compiles perfectly fine. It is just that it is using the superclass rather than the subclass for the method. Even though I am calling printEverythingOut from a subclass instance.</p>

<p>Regardless! Learning by doing is an excellent way to understand something. Try making yourself more comfortable with how the individual functions used in IO works: <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fscanf">http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fscanf</a> Take a look at what each function returns and think about how you can put them together to get your desired functionality.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Could it be Scala or lisp? I know those have a lot of parentheses. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Well, firstly, I think the function name &quot;<code>numberOfVertices</code>&quot; is misleading because you not returning the number of vertices in the graph. </p>

<p>Now, as for your problem, you have to <em>understand</em> how I/O works. When the file reaches the end, it doesn&#39;t go back to the beginning again. It&#39;s done; there&#39;s no more file left to read. You&#39;d have to set the position manually if you want to read the file from the beginning again.</p>

<p>But, that isn&#39;t what you want. What you want is to write a function which processes the file and returns some kind of data structure which holds the information that you need. I/O is an expensive process. There&#39;s no need to continually read from a file and then read from it again and again.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You are reading until you hit the end of the file, and then you keep reading. A file doesn&#39;t automatically reset to the start when you hit EOF, you have to reset it yourself. For that, you can use <code>fseek()</code> or <code>rewind()</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>The problem isn&#39;t the &quot;tone&quot;... the problem is the attitude and opinion.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the &quot;opinion&quot; in question is that the program OP posted is not a C program. This is perfectly verifiable and undeniably true, not some opinion of mine. The &quot;attitude&quot; I suppose is the attitude that it makes a difference which language the program is in and that it&#39;s important that OP states clearly and correctly which language it is.</p>

<p>The <em>tone</em>, on the other hand, is the jocularity of my comment which you interpreted as abuse. But now you&#39;re saying that it <em>wasn&#39;t</em> the &quot;liar&quot; bit that upset you, but the opinion and the attitude?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The differences between C, C++, C# and Romulan... aren&#39;t something I would think a beginner would know.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I on the other hand think that OP probably <em>could</em> tell the difference between C and Romulan, and that he <em>would</em> learn something from having the difference between C and C++ pointed out to him, and that it <em>does</em> pay off to tell him.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Calling the questioner a &quot;liar&quot; - or a &quot;filthy liar&quot; - is at the very least incorrect: How can you &quot;lie&quot; about something you are learning about? Uninformed? Uneducated? Maybe... but liar?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So what I&#39;m learning here is that with some people, tone doesn&#39;t travel across the internet even when you point it out. So, to be completely explicit: I called OP a liar tongue-in-cheek, thinking that it was a pretty obvious joke. Since it didn&#39;t get across to everybody, I proposed to add &quot;filthy&quot; to make it blatantly obvious that it was not meant seriously. The phrase &quot;filthy liar&quot; is almost exclusively used as a joke, and certainly it must be taken as a joke when it is so completely out of place as here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Other than that, again, it&#39;s rude and uncalled for.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So even without calling OP a liar, it would still be rude and uncalled for to correct him on misidentifying the programming language? I have to disagree. It is an important point and someone has to point it out to him.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>hhmmm....</p>

<p>I tried removing it and the output from the function is still that of the superclass. However, both versions compile just fine.</p>

<p>Strangely, I am still getting a warning saying that the print methods are virtual (and destructor is not) when I remove virtual from the header.</p>

<p>I wonder if eclipse is the thing having a brainfart?</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to try compiling it elsewhere and see what happens because it all seems right to me.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve never had this happen before, but it makes sense.</p>

<p>What I experience is trying to figure out the best way to do something for hours, then I go take a shower and figure out a genius way in the first 5 minutes. And sometimes I discover and solve other problems that I wasn&#39;t working on without seeing the code (while in the shower of course).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A class is basically a code template for describing an object. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re building a simple space invader game. A single invader will have properties belonging to it: perhaps hit points for health, and x/y coordinates related to its position on the screen. A constructor is called at the time of instantiation (creation). Constructors are used mainly for setting initial values in an object. Methods are basically a procedure within a class that know how to modify state. In this example you might have a method that registers a hit and reduces the hp by an amount specified. You might have another method that moves the coordinates of the invader by a specified amount. Each invader on the screen would be a different instance of this class (an object), and each would have it&#39;s own values for those properties. The code for a space invader class may look something like:</p>

<pre><code>public class Invader{
    //a class constructor sets the initial values for properties when an object is created
    public Invader(){
        this.HitPoints = 60;
        this.XCoord = 0;
        this.YCoord = 0;
    }

    //publicly accessible properties on the class
    public int HitPoints {get;set;}
    public int XCoord {get;set;}
    public int YCoord {get;set;}

    //a publicly accessible method to reduce hp by numerOfPoints
    public void ReduceHealth(int numberOfPoints){
        this.HitPoints = this.HitPoints - numberOfPoints;
    }

    //a publicly accessible method to move coordinates
    public void MoveInvader(int x, int y){
        this.XCoord = this.XCoord + x;
        this.YCoord = this.YCoord + y;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Let&#39;s say you don&#39;t want a space invader to start at coordinates 0,0 with only 60hp. You could create a constructor that takes in values as parameters:</p>

<pre><code>public Invader(int hitPoints, int xCoord, int yCoord){
    this.HitPoints = hitPoints;
    this.XCoord = xCoord;
    this.YCoord = yCoord;
}
</code></pre>

<p>You would call this constructor in another class responsible for dealing with invaders:</p>

<pre><code>//creates an invader object with 100 hp at the coordinates 5,5
Invader invader = new Invader(100,5,5);
</code></pre>

<p>You might have a method in a controlling class that registers when a hit occurs, and at that time you would want to reduce the invader&#39;s health by calling its ReduceHealth method:</p>

<pre><code>//this would reduce the hp of the invader object by 20
invader.ReduceHealth(20);
</code></pre>

<p>The syntax may go against Java standards because I&#39;ve been in C# for a few years, and it&#39;s missing a lot of the details, but hopefully it helps with the gist.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Haha. No, I&#39;m not trying to do anything like that. I simply got the urge to write a web client that consumes the socket and binds to a view using a new front-end framework I&#39;m testing out.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you&#39;re looking for a way to get around their security or click the button more than once, you can&#39;t. Trust me. They&#39;re doing pretty much everything server-side. They generate a unique hash based on the timestamp that a tick is sent down from the server combined with some other unknown value which you cannot duplicate. They then send that hash back up the websockets connection on a click to verify that it&#39;s valid. Trust me, I&#39;ve tried.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Remove virtual from your subclass and it should work (unless I&#39;m having a brainfart)</p>

<p>Everything I mentioned above works now when I do it this way and the strings print out properly, but I&#39;m confused. I created static final values for the defaults to pass to the extra constructor since they&#39;ll never change, but is there a better way to do this? Seems like I could use a learning opportunity here as well.</p>

<p>Shit, I just noticed OP&#39;s project is called &quot;projectcycle&quot;. I was just piggybacking off the original &quot;cycle&quot; comment you made.

</div><div class="md"><p>Interested in this answer since I hope to be there at some point as well. :) </p>

<p>Personally, I switched over to cs50 on EdX when I was halfway into The Odin Project, because I felt I needed a better grounding. If you finished the course, that may end up being too remedial for you. But it&#39;s very well done and free. You could take a look at the syllabus and skip ahead if you see anything that you&#39;d like to learn.</p>

<p>This adds an event listener to the chart&#39;s <code>select</code> method which gets the selected item and sets the corresponding row on the dataTable to selected (removes the column because you can only select whole rows). It also adds an event listener to the dataTable&#39;s <code>select</code> method that gets the selected item and sets the corresponding row on the chart to selected.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>My general rule of thumb for putting a language into my resume is if I could use it to parse data from a CSV, send it over a socket, display that to a user, then take input from that user, send it back over the same socket, and write it into the original file.  Once you are past that point, I feel that your knowledge of algorithms, databases, etc. which transfers easily across languages is more relevant than some syntax you could easily Google.</p>

<p><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.break.php">http://php.net/manual/en/control-structures.break.php</a></p>

<p>It is a badly designed feature.</p>

<p>Java has a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/branch.html">labeled <code>break</code> statement</a> to accomplish this, and that is a much better way to do it. Perl has a labeled <code>break</code> statement too, except <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/last.html"><code>break</code> is spelled <code>last</code> in Perl</a>.</p>

<p>But a <em>numbered</em> <code>break</code> statement (as opposed to a <em>labeled</em> <code>break</code> statement) is not a very good design. To figure out where a numbered <code>break</code> statement branches to, you have to count nested blocks—but only nested loops and <code>switch</code> blocks, not <code>if</code> blocks, because those don&#39;t count. If you realize that you need to insert another layer of looping in your code, or you decide to replace an <code>if</code> statement with a <code>switch</code>, your numbered <code>break</code> statements might not refer to the same loop they did before, so you need to patch that up.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Yes. But if all of your friends are using different languages they&#39;ll have a hard time working together. Besides; it&#39;s a waste of time for you. Learning programming isn&#39;t about languages; once they are experienced to a certain degree they can switch to another language by itself. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think you need to do a bunch of fixing up of server your code in and around line 54.  You&#39;re trying to use one loop for two different things: Repeating until they enter a correct word and also iterating through your array of correct words.  That&#39;s messy and needlessly complicated.  You&#39;re better off just using an outer loop to repeat until they give a correct response and an inner, nested loop to iterate through your array of secret words.  (There are other, more Perl-ish ways to replace that inner-loop, but that may be outside the scope of the assignment.)</p>

<p>Another issue is that when someone enters an incorrect secret word, you don&#39;t bother reading a new secret word.  So the program continues to check against the previously entered word, which is obviously still incorrect.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>chr-- is almost the same as chr = chr - 1</p>

<p>--chr is almost the same as chr = chr - 1</p>

<p>The difference is the value they return(a value which is often not used, but it is in your code)</p>

<p>chr-- returns the value of chr <em>before</em> it is decremented. </p>

<p>--chr returns the value of chr <em>after</em> it is decremented. </p>

<p>Essentially, your code says: &quot;assign chr2 to the value of chr1, then assign chr1 to ch1 - 1.&quot; </p>

<p>Doing the above <em>compiles the program without running it</em> It is a very good way to find out about issues before you try to use the program. There are some more Perl command line commands in the link below<br/>

<p>If I remember right strict stops you creating variables by typing $variable. Instead it forces you to makes you type my when you make a variable. I might be wrong but in the client script you have</p>

<p>$statement and $statment. With strict it will fail to run the program because you never typed <em>my $statment</em>.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. I&#39;m still quite new (and poor) at perl.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Okay thanks, I appreciate it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why don&#39;t you try? :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Some languages have similar constructs, for example Java has &quot;break with label&quot;, while in others (for example, C) you can use a goto to achieve the same results. Personally, I try to avoid writing nested loops and would probably put the functionality of your inner loop into a separate function.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>Is this a terrible idea for a language feature?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s prone to create hard to follow logic, so IMHO yes. It&#39;s similar to how a goto can be abused.</p>

<p>If you need to something similar to this you can either throw an exception (if it&#39;s in fact an error state, make your logic more sensible or set a &#39;continue&#39; flag that the loops above it check). I&#39;d try to go for option 2: you normally pretty much never need to do this.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>This is disallowed on the client for security reasons. Requesting data from a domain other than your own (that you do not control) could allow something called a cross-site scripting attack (XSS) which is why browsers will block this kind of behavior by default. The only way to do this is using a server proxy and it&#39;s generally frowned upon and considered a bad idea anyway. Here is a relevant StackOverflow answer: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2558977/ajax-cross-domain-call">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2558977/ajax-cross-domain-call</a></p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The idea behind the &quot;hat&quot; is that the language is chosen for you. I have experience in all of the languages I mentioned. Not tons of experience, but enough so that I could get through a CS 101 course using entirely that language. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A lambda expression is basically just an anonymous function that has access to the parent scope. So it&#39;s basically a var that points to a function. It&#39;s syntax is something you sort of have to get used to but it really is pretty much just a function without a name that you define in line.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s say you have an event handler for a button in Java:</p>

<pre><code>    btn.setOnAction(new EventHandler&lt;ActionEvent&gt;() {
        @Override
        public void handle(ActionEvent event) {
            System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
        }
    });
</code></pre>

<p>In Java 8 you can do this with a much shorter lambda:</p>

<pre><code>    btn.setOnAction(
      event -&gt; System.out.println(&quot;Hello World!&quot;)
    );
</code></pre>

<p>That&#39;s all really. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You should&#39;ve read the FAQ and put in a bit more effort into your question. You should be able to edit your post.</p>

<p>Basically, what you put into your education is what you get out of it. The better your education the better the job you&#39;ll be able to get. With 3 years professional experience getting another job should not be hard at all, but you didn&#39;t bother to specify this, so no one can really answer it :)</p>
</div><div class="md"><p><strong>EDIT - this is all wrong...sorry</strong></p>

<p><del>I can&#39;t read your assignment (pastebin is blocked at work), but if you need to make multiple constructors, you have to consider what values will be passed, and essentially default them.</del></p>

<p><del>For example, let&#39;s say you&#39;re making a custom bike, and it&#39;s got the following values:</del></p>

<pre><code>private String handlebars;
private String tires
private int gears
</code></pre>

<p><del>Okay, so in this instance, you&#39;ve got three potential values for your constructor. seat, gears, tires, handlebars. Now, let&#39;s say you&#39;re making a bike, and there&#39;s a standard model, and maybe your customer only wants to add custom handlbars and seat. For a standard bike your default constructor is going to look like this:</del></p>

<pre><code>public Bike() {
    this.handlebars = &quot;standard&quot;;
    this.gears = 10;
    this.tires = &quot;standard&quot;;
}
</code></pre>

<p><del>With me so far? But now you&#39;ll get to custom stuff, and there&#39;s your special contructor. So now you need an instance where a customer only specifies one, two, or all three of those items.</del></p>

<p><del>For example:</del></p>

<pre><code>public Bike (handlebars, tire, gears) {
    this.handlebars = handlebars;
    this.tires = tire;
    this.gears = gears
}

public Bike (gears) {
    this(this.handlebars, this.tires, gears);
}
</code></pre>

<p><del>So now in this example you have three constructors. The first is an empty contructor with specific values for the default bike if no options are specified, one where handlebars are specified and everything else gets the default, and one where everything is specified custom by the input.</del></p>

<p><del>Hope this helps.</del></p>

<p>Also, if there are any errors in this, anyone, feel free to let me know. I&#39;m not entirely certain this couldn&#39;t be better (for example, maybe the 3 arg constructor should be the default, but I&#39;m not 100%);</p>

<p>Another example might be where something takes decimal versus integer input.</p>

<p>Maybe you have <code>public numberInput(int number)</code> but want it to be able to also pass doubles. So then you can just do <code>public numberInput(double number)</code> as a constructor as well to create the same functionality with a double, so either input could be passed to the same call.~~</p>

<p>What char2 = chr-- does is first assign chr to chr2, THEN decrement chr. So that&#39;s why you&#39;re getting the result you&#39;re seeing. You probably intended it to be chr2 = char - 1. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>I dislike how they focus very much on specific tech stacks / frameworks (iOS development, RoR). To me it sounds they&#39;re training code monkeys, not software engineers with a strong theoretical CS background. </p>

<p>Oh wait, they have a <a href="https://makegameswithus.hackpad.com/Make-School-Curriculum-Outline-R3tj9xUaOM2">curriculum</a>.</p>

<p>Ugh. No. The order in which you learn stuff is wrong. They teach Discrete Math for example at the <strong>end</strong>. So they&#39;re trying to teach you enough to pass interviews, not teach you a fundamental basis <strong>before</strong> you start programming. And a total of 35 hours total in Discrete Math is just laughable. </p>

<p>Seriously. Get a 4 year CS degree. This thing is only designed to put money in the owner&#39;s pockets. This is also hilarious: &quot;Our founding class is composed of Silicon Valley&#39;s next generation of leaders and thinkers&quot;</p>

<p>So let&#39;s grab the two persons at the top of that list:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Lynne previously attended UCSC. She&#39;s performed at Carnegie Hall and marched the Macy&#39;s Thanksgiving Parade. She wants to work as a game developer and designer after Make School.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A UC Berkeley graduate, Jordan has held a Top Secret clearance, traveled to Jordan, made a game about bat echolocation, and biked from SF to LA. Jordan may well be the most interesting person in Make School.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So the founders &quot;want to make games&quot; and &quot;made a game&quot;. That&#39;s their credentials? Also: it&#39;s expensive!</p>

<p>The study, presented in Italy at a conference last month and set to be published as a paper, gave 50 readers the same short story by Elizabeth George to read. Half read the 28-page story on a Kindle, and half in a paperback</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Elizabeth George study included only two experienced Kindle users, and she is keen to replicate it using a greater proportion of Kindle regulars.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, this study doesn&#39;t seem large enough or controlled enough to prove anything, based only on the information provided. Basically, 25 people read on a Kindle (device unspecified. e-reader? Fire tablet with LCD? Paperwhite, older e-ink models, Keyboard, Voyage? What?) Of those 25, 23 were unfamiliar and potentially uncomfortable with the tech, and probably spent some of their reading time figuring out how to use it, which of course would skew the numbers against their comprehension and memory retention.</p>

<p>Cross-Platform desktop apps</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You&#39;re pretty much asking for JAVA right there. C++ isn&#39;t terrible, but it can be a little difficult to find documentation on the vast wealth of libraries available to you. Additonally, if you want it to run on a different OS, you&#39;ll have to, at the very least, re-compile it for that OS, perhaps even make code changes. This is not a problem in JAVA, so long as the target runtime environment has access to a JVM.</p>

<p>Syntactically, JAVA and C++ are in the same family so that would help.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It definitely depends. Here is a StackOverflow answer on cross-compiling for every platform using C++: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25153044/c-cross-platform-compiling">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25153044/c-cross-platform-compiling</a></p>

<p>While this is a complicated process, if you need the performance that compiled C++ provides on each platform, then this is what is required. If you&#39;re just doing simple things that don&#39;t require heavy computation (like 3D graphics, statistics with large datasets, or other CPU-intensive applications) then you should be fine using something like Java or Python.</p>

<p>Both Python and Java are languages which are compiled into an intermediate language at runtime (bytecode). This is then run on a virtual machine which handles processing and system calls. they are level away from the hardware which can make them less performant in certain cases but I doubt it will matter for your applications unless they&#39;re doing the things I described above.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Unfortunately, I have already sent in a proposal saying that I would develop it with vbscript (we didn&#39;t really have any other option at the time). I&#39;m just hoping it&#39;s possible to do, as the idea behind it seems pretty simple.</p>

I think, when one is a beginner, it&#39;s easier to ask broad questions or comments like &quot;I don&#39;t get inheritance&quot;.  A live person can go back and forth trying to see what the person understands, and then work from there.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Just my personal opinion:</p>

<p>The basic question is: Are you self taught or did you get some kind of education? If it&#39;s the later then the answer is pretty simple for me: When you have your degree you&#39;re good enough to get paid for, you&#39;ll still have to learn a lot, but that happens when you&#39;re working on projects anyway.</p>

<p>It&#39;s much harder to answer if you just taught yourself everything you know. Usually there are so many skills a new developer doesn&#39;t even think of: architecture of code, unit testing, documentation, api design, etc.<br/>
Maybe I would just pick a project I am interested in and code it. If I would like the result and don&#39;t want to throw it all away, then I think it&#39;s a good sign.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Ah, thanks. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>C++ could be the right path, I don&#39;t know enough about it to push you one way or the other. Also if you do end up switching languages, I&#39;d recommend Java.

Second reason is because even if you don&#39;t get the job it gives you valuable skills for applying and going through the interview process. If you make it to the interviewing stage there should be tech questions and even if you don&#39;t know them afterwards you can go look the up and get better. </p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about which language to learn. Find a language that you like to write in and concentrate learning that language. If you want to increase your odds of employment take C# or Java because those are the popular languages. Look at what companies are putting in their job descriptions for languages and concentrate on those. A general rule of thumb is a good programmer should be able to write in any language that they need to solve a problem. The problem should pick the language. You also may get a job that requires you to use a language you know absolutely nothing about. So running around trying to learn every language isn&#39;t really that good of an idea. </p>

<p>As for telling when you are proficient in a language. The way I tell is by how much programming research I have to do to solve a problem. The less you have to research to figure out how to code a problem the more proficient you are at said language. </p>

<p>Last thing. Don&#39;t be afraid to fail. You will fail a lot and you have to fail a lot because you need to learn. The more times you fail the more you will learn and the closer you will get to your objective. So don&#39;t be  afraid to fail. Just keep trying. Make an adjustment here and there and you will succeed. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>If you were to take 30 kids who had never played basketball (or any other sport), and gave them some minimal training, and told them to practice, then checked on their progress after a month, you&#39;d probably find that some still struggled with the fundamentals while others seem to catch on very quickly.

</div><div class="md"><p>I do think the previous commenter makes an interesting point.  Do you not believe your professor knows what&#39;s important to teach?  (It&#39;s certainly possible).   Do you feel you need others to reinforce it?  Do you think:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Oh, he&#39;s teaching X, but I don&#39;t think X is important (and it&#39;s hard to learn), so I&#39;ll ask some others to see if X really is important, and if it&#39;s not, I won&#39;t bother to learn?</p>
</blockquote>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m not sure this is a good attitude, in general.  This sounds like you&#39;re collecting languages.  It&#39;s like saying, I&#39;ve done learning a few basic things on a piano, let&#39;s move on to a saxophone.  Learning multiple languages, to me, is worse than learning one language extremely well.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a teenager (Timothy Doner, if you&#39;re curious) who is a polyglot.  He speaks multiple (human) languages.  But fluent speakers say he doesn&#39;t speak many of them fluently.  It&#39;s impressive to pick up so many languages, given how difficult it is for many to learn a foreign language, but would it be better if he knew 2-3 really well rather than 20 of them so-so?</p>

<p>Having said that, programming is like fashion.  What&#39;s fashionable is what people learn.  If you had stopped learning to program after learning C or Pascal, you&#39;d be struggling now, so you need some capability to learn new languages.</p>

<p>I&#39;d argue it&#39;s more important to understand how to read code, and write code.  The analogy is that it&#39;s better to learn how to write a book, say, in French, then to barely be able to cobble sentences together in half a dozen languages.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>You&#39;re proficient in a language when you can build solutions to problems with the language. It&#39;s more than knowing just the syntax: you have to be able to apply it to build something. I&#39;d say when you&#39;re able to build something reasonably non-trivial, then you&#39;re proficient enough to be valuable to an employer. </p>

</div><div class="md"><p>The OP is probably talking about how many commands does usually each language take to write a program. How high level it is.</p>

<p>It takes like 5 lines of code in assembly to do an addition. Most languages it is one. Line is java is from semicolon to next and ifs and fors are in their own lines. I&#39;m pretty sure this is what OP meant.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It really doesn&#39;t matter how many lines of code you have; A project with ridiculous amounts of lines won&#39;t be written in a single file anyway, because usually you spread your code to multiply files to maintain organization and structure in your project. </p>

<p>Now, even in a single-file-project (ones you&#39;ll be writing in the beginning of learning programming) lines of code don&#39;t matter, because readability is key; You don&#39;t want to come back after three months and be confused by your own work (we&#39;ve all been there, it&#39;s horrible). Now, a quick example, in Java:</p>

<pre><code>public class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args)
{for(int i=0; i&lt;10;i++){System.out.println(&quot;HelloWorld!&quot;);
}}}


public class HelloWorld {

   public static void main(String[] args) {

        // print out &quot;Hello World!&quot; to the console 10 times
        for(int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {
            System.out.println(&quot;HelloWorld!&quot;);
        }

    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>You&#39;ll notice the first one has a lot less lines of code. You&#39;ll notice you can&#39;t fucking read anything. You&#39;ll notice the code is exactly the same.</p>

<p>Many languages don&#39;t care about spaces and newlines, so use them. Also, use comments to explain your code to yourself and others. Basically, you want to write your programs as if the guy who needs to proof-read, test, and fix it was a sociopathic psycho-killer who knows where you live.</p>

<p>But in terms of what language you should pick to have the highest productivity: That depends on the kind of project you are working on, but as a rule of thumb every language can do the same, some just have cool libraries to help you achieve your goal faster.</p>
