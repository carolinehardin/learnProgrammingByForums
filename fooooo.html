<div class="md"><p>Depends on the meetup, but no, as a general rule, if anyone gets up it will be a regular or special guest with a prepared topic. Usually people will be too busy talking about their projects to make you present yours :) </p>

<p>They&#39;re usually pretty relaxed and friendly.</p>
</div><div class="md"><pre><code>for (int i=0; i&lt;10; i++) {}
</code></pre>

<p>This will make a for loop that runs from 0 to 9, and add 1 to i every iteration. You make an integer that starts at 0. It runs while i is less than 10. Every time it completes a cycle, it adds 1 to i.</p>

<pre><code>for (int i=6; i&lt;=90; i+=4) {}
</code></pre>

<p>This will make a for loop that runs from 6 to 90 in increments of 4, so 6, 10, 14, 18, etc. It makes an integer that atarts at 6. It runs while i is less than or equal to 90. It adds 4 after every cycle.</p>

<p>Now analyze this and try to apply it to your situation.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Most non-trivial problems can be represented in some object oriented way.</p>

<p>For example, why not create a simple, text based combat system of the likes that you&#39;d usually find in an old school RPG (eg, the original Final Fantasy)? So you&#39;ve got a party that contains characters and characters have weapons which have stats. You fight an opponent that is also a character and has their own stats.</p>

<p>So you might start out by creating appropriate objects for the characters and their stats. Let&#39;s keep things simple and have just two stats: health and attack. When a character attacks an opponent, they deal damage equal to their attack stat, which is subtracted from the target&#39;s health. A simplification that can be used early on is having only one-on-one combat where each character alternates turns and can only attack.</p>

<p>Once you have that implemented, implement weapons. Weapons add to existing stats. So a weapon has stats. Further, there can be multiple classes of weapons that provide different damage algorithms. So we might have a superclass <code>Weapon</code> that has a method <code>getDamage(characterStats)</code> and depending on the class of weapon, different stats might be used to determine damage. So a <code>Bow</code> might use a character&#39;s speed stat while a <code>Sword</code> uses the strength stat (etc).</p>

<p>Using your imagination, you could also implement abilities (eg, magical attacks).</p>

<p>There&#39;s no single way to write the code for this, but it&#39;ll provide practice for writing OO code for a problem in which objects are the natural way to represent things (eg, a character, a weapon, and stats can be objects).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You need to fix your syntax. If you have more than one line in your if or else if you need to put it in { }</p>

<p>example:</p>

<p>If (a==b)</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>do this;</p>

<p>do this;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>else</p>

<p>{</p>

<p>Do this:</p>

<p>Do this;</p>

<p>}</p>

<p>if you only have 1 line you dont HAVE to put it around {} but I always do.</p>

<p>Your also missing a ; in the lower middle of your code.</p>

</div><div class="md"><p>Have you considered just rolling your own? Pacman needs very simple graphics:</p>

<ul>
<li>A dot</li>
<li>A bigger, badder dot</li>
<li>Something that vaguely looks like fruit (optional)</li>
<li>A circle with a pie piece missing</li>
<li>A circle with a smaller pie piece missing (to create a sprite animation of an opening and closing mouth; optional)</li>
<li>A ghost, which is a semicircle with Bart&#39;s hair upside down, then white and black dots for eyes.

<ul>
<li>Ghosts are in a couple of colors, with dark blue used for when Pacman is in hungry-ghost-muncher mode.</li>

</ul>

<p>The walls would presumably be traced and thus not an image, but should be straightforward to create if your level design requires an image.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Surely you must know by now that reading code is easier if the code is indented and has syntax highlighting? Half the reason to use Gists is for the syntax highlighting.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>An animated game, or just something like blackjack? I took a similar class, and common projects were Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, War, and one kid did Simon (that game where you press the button that flashes, and try to remember the order).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>That&#39;s what templates are for.  The type becomes a template parameter, not a function parameter, i.e. <code>shufflePrompt&lt;int&gt;(&quot;integer&quot;)</code>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The project euler problems, especially when you get to the higher level ones, can never be solved with brute force, which is what you are doing here. You are creating an algorithm that runs in n<sup>4</sup> time, meaning that given input m, it takes m<sup>4</sup> iterations to complete, which is not feasible at higher values of m. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the answer, but this is something you either have to think very hard about or research a solution for. It&#39;s not going to be as straight-forward as checking every possible solution.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Try printing out what your intermediate values are inside the loop.  In particular, what value you are adding to the running total on every loop iteration.  That should give you a clue on what your bug is.</p>

<p>Try all of these, and see which you like. There are also a ton of guides on Youtube. Watch some videos, learn the very basics, and write some simple code. Buy some books and start reading them. And above all else, practice practice practice. </p>

<p>Also, not to discourage you, but I think you should pick front or back end and stick with it, at least for now. You can certainly become a full stack dev down the road, but IMO it&#39;s best to be somewhat focused while you&#39;re learning. This is a huge undertaking, and there is an enormous amount of information you&#39;re going to be absorbing in the coming months.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>XCode is an IDE, not a programming language.  What language are you using?  What do you mean by add a vector?  We need way more information to help you out.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Python is considered easier than those languages (bar maybe JS), so people recommend it to beginners. The skills are largely transferable anyway.</p>

<p>Try a different language if you want, but being a good programmer is about programming, not the language.</p>
</div><div class="md"><ol>
<li>Python is easy for beginners to learn.</li>
<li>At work you&#39;re probably going to have to learn a bunch of new things anyway, including languages.</li>
<li>Learning additional programming languages is easy once you know how to program.</li>
<li>Python is a language that is extremely handy for all of the other little bits of programming that you end up doing that aren&#39;t exactly parts of whatever software the company makes, but which you need in order to get your job done, or which you need to automate whatever you need automating at home.</li>
<li>Different kinds of jobs use different kinds of languages, so it&#39;s also a matter of what kind of job you want, not just how to qualify yourself for the largest number of jobs.</li>
</ol>
</div><div class="md"><p>The skills you&#39;re learning through Python are very easily translatable to other languages. I started coding with Python and transitioned to Java, C/C++, and C# .NET from there. </p>

<p>Classes, objects, methods/functions, loops, variables, data structures, everything you&#39;re learning in Python can be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>Python is also very easy to learn, and as a result, core concepts of programming are quickly picked up, without getting bogged down with complicated syntax, etc.</p>

<p>Python actually has a LOT of jobs going too, and it&#39;s very useful even if it&#39;s not the main language you&#39;re programming in. If you want to hack together a quick script that pulls data from an SQL database for example, you can do this <em>very</em> quickly!</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from having a whack at other languages too. Java and C# are pretty easy to pick up, and have extensive support online to help you learn.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>As a hiring manager I mostly care that you have knowledge and experience with at least one (preferably object oriented) language.  The concepts are mostly transferrable except with C and C++ where memory management takes a lot more experience.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Not all the jobs are in those languages. I recently applied for a bunch of positions for an internship and here&#39;s the dominant languages they used:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 C#</li>
<li>4 Java</li>
<li>1 Python (plus another that used Python for internal programs)</li>
<li>2 C++</li>
<li>1 JavaScript</li>
</ul>

<p>Not exactly a strong sample size and languages used depends a bit on the area, but the point being that Python jobs exist and aren&#39;t all that uncommon.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>you&#39;re almost like me I want to get a job ASAP, but also I&#39;m learning my basics: algorithms, DS, and yes I know python is great for learning, but not many jobs out there, so I haven&#39;t even touched it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It&#39;s the current sexy language to use in academia. Understanding procedural concepts and then Object Oriented Programming principles using as few semicolons as possible is probably why you are learning it. It will also translate to other languages. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I think u should make your own business and employ your self</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>A programming language is merely a tool used in the job, not the job itself. What you should be focusing on rather than the language is your fundamentals. If I am hiring someone for a position that mainly uses Java, I would still hire someone that can show they know the fundamentals in Python over someone that knows Java, but can&#39;t apply it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Python is good for learning general, transferable programming concepts without forcing the user to learn a bunch of extra stuff that certain languages add/enforce, e.g. object-oriented programming (Java), strict functional programming (Haskell), memory management (C, C++, Rust) etc. All of these concepts are useful and exist for a reason, and most of them can be done in Python, but aren&#39;t necessary to learn just to be able to use the language. That&#39;s my take, anyways. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m pretty sure they want you to get so fed up with indentation errors that you&#39;ll beg for languages with syntactically explicit code blocks no matter how difficult they are to comprehend.</p>

<p>Python had that effect on me.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Write code that you will understand 6 months from now. Write code that your replacement will understand even if the comments were stripped away in some freak accident.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Comment. I read a very interesting blog post on it recently; you can catch it <a href="http://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/">here</a>. Basically, you can have the most elegant and concise code in the world, but that doesn&#39;t explain <em>why</em> it&#39;s there. Commenting also makes you explain yourself. I often catch silly mistakes on my part while commenting code. </p>

<p>You don&#39;t have to comment everything, but concise commenting can really improve you as a programmer! </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;m paraphrasing but don&#39;t get frustrated by your mistakes, see them as an opportunity to learn something.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I&#39;ve said this a bunch of times on this sub; just because your code works don&#39;t think it&#39;s done.  Go back and make it better.  Rafactor it.  Comment it.  Whatever, just don&#39;t move on until it&#39;s the best you can make it.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I have absolutely no idea about anything involving programming, but i&#39;m interested in learning.</p>

<p>It is a good idea buying this, or i&#39;d need to have some previous knowledge?</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>The question is pretty much impossible to understand. Are you missing information about the format of the input file?</p>

<p>Otherwise I&#39;m afraid your prof, TAs, and peers are probably the only ones who will be able to help.</p>

</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>I cannot figure out how to properly insert the equations into my code without running into an error or two.</p>

<p>The code you posted doesn&#39;t show you trying this, so we can&#39;t tell what might have been wrong with what you were trying to do.</p>

<p>The general form to assign values to variables with arithmetic after reading them from the user is:</p>

<pre><code>assignedVariable = val1 + val2;  // for addition
assignedVariable = val1 / val2;   // for division
assignedVariable = val1 - val2;   // for subtraction
assignedVariable = val1 * val2;   // for multiplication

</div><div class="md"><p>Also, I just want to thank the community of this subreddit for their help. I work near full-time and it is difficult to line up my work schedule with the open hours of the computer programming tutor center.
I realize my last line of code does not match up with the example, I was trying to figure out how to calculate the total before figuring out how to find the miles.</p>

<p>Ignore the numbers presented from this photo, they are simply there as an example of input.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>without other data structures i believe you could do two things, </p>

<p>a) loop over the whole array and check if it contains the value</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>b) create a new array whose indices represent the possible numbers + 1 (so 0-9), and contains boolean values, if you set a value you set the corresponding value in the array at index &quot;value&quot; to true and check it later when assigning other values</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>It sounds like what you actually want to do is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisher%E2%80%93Yates_shuffle">shuffle</a> a list, for which Java provides a <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Collections.html#shuffle%28java.util.List%29">library function</a>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>I haven&#39;t thought this out a ton, so bear with me. </p>

<p>But what about having an array list that keeps track of used numbers. If the number is used, then try again. If not, then keep it. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sounds like what you&#39;re describing is a problem space for which a structure called a &quot;prefix tree&quot; was originally developed. Also known as a &quot;trie.&quot;</p>

<p>I imagine the prefix tree would be more efficient, depending on what you&#39;re actually trying to get out of this thing. For instance, it&#39;s practically purpose-built for completion. </p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Sounds like you want a proper index, why don&#39;t you use some existing application with index support (a database!), and don&#39;t push your full database to the client for searching (I understand it depends on your use case, but sending everything to the client seems like a waste).</p>

<p>As for actually doing it yourself, is there any reason you need to stick with json? My gut instinct would be to make a quick index, for example, remove the first three letters of every word, and just sequentially place those in a file with some separator. Then prepend that with an index containing the location of each block of words, now you application takes the first three letters, looks up the location by reading the bytes referencing that location, and sequentially searches the words starting with those letters. You&#39;d drastically reduce the amount of data your application would need to read (JSON requires the whole file is parsed).</p>

<p>A proper index that a database would give you is way better than what I outlined though, it will not only reduce the work and bandwidth required by the clients, but perform a better job at searching as well.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Why not shove this in a database and let the database handle it? It&#39;s what they were made to do.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>You basically want an algorithms book. The kinds of algorithms discussed in such a book will usually be very general purpose ones, though. They&#39;re more interested in problems like &quot;given a graph with weights denoting the maximum flow along an edge, what is the max flow rate that can be achieved from one vertex of the graph to another?&quot; (max flow) or &quot;given a list of orderable values, how can I sort them?&quot; (sorting algorithms).</p>

<p>As a result, such books usually won&#39;t mention things like calculating eigenvalues or algorithms to find square roots.</p>

<p>An example of such a book is Cormen&#39;s <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em>.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Use a for loop instead of a while loop, that will make it easy to include a counter to limit the amount of times the loop executes (and a <code>break;</code> will still cause you to exit the loop on success).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Great attempt. You know that the user only gets five attempts. However, because of line 3, &quot;while(1)&quot;, the loop goes on forever.<br/>
This can be fixed by either using a for-loop instead of a while loop, or making a new integer that keeps track of the user attempts.<br/>
For example, lets say you make a new integer, &quot;int attempt = 0;&quot;. You could then change your while loop to be, &quot;while (attempt &lt; 5)&quot;, and after your loop checks all three cases, you can add an instruction, &quot;attempt++;&quot; to increment your attempt variable.</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>your loop should look something like this:</p>

<pre><code>for(i = 0; i &lt; maxGuesses &amp;&amp; scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;guess) == 1 &amp;&amp; guess != Randy; i++)
</code></pre>

<p>no need for a <code>break;</code> in this case</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>Please ask a specific question. Dumping the entire assignment from the book and a couple hundred lines of code is not being specific.</p>
</div><div class="md"><blockquote>
<p>would I be okay in saying that I can easily learn Python given what I already have done with F#?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sure, but not really meaningful. It&#39;s assumed that competent programmers can learn new languages (with familiar programming paradigms).</p>
</div><div class="md"><p>When you are calling Float.ToString, use</p>

<pre><code>String.format(Locale.US, &quot;%f&quot;, myFloat)

<p>instead. hope this helps!</p>

<p>More info on the problem: Float.ToString() is locale-sensitive, and as some countries format decimal places with &#39;,&#39; instead of &#39;.&#39; we can run into problems! Float.Parse however is not locale-sensitive, and always expects a &#39;.&#39; which is where your problem was
